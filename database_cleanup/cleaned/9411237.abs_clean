In this paper we calculate the particle creation as seen by a stationaryobserver in an anisotropic universe. By using an observer and geometrydependent time to quantise a massive scalar field we show that a discreteenergy spectrum shift occurs. The length scale associated with the geometryprovides the energy scale by which the spectrum is shifted. The $\beta(p,q)$coefficient for the Bogolubov transformation calculated is proportional to aseries of delta functions whose argument contains $p$ and $q$ and halfmultiples of the root of the curvature.
