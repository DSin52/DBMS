I study a class of Wilsonian formulations of non-Abelian gauge theories inalgebraic noncovariant gauges where the Wilsonian infrared cutoff $\Lambda$ isinserted as a mass term for the propagating fields. In this way theWard-Takahashi identities are preserved to all scales. Nevertheless theBRS-invariance in broken and the theory is gauge-dependent and unphysical at$\Lambda\neq0$. Then I discuss the infrared limit $\Lambda\to0$. I show thatthe singularities of the axial gauge choice are avoided in planar gauge and inlight-cone gauge. Finally the rectangular Wilson loop of size $2L\times 2T$ isevaluated at lowest order in perturbation theory and a noncommutativity betweenthe limits $\Lambda\to0$ and $T\to\infty$ is pointed out.
