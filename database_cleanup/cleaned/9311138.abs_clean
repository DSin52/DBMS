We review the construction of exactly solvable lattice models whose continuumlimits are $N=2$ supersymmetric models. Both critical and off-critical modelsare discussed. The approach we take is to first find lattice models withnatural topological sectors, and then identify the continuum limits of thesesectors with topologically twisted $N=2$ supersymmetric field theories. Fromthis, we then describe how to recover the complete lattice versions of the$N=2$ supersymmetric field theories. We discuss a number of simple physicalexamples and we describe how to construct a broad class of models. We also givea brief review of the scattering matrices for the excitations of these models.(Contribution to the procedings of the Cargese meeting on ``String Theory,Conformal Models and Topological Field Theories'', May 12-21, 1993.)
