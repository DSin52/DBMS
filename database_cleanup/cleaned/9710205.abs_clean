given by Mikhail Polikarpov at the Workshop "Confinement, Duality andNon-Perturbative Aspects of QCD", Cambridge (UK), 24 June - 4 July 1997;figures are rearrangedThe monopole confinement mechanism in the abelian projection of latticelattice and in the continuum, a numerical study of the abelian monopoles in thelattice gauge theory. Additionally, we briefly review the notation ofdifferential forms, duality, and the BKT transformation in the lattice gaugetheories.
