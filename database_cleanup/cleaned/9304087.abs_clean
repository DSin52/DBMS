In a previous paper [\AS], we used superspace techniques to prove thatperturbation theory (around a classical solution with no zero modes) forChern--Simons quantum field theory on a general $3$-manifold $M$ is finite. Weconjectured (and proved for the case of $2$-loops) that, after addingcounterterms of the expected form, the terms in the perturbation theory definetopological invariants. In this paper we prove this conjecture. Our proof usesa geometric compactification of the region on which the Feynman integrand ofFeynman diagrams is smooth as well as an extension of the basic propagator ofthe theory.
