It was recently pointed out by E. Witten that for a D-brane to consistentlywrap a submanifold of some manifold, the normal bundle must admit a Spin^cstructure. We examine this constraint in the case of type II stringcompactifications with vanishing cosmological constant, and argue that in allsuch cases, the normal bundle to a supersymmetric cycle is automaticallySpin^c.
