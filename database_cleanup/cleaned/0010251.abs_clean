We show that the fluxon solution of the non-commutative gauge theory and itsvariations are obtained by the soliton generation method recently given by J.A. Harvey, P. Kraus and F. Larsen [hep-th/0010060]. Although this methodgenerally produces non-BPS solutions of equations of motion, the solutions weobtained are BPS. We give the brane interpretation of these BPS solutions andstudy their counterparts in the ordinary description by the Seiberg-Witten map.
