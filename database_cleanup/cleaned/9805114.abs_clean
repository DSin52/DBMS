Title: The Holographic Bound in Anti-de Sitter Space

Comments: 10 pages, phyzzx

The correspondence between string theory in Anti-de Sitter space and superYang Mills theory is an example of the Holographic principle according to whicha quantum theory with gravity must be describable by a boundary theory.However, arguments given so far are incomplete because, while the bulk theoryhas been related to a boundary theory, the holographic bound saying that theboundary theory has only one bit of information per Planck area has not beenjustified. We show here that this bound is the physical interpretation of oneof the unusual aspects of the correspondence between Anti-de Sitter space andthe boundary conformal field theory, which is that infrared effects in the bulktheory are reflected as ultraviolet effects in the boundary theory.
