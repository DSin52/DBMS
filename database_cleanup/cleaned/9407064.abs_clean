We point out that using the heat kernel on a cone to compute the firstquantum correction to the entropy of Rindler space does not yield the correcttemperature dependence. In order to obtain the physics at arbitrary temperatureone must compute the heat kernel in a geometry with different topology (withouta conical singularity). This is done in two ways, which are shown to agree withcomputations performed by other methods. Also, we discuss the ambiguities inthe regularization procedure.
