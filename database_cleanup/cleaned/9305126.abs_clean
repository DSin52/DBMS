The one-plaquette Hamiltonian of large N lattice gauge theory offers aconstructive model of a $1+1$-dimensional string theory with a stable groundstate.The free energy is found to be equivalent to the partition function of astring where the world sheet is discretized by even polygons with signature andthe link factor is given by a non-Gaussian propagator.At large, but finite, N we derive the nonperturbative density of states fromthe WKB wave function and the dispersion relations. This is expressible as aninfinite, but convergent, series with the inverse of the hypergeometricfunction replacing the harmonic oscillator spectrum of the $1+1$-dimensionalstring. In the scaling limit, the series is shown to be finite, containing boththe perturbative (asymptotic) expansion of the inverted harmonic oscillatormodel, and a nonperturbative piece that survives the scaling limit.
