Title: From Quantum Planes to Quantum Groups and back; Cartan Calculus

Comments: 49 pages

A Cartan Calculus of Lie derivatives, differential forms, and innerderivations, based on an undeformed Cartan identity, is constructed. We attempta classification of various types of quantum Lie algebras and present a fairlygeneral example for their construction, utilizing pure braid methods, provingorthogonality of the adjoint representation and giving a (Killing) metric andthe quadratic casimir. A reformulation of the Cartan calculus as a braidedalgebra and its extension to quantum planes, directly and induced from thegroup calculus, are provided.
