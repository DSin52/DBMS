We consider a class of four parameter D=4, N=2 string models, namelyheterotic strings compactified on K3 times T2 together with their dual type IIpartners on Calabi-Yau three-folds. With the help of generalized modular forms(such as Siegel and Jacobi forms), we compute the perturbative prepotential andthe perturbative Wilsonian gravitational coupling F1 for each of the models inthis class. We check heterotic/type II duality for one of the models byrelating the modular forms in the heterotic description to the known instantonnumbers in the type II description. We comment on the relation of our resultsto recent proposals for closely related models.
