Two-dimensional matterless dilaton gravity is a topological theory and can beclassically reduced to a (0+1)-dimensional theory with a finite number ofdegrees of freedom. If quantization is performed, a simple gauge invariantquantum mechanics is obtained. The properties of the gauge invariant operatorsand of the Hilbert space of physical states can be determined. In particular,for N-dimensional pure gravity with (N-2)-dimensional spherical symmetry, thesquare of the ADM mass operator is self-adjoint, not the mass itself.
