We study the thermodynamics of four-dimensional Kerr-Newman-AdS black holesboth in the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble. The stabilityconditions are investigated, and the complete phase diagrams are obtained,which include the Hawking-Page phase transition in the grand-canonicalensemble. In the canonical case, one has a first order transition between smalland large black holes, which disappears for sufficiently large electric chargeor angular momentum. This disappearance corresponds to a critical point in thephase diagram. Via the AdS/CFT conjecture, the obtained phase structure is alsorelevant for the corresponding conformal field theory living in a rotatingEinstein universe, in the presence of a global background U(1) current. Aninteresting limit arises when the black holes preserve some supersymmetry.These BPS black holes correspond to highly degenerate zero temperature statesin the dual CFT, which lives in an Einstein universe rotating with the speed oflight.
