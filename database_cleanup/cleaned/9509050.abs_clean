We suggest that for singular rotationally invariant closed string backgroundswhich need sources for their support at the origin (in particular, for specialplane waves and fundamental strings) certain `trivial' \a'-corrections (whichare usually ignored since in the absence of sources they can be eliminated by afield redefinition) may play an important role eliminating the singularities inthe exact solutions. These corrections effectively regularize the sourcedelta-function at the \a'-scale. We demonstrate that similar smearing of thesingularity of the leading-order point-source solution indeed takes place inthe open string theory.
