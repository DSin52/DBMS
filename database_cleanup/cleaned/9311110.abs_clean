Recently it has been argued, that Poincar\'{e} supersymmetric field theoriesadmit an underlying loop space hamiltonian (symplectic) structure. Here shallestablish this at the level of a general $N=1$ supermultiplet. In particular,we advocate the use of a superloop space and explain the necessity of usingnonconventional auxiliary fields. As an example we consider the nonlinear$\sigma$-model. Due to the quartic fermionic term, we conclude that the use ofsuperloop space variables is necessary for the action to have a hamiltonianloop space interpretation.
