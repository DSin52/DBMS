55-66The structure of the QFT expansion is studied in the framework of a new"Invariant analytic" version of the perturbative QCD. Here, an invariant(running) coupling $a(Q^2/\Lambda^2)=\beta_1\alpha_s(Q^2)/4\pi$ is transformedinto a "$Q^2$--analytized" invariant coupling $a_{\rm an}(Q^2/\Lambda^2) \equiv{\cal A}(x)$ which, by constuction, is free of ghost singularities due toincorporating some nonperturbative structures.Meanwhile, the "analytized" perturbation expansion for an observable $F$, incontrast with the usual case, may contain specific functions ${\cal A}_n(x)=[a^n(x)]_{\rm an}$, the "n-th power of $a(x)$ analytized as a whole", insteadof $({\cal A}(x))^n$. In other words, the pertubation series for $F(x)$, due toanalyticity imperative, may change its form turning into an {\it asymptoticexpansion \`a la Erd\'elyi over a nonpower set} $\{{\cal A}_n(x)\}$.We analyse sets of functions $\{{\cal A}_n(x)\}$ and discuss properties ofnon-power expansion arising with their relations to feeble loop and schemedependence of observables.The issue of ambiguity of the invariant analytization procedure and ofpossible inconsistency of some of its versions with the RG structure is alsodiscussed.
