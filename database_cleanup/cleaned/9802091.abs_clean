Title: Matrix Theory in Curved Space

Comments: 7 pages, Latex, Talk presented at the Birthday Conference dedicated

to A.Arvilski, February, 1998; one ref. addedAccording to the Matrix theory proposal of Banks, Fischler, Shenker andSusskind M-theory in the infinite momentum frame is the large N limit of superYang-Mills theory in a flat background. To address some physical issues ofclassical gravity such as gravitational collapse and cosmological expansion weconsider an extension of the BFSS proposal by defining M-theory in curved spaceas the large N limit of super Yang-Mills theory in a curved background.Motivations and possible implications of this extension are discussed.
