Authors: M. Rudolph

Comments: 25 pages, 11 figures

This is the written version of a short talk given at the University ofLeipzig in December 1998. It reviews some general aspects of string theory fromthe viewpoint of the search for an unifying theory. Here, special emphasis lieson the motivation to consider string theory not only as the leading candidatefor the unification of gravity and the other fundamental forces of nature, butalso as a possible step towards a new understanding of nature and itsdescription within the framework of physical models. Without going intodetails, some recent developments, including duality symmetries and theappearance of $M$--theory, are reviewed.
