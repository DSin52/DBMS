S-matrices for integrable perturbations of $N=2$ superconformal fieldtheories are studied. The models we consider correspond to perturbations of thecoset theory $G_k \times H_{g-h} /H_{k+g-h} $. The perturbed models are closelyrelated to $\hat G$-affine Toda theories with a background charge tuned to $H$.Using the quantum group restriction of the affine Toda theories we derive theS-matrix.
