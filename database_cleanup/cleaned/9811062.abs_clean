We consider the photon field between an unusual configuration of infiniteinfinitely permeable one $\mu\to\infty)$. After quantizing the vector potentialin the Coulomb gauge, we obtain explicit expressions for the vacuum expectationvalues of field operators of the form $<{\hat E}_i{\hat E}_j>_0$ and $<{\hatB}_i{\hat B}_j>_0$. These field correlators allow us to reobtain the Casimireffect for this set up and to discuss the light velocity shift caused by thepresence of plates (Scharnhorst effect \cite{Scharnhorst,Barton,BarScharn}) forboth scalar and spinor QED.
