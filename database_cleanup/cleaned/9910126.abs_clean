Supergravity on $AdS_3\times S^3\times {\bf T}^4$ has a dual description as aconformal sigma-model with the target space being the moduli space ofinstantons on the noncommutative torus. We derive the precise relation betweenthe parameters of this noncommutative torus and the parameters of thenear-horizon geometry. We show that the low energy dynamics of the system of$D1D5$ branes wrapped on the torus of finite size is described in terms of thenoncommutative geometry. As a byproduct, we give a prediction on the dependenceof the moduli space of instantons on the noncommutative ${\bf T}^4$ on themetric and the noncommutativity parameter. We give a compelling evidence thatthe moduli space of stringy instantons on ${\bf R}^4$ with the $B$ field doesnot receive $\alpha'$-corrections. We also study the relation between the$D1D5$ sigma-model instantons and the supergravity instantons.
