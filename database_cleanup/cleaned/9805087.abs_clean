Anti-de Sitter space with identified points give rise to black-holestructures. This was first pointed out in three dimensions, and generalized tohigher dimensions by Aminneborg et al. In this paper, we analyse severalaspects of the five dimensional anti-de Sitter black hole including, itsrelation to thermal anti-de Sitter space, its embedding in a Chern-Simonssupergravity theory, its global charges and holonomies, and the existence ofKilling spinors.
