Conference on Geometry, Integrability and Quantization, which was held inJune 14--23, 2001 in BulgariaGeometryWe study a quantum system in a Riemannian manifold M on which a Lie group Gacts isometrically. The path integral on M is decomposed into a family of pathintegrals on a quotient space Q=M/G and the reduced path integrals arecompletely classified by irreducible unitary representations of G. It is notnecessary to assume that the action of G on M is either free or transitive.Hence the quotient space M/G may have orbifold singularities. Stratificationgeometry, which is a generalization of the concept of principal fiber bundle,is necessarily introduced to describe the path integral on M/G. Using it weshow that the reduced path integral is expressed as a product of three factors;the rotational energy amplitude, the vibrational energy amplitude, and theholonomy factor.
