(the 1-loop partition function of a closed string, sometimes called a modularinvariant), and a representation of the fusion ring (called a NIM-rep orequivalently a fusion graph, and closely related to the 1-loop partitionfunction of an open string). In this paper we develop some basic theory ofNIM-reps, obtain several new NIM-rep classifications, and compare them with thecorresponding modular invariant classifications. Among other things, we makemodular invariants which do not correspond to any NIM-rep. The resolution couldbe that those modular invariants are physically sick. Is classifying modularinvariants really the right thing to do? For current algebras, the answer seems
