In this paper we consider orbifold compactifications of M-theory on $S^1/{\bfZ}_2\times T^4/{\bf Z}_2$. We discuss solutions of the local anomaly matchingconditions by twisted vector, tensor and hypermultiplets confined on the localorbifold six-planes. In addition we consider phase-transitions among differentsolutions which are mediated by M-theory fivebranes which touch the localorbifold planes and are converted there to gauge instantons.
