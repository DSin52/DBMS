We investigate the Ward identities of the $W_{\infty}$ symmetry in theLiouville theory coupled to the $(p,q)$ conformal matter. The correlationfunctions are defined by applying the analytic continuation procedure for thematter sector as well as the Liouville one. We then find that the Wardidentities are equivalent to the $W_q$ algebra constraints deduced from thematrix model.
