A unified and systematic scheme for constraction of differential opreatorrealization of any irreducible representation of $sl(n)$ is developed. The$q$-analogue of this unified scheme is used to constract $q$-differenceoperator realization of any irreducible representation of $U_q(sl(n))$.Explicit results for $U_q(sl(2))$, $U_q(sl(3))$ and $U_q(sl(n))$ are given.
