We obtain new intersecting 5-brane, string and pp-wave solutions in theheterotic string on a torus and on a K3 manifold. In the former case the5-brane is supported by Yang-Mills instantons, and in the latter case both the5-brane and the string are supported by the instantons. The instanton moduliare parameterised by the sizes and locations of the instantons. We exhibit twokinds of phase transition in which, for suitable choices of the instantonmoduli, a 5-brane and/or a string can be created. One kind of phase transitionoccurs when the size of an instanton vanishes, while the other occurs when apair of Yang-Mills instantons coalesce. We also study the associatedfive-dimensional black holes and the implications of these phase transitionsfor the black-hole entropy. Specifically, we find that the entropy of thethree-charge black holes is zero when the instantons are separated and ofnon-zero scale size, but becomes non-zero (which can be counted miscrospically)after either of the phase transitions.
