The dynamics of Liouville fields coupled to gravity are investigated byapplying the principle of general covariance to the Liouville action in thecontext of a particular form of two-dimensional dilaton gravity. The resultantfield equations form a closed system for the Liouville/gravity interaction. Alarge class of asymptotically flat solutions to the field equations isobtained, many of which can be interpreted as black hole solutions. Thetemperature of such black holes is proportional to their mass-parameters. Anexact solution to the back reaction problem is obtained to one-loop order, bothfor conformally coupled matter fields and for the quantized metric/Liouvillesystem. Quantum effects are shown to map the space of classical solutions intoone another. A scenario for the end-point of black-hole radiation is discussed.
