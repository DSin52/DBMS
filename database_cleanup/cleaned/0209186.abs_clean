Nonperturbative solutions to the nonlinear field equations in the NS sectorof cubic as well as nonpolynomial superstring field theory can be obtained froma linear equation which includes a "spectral" parameter \lambda and acoboundary operator Q(\lambda). We borrow a simple ansatz from the dressingmethod (for generating solitons in integrable field theories) and show thatclassical superstring fields can be constructed from any string field T subjectmerely to Q(\lambda)T=0. Following the decay of the non-BPS D9 brane in IIAtheory and shifting the background to the tachyon vacuum, we repeat thearguments in vacuum superstring field theory and outline how to computeclassical solutions explicitly.
