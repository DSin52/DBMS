Title: Uniqueness of D=11 Supergravity

Comments: 15 pages. Lecture at "Quantum Mechanics of Fundamental Systems VI",

Santiago, Chile, August 1997We study the extent to which D=11 supergravity can be deformed and show intwo very different ways that, unlike lower D versions, it forbids an extensionwith cosmological constant. Some speculations about other invariants are made,in connection with the possible counterterms of the theory.
