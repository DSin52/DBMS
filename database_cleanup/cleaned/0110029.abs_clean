Positive frequency Wightman function and vacuum expectation values of theenergy-momentum tensor are computed for a massive scalar field with generalcurvature coupling parameter and satisfying Robin boundary condition on auniformly accelerated infinite plate. The both regions of the right Rindlerwedge, (i) on the right (RR region) and (ii) on the left (RL region) of theplate are investigated. For the case (ii) the electromagnetic field isconsidered as well. The mode summation method is used with combination of avariant of the generalized Abel-Plana formula. This allows to present theexpectation values in the form of a sum of the purely Rindler and boundaryparts. Near the plate surface the vacuum energy-momentum tensor is dominated bythe boundary term. At large distances from the plate and near the Rindlerhorizon the main contribution comes from the purely Rindler part. In the RLregion the vacuum energy density of the electromagnetic field is negative nearthe horizon and is positive near the plate.
