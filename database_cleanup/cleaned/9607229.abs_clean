We construct open descendants of Gepner models, concentrating mainly on thesix-dimensional case, where they give type I vacua with rich patterns ofChan-Paton symmetry breaking and various numbers of tensor multiplets,including zero. We also relate the models in $D < 10$ without open sectors,recently found by other authors, to the generalized Klein-bottle projectionsallowed by the crosscap constraint.
