Title: Open strings, Born--Infeld action and the heat kernel

Authors: W. Kummer, D.V. Vassilevich

Comments: 9 pages, an important note is added at the end of the paper

In the derivation of the Born-Infeld action for the case with a nontrivialboundary of the string world sheet the appearance of a new term changes theconformal anomaly. This may have many consequences, especially also in thestudy of generalized interacting brane systems.
