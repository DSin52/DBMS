As in the first part of this paper (hep-th 9204092), solutions to a stringequation are regarded as fixed points of some additional symmetries of athe multi-component KP and KdV hierarchies, and the modified KdV hierarchy astheir reduction. In particular, the action of additional symmetries on theGrassmannian is found, as well as Virasoro constraints on the $\tau$-functions.The matrix string equations are known to be involved in some matrix models.
