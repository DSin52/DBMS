Finding solutions to non-linear field theories, such as Yang-Mills theoriesor general relativity, is usually difficult. The field equations of Yang-Millstheories and general relativity are known to share some mathematicalsimilarities, and this connection can be used to find solutions to one theoryusing known solutions of the other theory. For example, the Schwarzschildsolutions of general relativity can be shown to have a mathematically similarcounterpart in Yang-Mills theory. In this article we will discuss severalsolutions to the Yang-Mills equations which can be found using this connectionbetween general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. Some comments about thepossible physical meaning of these solutions will be discussed. In particularit will be argued that some of these analog solutions of Yang-Mills theory mayhave some connection with the confinement phenomenon. To this end we willbriefly look at the motion of test particles moving in the background potentialof the Schwarzschild analog solution.
