The Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebra E11, obtained by doubly overextending thecompact E8, is decomposed into representations of its canonical hyperbolic E10subalgebra. Whereas the appearing representations at levels 0 and 1 are knownon general grounds, higher level representations can currently only be obtainedby recursive methods. We present the results of such an analysis up to height120 in E11 which comprises representations on the first five levels. Thealgorithms used are a combination of Weyl orbit methods and standard methodsbased on the Peterson and Freudenthal formulae. In the appendices we give allmultiplicities of E10 occuring up to height 340 and for E11 up to height 240.
