We study N=1 dualities in four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories by D6-branes wrapping around 3-cycles of Calabi-Yau threefolds in the type IIAstring theory. We consider the models involving $SU(N_{c1})\times SU(N_{c2})$product gauge group without or with adjoint matter in terms of geometricalrealisation of the configuration of D 6-branes wrapped 3-cycles. We also findsimple geometric description for the triple product gauge group$SU(N_{c1})\times SU(N_{c2})\times SU(N_{c3})$ interpreted recently by Brodieand Hanany in the context of D brane configurations together with NS 5-branes.Their introduction of semi-infinite D 4-branes appears naturally by looking atthe flavor group in the dual theory. We generalize to product of arbitrarynumber of gauge groups.
