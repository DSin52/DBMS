2355The properties of static spherically symmetric black holes, which are bothelectrically and magnetically charged, and which are coupled to the dilaton inthe presence of a cosmological constant, Lambda, are considered. It is shownthat apart from the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter solution with constantdilaton, such solutions do not exist if Lambda > 0 (in arbitrary spacetimedimension >=4 ). However, asymptotically anti-de Sitter dyonic black holesolutions with a non-trivial dilaton do exist if Lambda < 0. Both thesesolutions and the asymptotically flat (Lambda = 0) solutions are studiednumerically for arbitrary values of the dilaton coupling parameter, g_0, infour dimensions. The asymptotically flat solutions are found to exhibit twohorizons if g_0 = 0, 1, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{6}, ..., \sqrt{n(n+1)/2},..., and onehorizon otherwise. For asymptotically anti-de Sitter solutions the result issimilar, but the corresponding values of g_0 are altered in a non-linearfashion which depends on Lambda and the mass and charges of the black holes.All dyonic solutions with Lambda <= 0 are found to have zero Hawkingtemperature in the extreme limit, however, regardless of the value of g_0.
