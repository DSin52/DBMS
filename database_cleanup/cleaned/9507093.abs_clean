Non-perturbative exact flow equations describe the scale dependence of theeffective average action. We present a numerical solution for an approximateform of the flow equation for the potential in a three-dimensional N-componentscalar field theory. The critical behaviour, with associated criticalexponents, can be inferred with good accuracy.
