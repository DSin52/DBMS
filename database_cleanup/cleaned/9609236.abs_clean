Title: Exact Renormalization Group with Fermions

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX with sprocl.sty, talk given at RG96, Dubna

The development of the Exact Renormalization Group for fermionic theories ispresented, together with its application to the chiral Gross-Neveu model. Wefocus on the reliability of various approximations, specifically the derivativeexpansion and further truncations in the number of fields. The main differenceswith bosonic theories are discussed.
