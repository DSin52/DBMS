We extend a recent work by Mussardo and Penati on integrable quantum fieldtheories with a single stable particle and an infinite number of unstableresonance states, including the presence of a boundary. The correspondingscattering and reflection amplitudes are expressed in terms of Jacobianelliptic functions, and generalize the ones of the massive thermal Ising modeland of the Sinh-Gordon model. In the case of the generalized Ising model weexplicitly study the ground state energy and the one-point function of thethermal operator in the short-distance limit, finding an oscillating behaviourrelated to the fact that the infinite series of boundary resonances does notdecouple from the theory even at very short-distance scales. The analysis ofthe generalized Sinh-Gordon model with boundary reveals an interestingconstraint on the analytic structure of the reflection amplitude. The roaminglimit procedure which leads to the Ising model, in fact, can be consistentlyperformed only if we admit that the nature of the bulk spectrum uniquely fixesthe one of resonance states on the boundary.
