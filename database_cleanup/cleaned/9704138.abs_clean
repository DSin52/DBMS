Authors: Noureddine Chair

Comments: 18 pages, LaTeX. Minor adjustment to references

The potential that generates the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian is givenin terms of the elementary symmetric functions using the Waring formula thatcomputes the power sum of roots of an algebraic equation in terms of itscoefficients. As a consequence, the fusion potential for $su(N)_K$ is obtained.This potential is the explicit Chebyshev polynomial in several variables of thefirst kind. We also derive the fusion potential for $sp(N)_K$ from a reciprocalalgebraic equation. This potential is identified with another Chebyshevpolynomial in several variables. We display a connection between these fusionpotentials and generalized Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.
