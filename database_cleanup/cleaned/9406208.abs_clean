We present a ``topological'' formulation of arbitrarily shaped vortex stringsin four dimensional field theory. By using a large Higgs mass expansion, wethen evaluate the effective action of the closed Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesenvortex string. It is shown that the effective action contains the Nambu-Gototerm and an extrinsic curvature squared term with negative sign. We nextevaluate the topological $\FtF$ term and find that it becomes the sum of anordinary self-intersection number and Polyakov's self-intersection number ofthe world sheet swept by the vortex string. These self-intersection numbers arerelated to the self-linking number and the total twist number, respectively.Furthermore, the $\FtF$ term turns out to be the difference between the sum ofthe writhing numbers and the linking numbers of the vortex strings at theinitial time and the one at the final time. When the vortex string is coupledto fermions, the chiral fermion number of the vortex string becomes thewrithing number (modulo $\bZ$) through the chiral anomaly. Our formulation isalso applied to ``global'' vortex strings in a model with a broken global$U(1)$ symmetry.
