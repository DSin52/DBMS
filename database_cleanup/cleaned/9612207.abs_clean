We develop a systematic approach to confinement in N=1 supersymmetrictheories. We identify simple necessary conditions for theories to confinewithout chiral symmetry breaking and to generate a superpotentialnon-perturbatively (s-confine). Applying these conditions we identify all N=1theories with a single gauge group and no tree-level superpotential whichs-confine. We give a complete list of the confined spectra and superpotentials.Some of these theories are of great interest for model building. We giveseveral new examples of models which break supersymmetry dynamically.
