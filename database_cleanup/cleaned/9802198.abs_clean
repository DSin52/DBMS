A large class of extremal and near-extremal four dimensional black holes inM-theory feature near horizon geometries that contain three dimensionalasymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces. Globally, these geometries are derivedfrom AdS_3 by discrete identifications. The microstates of such black holes canbe counted by exploiting the conformal symmetry induced on the anti-de Sitterboundary, and the result agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. Thisapproach, pioneered by Strominger, clarifies the physical nature of the blackhole microstates. It also suggests that recent analyses of the relationshipbetween boundary conformal field theory and supergravity can be extended toorbifolds of AdS spaces.
