Using a simple observation based on holomorphy, we argue that any model whichspontaneously breaks supersymmetry for some range of a parameter will do sogenerically for all values of that parameter, modulo some isolated exceptionalpoints. Conversely, a model which preserves supersymmetry for some range of aparameter will also do so everywhere except at isolated exceptional points. Wediscuss how these observations can be useful in the construction of new modelswhich break supersymmetry and discuss some simple examples. We also comment onthe relation of these results to the Witten index.
