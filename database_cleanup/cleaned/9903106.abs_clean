The possibility of non-trivial representations of the gauge group onwavefunctionals of a gauge invariant quantum field theory leads to a generationof mass for intermediate vector and tensor bosons. The mass parameters m showup as central charges in the algebra of constraints, which then become ofsecond-class nature. The gauge group coordinates acquire dynamics outside thenull-mass shell and provide the longitudinal field degrees of freedom thatmassless bosons need to form massive bosons. This is a `non-Higgs' mechanismthat could provide new clues for the best understanding of the symmetrybreaking mechanism in unified field theories. A unified quantization ofmassless and massive non-Abelian Yang-Mills, linear Gravity and Abeliantwo-form gauge field theories are fully developed from this new approach, wherea cohomological origin of mass is pointed out.
