We complete the list of fluxbrane solutions in classical supergravities byintroducing Melvin type space-times supported by antisymmetric forms of rank$D-1$ and their pseudoscalar duals. In IIB theory these solutions belong to thesame family as the seven-brane and D-instanton. In current notation, afluxbrane supported by the D-1 form is an F0 brane, its euclidean continuationis a cylindrical background which ``interacts'' with a pointlike instanton. Thegeneral F0 brane can have a transverse space S_k times R^{(D-k-2)} with 1 <= k<= D-2. For k=1 we find the complete solution containing four parameters, threeof them associated with pointlike singularities on the Melvin-type background.The S-dual to the F0 brane in ten dimensions is the F8 fluxbrane of codimensionone, or F-wall, similar fluxbranes exist in any dimensions if an appropriateform field is present. F-walls contain naked singularities unless oneintroduces source branes. In such a way one obtains new brane-world typesolutions with two bulk scalar fields. Their relation to the supersymmetricbrane-worlds is discussed.
