Title: Noncommutativity as a Possible Origin of the Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray

and the TeV-photon ParadoxesAuthors: Shao-Xia Chen and Zhao-Yu Yang

Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure

In this paper, we present a general modified dispersion relation derived fromq-deformed noncommutative theory and apply it to the ultrahigh energy cosmicray and the TeV-photon paradoxes--threshold anomalies. Our purpose is not onlytrying to solve these puzzles by noncommutative theory but also to supportnoncommutative theory through the coincidence of the region in the parameterspace for resolving the threshold anomalies with the one from the q-deformednoncommutative theory.
