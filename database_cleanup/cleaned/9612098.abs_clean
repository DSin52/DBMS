Title: Notes on SL(2) conformal fields theories. Exact solution and

applicationsAuthors: Oleg Andreev (Ecole Normale Superieure and Landau Institute for

Theoretical Physics)Comments: 5 pages, latex2.09, talk presented at the International Symposium on

In these notes I briefly outline SL(2) degenerate conformal field theoriesand their application to some related models, namely 2d gravity and N=2discrete superconformal series.
