Differential regularization is applied to a field theory of anon-relativistic charged boson field $\phi$ with $\lambda (\phi {}^{*} \phi)^2$self-interaction and coupling to a statistics-changing $U(1)$ Chern-Simonsgauge field. Renormalized configuration-space amplitudes for all diagramscontributing to the $\phi {}^{*} \phi {}^{*} \phi \phi$ 4-point function, whichis the only primitively divergent Green's function, are obtained up to 3-looporder. The renormalization group equations are explicitly checked, and thescheme dependence of the $\beta$-function is investigated. If therenormalization scheme is fixed to agree with a previous 1-loop calculation,the 2- and 3-loop contributions to $\beta(\lambda,e)$ vanish, and$\beta(\lambda,e)$ itself vanishes when the ``self-dual'' condition relating$\lambda$ to the gauge coupling $e$ is imposed.
