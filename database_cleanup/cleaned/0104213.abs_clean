In the five-dimensional Einstein gravity with negative cosmological constantin the presence/absence of a {\it non-fine-tuned} 3-brane, we have investigatedthe classical stability of black string solutions which are foliations offour-dimensional $AdS/dS$-Schwarzschild black holes. Such black strings aregenerically unstable as in the well-known Gregory-Laflamme instability. For$AdS$ black strings, however, it turns out that they become stable if thelongitudinal size of horizon is larger than the order of the $AdS_4$ radius.Even in the case of unstable black strings, the $AdS$ black strings have a verydifferent feature of string fragmentations from that in the flat brane world.Some implications of our results on the Gubser-Mitra conjecture are alsodiscussed.
