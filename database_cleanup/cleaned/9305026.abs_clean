Title: Closed String Field Theory

Authors: B. Zwiebach

Comments: 31 pp. MIT-CTP-2206

In these introductory notes I explain some basic ideas in string fieldindependence, the reason why minimal area metrics solve the problem ofgenerating all Riemann surfaces with vertices and propagators, and howBatalin-Vilkovisky structures arise from the state spaces of conformal fieldtheories including ghosts. More advanced topics and recent developments aresummarized. (To appear in the proceedings of the 1992 Summer School at LesHouches.)}
