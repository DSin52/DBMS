In the (non-supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory in the large N limit thereexists an infinite set of non-degenerate vacua. The distinct vacua areseparated by domain walls whose tension determines the decay rate of the falsevacua. I discuss the phenomenon from a field-theoretic point of view, startingfrom supersymmetric gluodynamics and then breaking supersymmetry, byintroducing a gluino mass. By combining previously known results, the decayrate of the excited vacua is estimated, \Gamma \sim \exp (-const \times N^4).The fourth power of N in the exponent is a consequence of the fact that thewall tension is proportional to N.
