A relativistic resonance which was defined by a pole of the $S$-matrix, or bya relativistic Breit-Wigner line shape, is represented by a generalized statevector (ket) which can be obtained by analytic extension of the relativisticLippmann-Schwinger kets. These Gamow kets span an irreducible representationspace for Poincar\'e transformations which, similar to the Wignerrepresentations for stable particles, are characterized by spin (angularmomentum of the partial wave amplitude) and complex mass (position of theresonance pole). The Poincar\'e transformations of the Gamow kets, as well asof the Lippmann-Schwinger plane wave scattering states, form only a semigroupof Poincar\'e transformations into the forward light cone. Their transformationproperties are derived. From these one obtains an unambiguous definition ofresonance mass and width for relativistic resonances. The physicalinterpretation of these transformations for the Born probabilities and theproblem of causality in relativistic quantum physics is discussed.
