Using standard field theoretical techniques, we survey pure Yang-Mills theoryon the noncommutative torus, including Feynman rules and BRS symmetry. Althoughin general free of any infrared singularity, the theory is ultravioletdivergent. Because of an invariant regularization scheme, this theory turns outto be renormalizable and the detailed computation of the one loop countertermsis given, leading to an asymptoticaly free theory. Besides, it turns out thatnon planar diagrams are overall convergent when $\theta$ is irrational.
