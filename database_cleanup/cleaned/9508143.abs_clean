An SL(2, Z) family of string solutions of type IIB supergravity in tendimensions is constructed. The solutions are labeled by a pair of relativelyprime integers, which characterize charges of the three-form field strengths.The string tensions depend on these charges in an SL(2, Z) covariant way.Compactifying on a circle and identifying with eleven-dimensional supergravitycompactified on a torus implies that the modulus of the IIB theory should beequated to the modular parameter of the torus.
