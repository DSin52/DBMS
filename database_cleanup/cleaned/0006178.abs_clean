Title: Concepts in Gauge Theory Leading to Electric--Magnetic Duality

Authors: S.T. Tsou (Oxford)

Comments: 64 pages, Latex, figures using eps; lecture notes

Gauge theory, which is the basis of all particle physics, is itself based ona few fundamental concepts, the consequences of which are often as beautiful asthey are deep. In this short lecture course I shall try to give an introductionto these concepts, both from the physical and mathematical points of view. ThenI shall show how these considerations lead to a nonabelian generalization ofthe well-known electric--magnetic duality in electromagnetism. I shall end bysketching some of the many consequences in quantum field theory that thisduality engenders in particle physics.These are notes from a lecture course given in the Summer School on {\emGeometric Methods in Quantum Field Theory}, Villa de Leyva, Colombia, July1999, as well as a series of graduate lectures given in Oxford in Trinity Termof 1999 and 2000.
