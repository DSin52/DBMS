We compute the emission spectrum of minimally coupled particles with spinthat are Hawking radiated from four dimensional black holes in string theory.For a range of the black hole parameters the result has a product structurethat may be interpreted in terms of the respective right- and left-movingthermal correlation functions of an effective string model. For spin-one andspin-two particles a novel cancellation between contributions to the wavefunction is needed to ensure this outcome. The form of the spectra suggestsparticles with spin are emitted from the right-moving sector, only.
