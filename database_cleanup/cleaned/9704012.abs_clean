The Skyrme model of nuclear physics requires quantisation if it is to matchobserved nuclear properties. A simple technique is used to find the normal modespectrum of the baryon number B=4 Skyrme soliton, representing the $\alpha$particle. We find sixteen vibrational modes and classify them under the cubicsymmetry group $O_h$ of the static solution. The spectrum possesses aremarkable structure, with the lowest energy modes lying in thoserepresentations expected from an approximate correspondence between Skyrmionsand BPS monopoles. The next mode up is the `breather', and above that arehigher multipole breathing modes.
