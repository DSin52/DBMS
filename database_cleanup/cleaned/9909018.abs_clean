We formulate the field equations for $SU(\infty)$ Einstein-Yang-Mills theory,and find spherically symmetric black-hole solutions. This model may bemotivated by string theory considerations, given the enormous gauge symmetrieswhich characterize string theory. The solutions simplify considerably in thepresence of a negative cosmological constant, particularly for the limitingcases of a very large cosmological constant or very small gauge field. Thesituation of an arbitrarily small gauge field is relevant for holography and wecomment on the AdS/CFT conjecture in this light. The black holes possessinfinite amounts of gauge field hair, and we speculate on possible consequencesof this for quantum decoherence, which, however, we do not tackle here.
