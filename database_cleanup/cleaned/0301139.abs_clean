We study compactifications of Type IIB string theory on a K3 \times T^2/Z_2orientifold in the presence of RR and NS flux. We find the most generalsupersymmetry preserving, Poincare invariant, vacua in this model. All thecomplex structure moduli and some of the Kahler moduli are stabilised in thesevacua. We obtain in an explicit fashion the restrictions imposed bysupersymmetry on the flux, and the values of the fixed moduli. Some T-duals andHeterotic duals are also discussed, these are non-Calabi-Yau spaces. Asuperpotential is constructed describing these duals. Finally, we consider somesusy breaking vacua where the flux gives rise to large extra dimensions withvanishing tree-level cosmological constant.
