The structure of S-duality in U(1) gauge theory on a 4-manifold M is examinedusing the formalism of noncommutative geometry. A noncommutative space isconstructed from the algebra of Wilson-'t Hooft line operators which encodesboth the ordinary geometry of M and its infinite-dimensional loop spacegeometry. S-duality is shown to act as an inner automorphism of the algebra andarises as a consequence of the existence of two independent Dirac operatorsassociated with the spaces of self-dual and anti-selfdual 2-forms on M. Therelations with the noncommutative geometry of string theory and T-duality arealso discussed.
