We study the cosmological evolution of a type-0 string theory by employingnon-criticality, which may be induced by fluctuations of the D3 brane worlds.We check the consistency of the approach to O(alpha ') in the correspondingsigma-model. The ten-dimensional theory is reduced to an effectivefour-dimensional model, with only time dependent fields. We show that thefour-dimensional universe has an inflationary phase and graceful exit from it,while the other extra dimensions are stabilized to a constant value, with thefifth dimension much larger than the others. We pay particular attention todemonstrating the role of tachyonic matter in inducing these features. TheUniverse asymptotes, for large times, to a non-accelerating linearly-expandingUniverse with a time-dependent dilaton and a relaxing to zero vacuum energy ala quintessence.
