We discuss an application of the method of the angular quantization toreconstruction of form-factors of local fields in massive integrable models.The general formalism is illustrated with examples of the Klein-Gordon,sinh-Gordon and Bullough-Dodd models. For the latter two models the angularquantization approach makes it possible to obtain free field representationsfor form-factors of exponential operators. We discuss an intriguing relationbetween the free field representations and deformations of the Virasoroalgebra. The deformation associated with the Bullough-Dodd models appears to bedifferent from the known deformed Virasoro algebra.
