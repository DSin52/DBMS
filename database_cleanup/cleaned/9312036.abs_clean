It is shown that the general solution of classical equations of motion in twodimensional dilaton gravity proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger(CGHS) includes a Lorentzian wormhole solution in addition to a black holesolution. We also show that matter perturbation of the wormhole by a shock waveleads to the formation of a black hole where the curvature singularity iscloaked by the global event horizon. It is also argued that the classicalwormhole would be stable against quantum corrections.
