We consider certain BPS supergravity solutions of string theory which havesingularities and we show that the singularity goes away when we add angularmomentum. These smooth solutions enable us to obtain {\it global} $AdS_3$ asthe near horizon geometry of a BPS brane system in an asymptotically flatspace.
