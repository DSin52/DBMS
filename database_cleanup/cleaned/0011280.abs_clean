The calculation of bound state properties using renormalization grouptechniques to compute the corresponding Regge trajectories is presented. Inparticular, we investigate the bound states in different charge sectors of ascalar theory with interaction (phi^dagger phi chi). The resulting bound statespectrum is surprisingly rich. Where possible we compare and contrast withknown results of the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the ladder approximation and,in the non-relativistic limit, with the corresponding Schr"odinger equation.
