M-branes are related to theories on function spaces $\cal{A}$ involvingM-linear non-commutative maps from $\cal{A} \times \cdots \times \cal{A}$ to$\cal{A}$. While the Lie-symmetry-algebra of volume preserving diffeomorphismsof $T^M$ cannot be deformed when M>2, the arising M-algebras naturally relateto Nambu's generalisation of Hamiltonian mechanics, e.g. by providing arepresentation of the canonical M-commutation relations, $[J_1,\cdots,J_M]=i\hbar$. Concerning multidimensional integrability, an importantgeneralisation of Lax-pairs is given.
