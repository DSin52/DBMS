New boundary conditions for integrable nonlinear lattices of the XXX type,such as the Heisenberg chain and the Toda lattice are presented. Theseintegrable extensions are formulated in terms of a generic XXX Heisenbergmagnet interacting with two additional spins at each end of the chain. Theconstruction uses the most general rank 1 ansatz for the 2x2 L-operatorsatisfying the reflection equation algebra with rational r-matrix. Theassociated quadratic algebra is shown to be the one of dynamical symmetry forthe A1 and BC2 Calogero-Moser problems. Other physical realizations of ourquadratic algebra are also considered.
