Title: Local Magnetization in Critical Ising Model with Boundary Magnetic Field

Authors: R.Chatterjee and A.Zamolodchikov

Comments: 8 pages, RU-93-54

We discribe a simple way to derive spin correlation functions in 2D Isingmodel at critical temperature but with nonzero magnetic field at the boundary.Local magnetization (i.e. one-point function) is computed explicitly forhalf-plane and disk geometries.
