5657-5660We show that the quantum-algebra-invariant open spin chains associated withthe affine Lie algebras $A^{(1)}_n$ for $n>1$ are integrable. The argument,which applies to a large class of other quantum-algebra-invariant chains, doesnot require that the corresponding $R$ matrix have crossing symmetry.
