We propose and canonically quantize a generalization of the two-dimensionalmassive fermion theory described by a Lagrangian containing third-orderderivatives. In our approach the mass term contains a derivative coupling. Thequantum solution is expressed in terms of three usual fermions. Employing thestandard bosonization scheme, the equivalent boson theory is derived. Theresults obtained are used to solve a theory including a current-currentinteraction.
