Title: IIA string instanton corrections to the four-fermion correlator in the

intersection of Del Pezzo surfacesAuthors: Andrei Cheshel (Kaiserslautern U.) and Sergei V. Ketov (Tokyo

The Becker-Becker-Strominger formula, describing the string world-sheetinstanton corrections to the four-fermion correlator in the Calabi-Yaucompactified type-IIA superstrings, is calculated in the special case of theCalabi-Yau threefold realized in the intersection of two Del Pezzo surfaces. Wealso derive the selection rules in the supersymmetric GUT of the Pati-Salamtype associated with our construction.
