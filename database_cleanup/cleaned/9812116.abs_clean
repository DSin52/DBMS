We consider a classical field configuration, corresponding to intersection oftwo domain walls in a supersymmetric model, where the field profile for twoparallel walls at a finite separation is known explicitly. An approximation tothe solution for intersecting walls is constructed for a small angle at theintersection. We find a finite effective length of the intersection region andalso an energy, associated with the intersection.
