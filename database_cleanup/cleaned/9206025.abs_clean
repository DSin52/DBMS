A finite-dimensional su($N$) Lie algebra equation is discussed that in theinfinite $N$ limit (giving the area preserving diffeomorphism group) tends tothe two-dimensional, inviscid vorticity equation on the torus. The equation isnumerically integrated, for various values of $N$, and the time evolution of an(interpolated) stream function is compared with that obtained from a simplemode truncation of the continuum equation. The time averaged vorticity momentsand correlation functions are compared with canonical ensemble averages.
