It has been proposed by Atiyah and Manton that the dynamics of Skyrmions maybe approximated by motion on a finite dimensional manifold obtained from themoduli space of SU(2) Yang-Mills instantons. Motivated by this work we describehow similar results exist for other soliton and instanton systems. We describein detail two examples for the approximation of the infinite dimensionaldynamics of sine-Gordon solitons by finite dimensional dynamics on a manifoldobtained from instanton moduli. In the first example we use the moduli space ofCP1 instantons and in the second example we use the moduli space of SU(2)Yang-Mills instantons. The metric and potential functions on these manifoldsare constructed and the resulting dynamics is compared with the explicit exactsoliton solutions of the sine-Gordon theory.
