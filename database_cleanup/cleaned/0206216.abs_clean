We replace our earlier condition that physical states of the superstring havenon-negative grading by the requirement that they are analytic in a new realcommuting constant t which we associate with the central charge of theunderlying Kac-Moody superalgebra. The analogy with the twisted N=2 SYM theorysuggests that our covariant superstring is a twisted version of anotherformulation with an equivariant cohomology. We prove that our vertex operatorscorrespond in one-to-one fashion to the vertex operators in Berkovits' approachbased on pure spinors. Also the zero-momentum cohomology is equal in bothcases. Finally, we apply the methods of equivariant cohomology to thesuperstring, and obtain the same BRST charge as obtained earlier by relaxingthe pure spinor constraints.
