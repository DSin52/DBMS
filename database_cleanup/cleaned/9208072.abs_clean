We study superdifferential operators of order $2n+1$ which are covariant withrespect to superconformal changes of coordinates on a compact super Riemannsurface. We show that all such operators arise from super M\"obius covariantones. A canonical matrix representation is presented and applications toclassical super W algebras are discussed.
