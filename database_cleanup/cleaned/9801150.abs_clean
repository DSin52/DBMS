We discuss the average length l of the shortest non-contractible loop onsurfaces in the two-dimensional pure quantum gravity ensemble. The value of$\gamma_{str}$ and the explicit form of the loop functions indicate that ldiverges at the critical point. Scaling arguments suggest that the criticalexponent of l is 1/2. We show that this value of the critical exponent is alsoobtained for branched polymers where the calculation is straightforward.
