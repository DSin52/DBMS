Using the representation theory of the subgroups SL_2(Z_p) of the modulargroup we investigate the induced fusion algebras in some simple examples.Only some of these representations lead to 'good' fusion algebras.Furthermore, the conformal dimensions and the central charge of thecorresponding rational conformal field theories are calculated. Two series ofrepresentations which can be realized by unitary theories are presented. Weshow that most of the fusion algebras induced by admissible representationsare realized in well known rational models.
