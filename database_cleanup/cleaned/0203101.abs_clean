There is strong evidence that the area of any surface limits the informationcontent of adjacent spacetime regions, at 10^(69) bits per square meter. Wereview the developments that have led to the recognition of this entropy bound,placing special emphasis on the quantum properties of black holes. Theconstruction of light-sheets, which associate relevant spacetime regions to anygiven surface, is discussed in detail. We explain how the bound is tested anddemonstrate its validity in a wide range of examples.A universal relation between geometry and information is thus uncovered. Ithas yet to be explained. The holographic principle asserts that its origin mustlie in the number of fundamental degrees of freedom involved in a unifieddescription of spacetime and matter. It must be manifest in an underlyingquantum theory of gravity. We survey some successes and challenges inimplementing the holographic principle.
