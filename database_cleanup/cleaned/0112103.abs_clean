The way of finding all the constraints in the Hamiltonian formulation ofsingular (in particular, gauge) theories is called the Dirac procedure. Theconstraints are naturally classified according to the correspondig stages ofthis procedure. On the other hand, it is convenient to reorganize theconstraints such that they are explicitly decomposed into the first-class andsecond-class constraints. We discuss the reorganization of the constraints intothe first- and second-class constraints that is consistent with the Diracprocedure, i.e., that does not violate the decomposition of the constraintsaccording to the stages of the Dirac procedure. The possibility of such areorganization is important for the study of gauge symmetries in the Lagrangianand Hamiltonian formulations.
