We clarify some general issues in models where gravity is localized atintermediate distances. We introduce the radion mode, which is usuallyneglected, and we point out that its role in the model is crucial. We show thatthe brane bending effects discussed in the literature can be obtained in aformalism where the physical origin is manifest. The model violates positivityof energy due to a negative tension brane, which induces a negative kineticterm for the radion. The very same effect that violates positivity isresponsible for the recovery of conventional Einstein gravity at intermediatedistances.
