We study inflation and entropy generation in a recently proposed pre-big-bangmodel universe produced in a collision of gravitational and dilaton waves. Itis shown that enough inflation occurs provided the incoming waves aresufficiently weak. We also find that entropy in this model is dynamicallygenerated as the result of the nonlinear interaction of the incoming waves,before the universe enters the phase of dilaton driven inflation. Inparticular, we give the scaling of the entropy produced in the collision interms of the focusing lengths of the incoming waves.
