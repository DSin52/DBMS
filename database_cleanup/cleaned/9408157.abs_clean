We construct a $2\times 2$ matrix algebra as representation of functions ondiscrete group $Z_2$ and develop the gauge theory on discrete group proposed byStarz in the matrix algebra. Accordingly, we show that the non-commutativegeometry model built by R.Conquereax, G.Esposito-Farese and G.Vaillant resultsfrom this approach directly.For the purpose of Physical model building, we introduce a free fermionLagrangian on $M_4\times Z_2$ and study Yang-Mills like gauge theory.
