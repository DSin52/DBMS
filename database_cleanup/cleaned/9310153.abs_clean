(In the revised version the relevant aspect of noncompactness of the moduliof instantons is discussed. It is shown nonperturbatively that any BRST trivialdeformation of A-model which does not change the ranks of BRST cohomology doesnot change the topological correlation functions either) We show that the Floercohomology and quantum cohomology rings of the almost Kahler manifold M, bothdefined over the Novikov ring of the loop space LM of M, are isomorphic. We doit using a BRST trivial deformation of the topological A-model. As an examplewe compute the Floer = quantum cohomology of the 3-dimensional flag space Fl_3.
