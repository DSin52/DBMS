The 1-loop effective potential in a scalar theory with quartic interaction onthe space $M^{4} \times T^{n}$ for $n=2$ is calculated and is shown to beunbounded from below. This is an indication of a possible instability of thevacuum of the $\lambda \phi^{4}$ theory on $M^{4}$, when it is regarded as aresult of the dimensional reduction of the original six-dimensional model. Theissue of stability for other values of the number $n$ of extra dimensions isalso discussed.
