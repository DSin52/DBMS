A new relation between two-dimensional conformal field theories andthree-dimensional topologically massive gauge theories is found, where thedynamical nature of the 3d theory is ultimately important.It is shown that the those primary states in CFT which have non-unitarydescendants correspond in the 3d theory to supercritical charges and causevacuum instability. It is also shown that logarithmic operators separating theunitary sector from a non-unitary one correspond to an exact zero energy groundstate in which case the 3d Hamiltonian naturally has a Jordan structure.
