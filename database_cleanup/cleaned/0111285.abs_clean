Twisted Eguchi-Kawai reduced chiral models are shown to be formallyequivalent to a U(1) non-commutative parent theory. The non-commutative theorydescribes the vacuum dynamics of the non-commutative charged tachyonic field ofa brane system. To make contact with the continuum non-commutative theory, adouble scaling large N limit for the reduced model is required. We show apossible limiting procedure, which we propose to investigate numerically. Ournumerical results show substantial consistency with the outlined procedure
