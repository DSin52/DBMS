We obtain a Bekenstein entropy bound for the charged objects in arbitrarydimensions ($D\ge 4$) using the D-bound recently proposed by Bousso. With thehelp of thermodynamics of CFTs corresponding to AdS Reissner-Norstr\"om (RN)black holes, we discuss the relation between the Bekenstein andBekenstein-Verlinde bounds. In particular we propose a Bekenstein-Verlinde-likebound for the charged systems. In the Einstein-Maxwell theory with a negativecosmological constant, we discuss the brane cosmology with positive tensionusing the Binetruy-Deffayet-Langlois approach. The resultingFriedman-Robertson-Walker equation can be identified with the one obtained bythe moving domain wall approach in the AdS RN black hole background. Finally wealso address the holographic property of the brane universe.
