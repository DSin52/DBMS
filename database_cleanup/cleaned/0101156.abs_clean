In the framework of causal perturbation theory we consider a massive scalarfield coupled to gravity. In the field theoretic approach to quantum gravity(QG) we start with a massless second rank tensor field. This tensor field isthen quantized in a covariant way in Minkowski space. This article deals withthe adiabatic limit for graviton radiative corrections in a scattering processof two massive scalar particles. We compute the differential cross-section forbremsstrahlung processes in which one of the outgoing particles emites agraviton of low energy, a so called soft graviton. Since the emited gravitonwill not be detected we have to integrate over all soft gravitons.
