We describe a class of supersymmetric gauged linear sigma-model, whose targetspace is the infinite dimensional space of bundles on a Calabi-Yau 3- or2-fold. This target space can be considered the configuration space of D-braneswrapped around the Calabi-Yau. We propose that this model can be used to definematrix string theory compactifications. In the infrared limit the model flowsto a superconformal non-linear sigma-model whose target space is the modulispace of BPS configurations of branes on the compact space, containing themoduli space of semi-stable bundles. We argue that the bulk degrees of freedomdecouple in the infrared limit if semi-stability implies stability. We studytopological versions of the model on Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The resulting B-modelis argued to be equivalent to the holomorphic Chern-Simons theory proposed byWitten. The A-model and half-twisted model define the quantum cohomology ringand the elliptic genus, respectively, of the moduli space of stable bundles ona Calabi-Yau 3-fold.
