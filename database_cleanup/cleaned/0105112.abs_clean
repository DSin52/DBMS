We study quasinormal modes of massless scalar and fermion fields in the nearextremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m black hole, and relate them to Choptuik scalingform following a recently proposed analytic approach. For both massless cases,quasinormal modes are shown to be proportional to the black hole horizon andthe Hawking temperature, and the critical exponents are the same, although forthe fermionic case there are two possible discrete quasinormal modes. Inaddition, the critical exponent of the massive boson is also equivalent to thatof the massless case. Finally, we discuss quasinormal modes and criticalexponents in the other models, and obtain some different critical exponentsbetween massless boson and massive one.
