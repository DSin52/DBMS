We derive the loop equations for the d-dimensional n-Hermitian matrix model.These are a consequence of the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the model. Moreoverwe show that in leading order of large $N$ the loop equations form a closedset. In particular we derive the loop equations for the $n=2^k$ matrix modelrecently proposed to describe the coupling of Two-dimensional quantum gravityto conformal matter with $c> 1$.
