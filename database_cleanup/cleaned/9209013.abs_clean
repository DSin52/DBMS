Our answer is the latter. Space-time singularities, including the initialone, are described by world-sheet topological Abelian gauge theories with aChern-Simons term. Their effective $N=2$ supersymmetry provides an initialfixed point where the Bogomolny bound is saturated on the world-sheet,corresponding to an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom solution in space-time. Awayfrom the singularity the gauge theory has world-sheet matter fields, bosons andfermions, associated with the generation of target space-time. Because thefermions are complex (cf the Quantum Hall Effect) rather than real (cfhigh-$T_c$ superconductors) the energetically-preferred vacuum is not parity ortime-reversal invariant, and the associated renormalization group flow explainsthe cosmological arrow of time, as well as the decay of real or virtual blackholes, with a monotonic increase in entropy.
