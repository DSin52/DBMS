For the case of the SU(2) WZW model at level one, the boundary states thatonly preserve the conformal symmetry are analysed. Under the assumption thatthe usual Cardy boundary states as well as their marginal deformations areconsistent, the most general conformal boundary states are determined. They arefound to be parametrised by group elements in SL(2,C).
