Theory, Institute for Nuclear Study, University of Tokyo, February 17-19,1992)Disk amplitudes of tachyons in two-dimensional open string theories(two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to $c \leq 1$ conformal fieldtheories) are obtained using the continuum Liouville field approach. Thestructure of momentum singularities is different from that of sphere amplitudesand is more complicated. It can be understood by factorizations of theamplitudes with the tachyon and the discrete states as intermediate states.
