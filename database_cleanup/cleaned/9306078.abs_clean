section "Interaction energy versus ADM energy has been rewritten"We give a general expression for the static potential energy of thegravitational interaction of two massive particles, in terms of an invariantvacuum expectation value of the quantized gravitational field. This formulaholds for functional integral formulations of euclidean quantum gravity,regularized to avoid conformal instability. It could be regarded as theanalogue of the Wilson loop for gauge theories and allows in principle, throughnumerical simulations or other approximation techniques, non perturbativeevaluations of the potential or of the effective coupling constant. Thegeometrical meaning of this expression is quite simple, as it represents the``average proper-time delay'', respect to two neighboring lines, of a very longgeodesic with unit timelike tangent vector.
