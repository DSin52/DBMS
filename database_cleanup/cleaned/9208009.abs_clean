When a Hamiltonian system is subject to constraints which depend explicitlyon time, difficulties can arise in attempting to reduce the system to itsphysical phase space. Specifically, it is non-trivial to restrict the system insuch a way that one can find a Hamiltonian time-evolution equation involvingthe Dirac bracket. Using a geometrical formulation, we derive an explicitcondition which is both necessary and sufficient for this to be possible, andwe give a formula defining the resulting Hamiltonian function. Some previousresults are recovered as special cases.
