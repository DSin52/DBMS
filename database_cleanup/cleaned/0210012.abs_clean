ActionAuthors: Ashok Das, J. Maharana, A. Melikyan

Comments: 20 pages, to appear in the proceedings of the Workshop on Integrable

Field Theories, Solitons and Duality, Sao Paulo, July 1-6, 2002In this talk, we show how the monodromy matrix, ${\hat{\cal M}}$, can beconstructed for the two dimensional tree level string effective action. Thepole structure of ${\hat{\cal M}}$ is derived using its factorizabilityproperty. It is shown that the monodromy matrix transforms non-trivially underthe non-compact T-duality group, which leaves the effective action invariantand this can be used to construct the monodromy matrix for more complicatedbackgrounds starting from simpler ones. We construct, explicitly, ${\hat{\calM}}$ for the exactly solvable Nappi-Witten model, both when B=0 and $B\neq 0$,where these ideas can be directly checked.
