The Hamiltonian treatment of constrained systems in $G\ddot{u}ler's$formalism leads us to the total differential equations in many variables. Theseequations are integrable if the corresponding system of partial differentialequations is a Jacobi system. The main aim of this paper is to investigate thequantization of the finite dimensional systems with constraints using thecanonical formalism introduced by $G\ddot{u}ler$. This approach is applied fortwo systems with constraints and the results are in agreement with thoseobtained by Dirac's canonical quatization method and path integral quantizationmethod.
