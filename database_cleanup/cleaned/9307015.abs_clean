Developing on the ideas of R. Stora and coworkers, a formulation of twodimensional field theory endowed with extended conformal symmetry is given,which is based on deformation theory of holomorphic and Hermitian spaces. Thegeometric background consists of a vector bundle $E$ over a closed surface$\Sigma$ endowed with a holomorphic structure and a Hermitian structuresubordinated to it. The symmetry group is the semidirect product of theautomorphism group ${\rm Aut}(E)$ of $E$ and the extended Weyl group ${\rmWeyl}(E)$ of $E$ and acts on the holomorphic and Hermitian structures. Theextended Weyl anomaly can be shifted into an automorphism chirally splitanomaly by adding to the action a local counterterm, as in ordinary conformalfield theory. The dependence on the scale of the metric on the fiber of $E$ isencoded in the Donaldson action, a vector bundle generalization of theLiouville action. The Weyl and automorphism anomaly split into twocontributions corresponding respectively to the determinant andprojectivization of $E$. The determinant part induces an effective ordinaryWeyl or diffeomorphism anomaly and the induced central charge can be computed.
