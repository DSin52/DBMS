The Conformal Field Theory of the current algebra of the centrally extended2-d Euclidean group is analyzed. Its representations can be written in terms offour free fields (without background charge) with signature ($-$+++). Weconstruct all irreducible representations of the current algebra with unitarybase out of the free fields and their orbifolds. This is used to investigatethe spectrum and scattering of strings moving in the background of agravitational wave. We find that all the dynamics happens in the transversespace or the longitunal one but not both.
