We consider the tensor theory on coincident E8 5-branes compactified on athree torus. Using string theory, we predict that there must be distinctcomponents in the moduli space of this theory.We argue that new superconformalfield theories are to be found in these sectors with, for example, global G2and F4 symmetries. In some cases, twisted E8 5-branes can be identified withsmall instantons in non-simply-laced gauge groups. This allows us to determinethe Higgs branch for the fixed point theory.We determine the Coulomb branch by using an M theory dual descriptioninvolving partially frozen singularities. Along the way, we show that aD0-brane binds to two D4-branes, but not to an Sp-type O4-plane (despite theexistence of a Higgs branch). These results are used to check variousstring/string dualities for which, in one case (quadruple versus NVS), wepresent a new argument. Finally, we describe the construction of new non-BPSbranes as domain walls in various heterotic/type I string theories.
