A sigma model action with N=2 D=6 superspace variables is constructed for theType II superstring compactified to six curved dimensions with Ramond-Ramondflux. The action can be quantized since the sigma model is linear when thesix-dimensional spacetime is flat. When the six-dimensional spacetime is$AdS_3\times S^3$, the action reduces to one found earlier with Vafa andWitten.
