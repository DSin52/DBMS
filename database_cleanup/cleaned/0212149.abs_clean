We analyze the decomposition of tensor products of infinite dimensionaldiscrete series (unitary) and finite-dimensional (non-unitary) representationsof SL(2,R). Although such tensor products are not in general completelyreducible, we show that the product representations become completely reducibleon the cohomology of a natural nilpotent operator Q derived from the Casimir.We introduce a definition of the character of a representation compatible withthe cohomology and use these characters to derive explicit tensor productdecomposition formulae.
