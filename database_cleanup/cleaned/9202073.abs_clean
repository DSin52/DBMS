The scattering of two excitations (both of the simplest kind) in the magneticmodel related to the $Z_n$\--Baxter model is naturally described for $n\rightarrow \infty$ in terms of the Macdonald polynomials for root system$A_1$. These polynomials play the role of zonal spherical functions for a twoparameter family of quantum symmetric spaces. These spaces ``interpolate''between various $p$\--adic and real symmetric spaces.
