Authors: V.P.Maslov and O.Yu.Shvedov

Comments: 5 pages, LaTeX, no figures, talk presented at the International

Conference "Problems of Quantum Field Theory - 98", Dubna, Russia, July13-17, 1998Large-N field systems are considered from an unusual point of view. TheHamiltonian is presented in a third-quantized form analogously to thesecond-quantized formulation of the quantum theory of many particles. Thesemiclassical approximation is applied to the third-quantized Hamiltonian. Theadvantages of this approach in comparison with 1/N-expansion are discussed.
