Title: Noncommutative differential geometry with higher order derivatives

Comments: 10 pages

Journal-ref: Lett.Math.Phys. 32 (1994) 357-364

We build a toy model of differential geometry on the real line, whichincludes derivatives of the second order. Such construction is possible onlywithin the framework of noncommutative geometry. We introduce the metric andbriefly discuss two simple physical models of scalar field theory and gaugetheory in this geometry.
