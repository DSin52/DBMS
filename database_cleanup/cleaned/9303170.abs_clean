The picture of S-wave scatering from a 4D extremal dilatonic black hole isexamined. Classically, a small matter shock wave will form a non-extremal blackhole. In the "throat region" the r-t geometry is exactly that of a collapsing2D black hole. The 4D Hawking radiation (in this classical background) givesthe 2D Hawking radiation exactly in the throat region. Inclusion of the2D one only if the Hawking radiation is very small and only at the beginning ofthe radiation. We give that 4D solution. When the total radiating energyapproaches the energy carried by the shock wave, the 4D picture breaks down.This happens even before an apparent horizon is formed, which suggests that the4D semi-classical solution is quite different from the 2D one.
