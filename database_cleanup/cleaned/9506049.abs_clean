Title: New Insight into the Relation between Torsion and Electromagnetism

Comments: Report number corrected, 6 pages, uses LaTeX

In several unified field theories the torsion trace is set equal to theelectromagnetic potential. Using fibre bundle techniques we show that this isno leading principle but a formal consequence of another geometric relationbetween space-time and electromagentism.
