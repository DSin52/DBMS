We review and elaborate on properties of the string tension intwo-dimensional gauge theories. The first model we consider is massive QED inthe $m\ll e$ limit. We evaluate the leading string tension both in thefermionic and bosonized descriptions. We discuss the next to leadingcorrections in $m/e$. The next-to-leading terms in the long distance behaviorof the quark-antiquark potential, are evaluated in a certain region of externalversus dynamical charges. The finite temperature behavior is also determined.In $QCD_2$ we review the results for the string tension of quarks in cases withdynamical quarks in the fundamental, adjoint, symmetric and antisymmetricrepresentations. The screening nature of $SYM_2$ is re-derived.
