We calculate the 1-loop effective potential in a supersymmetric model in 5Dwith $S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2)$ orbifold compactification. The procedure ofcalculation consists of evaluating first the integrals over four-momenta usingthe dimensional regularization and then the sum over Kaluza-Klein modes usingthe zeta-regularization. We show that both fermionic and bosonic contributionsare separately finite and argue that, supersymmetry is not necessary for thefiniteness of the theory at 1-loop. Also, some general arguments on thefiniteness of the theory with arbitrary number of extra dimensions arepresented.
