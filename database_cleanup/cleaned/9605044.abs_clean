Using stochastic quantization method we derive gauge-invariant equations,connecting multilocal vacuum correlators of nonperturbative fieldconfigurations immersed into the quantum background. Three alternative methodsof stochastic regularization of these equations are suggested, and thecorresponding regularized propagators of a background field are obtained in thelowest order of perturbation theory.
