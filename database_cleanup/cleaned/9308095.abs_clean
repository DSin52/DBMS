In two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories, there may exist a global Weylinvariance which makes black hole spurious. If the global invariance and thelocal Weyl invariance of the matter coupling are intact at the quantum level,there is no Hawking radiation. We explicitly verify the absence of anomalies inthese symmetries for the model proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harvey andStrominger. The crucial observation is that the conformal anomaly can becohomologically trivial and so not truly anomalous in such dilaton gravitymodels.
