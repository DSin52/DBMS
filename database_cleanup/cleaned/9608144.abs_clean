By using the path integral method , we calculate the Green functions of fieldstrength of Yang-Mills theories on arbitrary nonorientable surfaces inSchwinger-Fock gauge. We show that the non-gauge invariant correlators consistof a free part and an almost $x$-independent part. We also show that the gaugeinvariant $n$-point functions are those corresponding to the free part , as inthe case of orientable surfaces.
