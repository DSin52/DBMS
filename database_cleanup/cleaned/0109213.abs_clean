Two ways in which de Sitter space can arise in supergravity theories arediscussed. In the first, it arises as a solution of a conventionalsupergravity, in which case it necessarily has no Killing spinors. For example,de Sitter space can arise as a solution of N=8 gauged supergravities in four orfive dimensions. These lift to solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity or D=10IIB supergravity which are warped products of de Sitter space and non-compactspaces of negative curvature. In the second way, de Sitter space can arise as asupersymmetric solution of an unconventional supergravity theory, whichtypically has some kinetic terms with the `wrong' sign; such solutions areinvariant under a de Sitter supergroup. Such solutions lift to supersymmetricsolutions of unconventional supergravities in D=10 or D=11, which nonethelessarise as field theory limits of theories that can be obtained from M-theory bytimelike T-dualities and related dualities. Brane solutions interpolate betweenthese solutions and flat space and lead to a holographic duality betweentheories in de Sitter vacua and Euclidean conformal field theories. Previousresults are reviewed and generalised, and discussion is included ofKaluza-Klein theory with non-compact internal spaces, brane and cosmologicalsolutions, and holography on de Sitter spaces and product spaces.
