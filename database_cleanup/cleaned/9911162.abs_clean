Generalized Yang-Mills theories have a covariant derivative that employs bothscalar and vector bosons. Here we show how grand unified theories of theelectroweak and strong interactions can be constructed with them. In particularthe SU(5) GUT can be obtained from SU(6) with SU(5)xU(1) as a maximal subgroup.The choice of maximal subgroup also determines the chiral structure of thetheory. The resulting Lagrangian has only two terms, and only two irreduciblerepresentations are needed, one for fermions and another for bosons.
