We argue that a system of interacting D-branes, generalizing a recentproposal, can be modelled as a Quantum Hall fluid. We show that tachyoncondensation in such a system is equivalent to one particle tunnelling. In aconformal field theory effective description, that induces a transition from atheory with central charge c=2 to a theory with c=3/2, with a correspondingsymmetry enhancement.
