In this paper, two things are done. (i) First, it is shown that any globalsymmetry of a gauge-invariant theory can be extended to the ghosts and theantifields so as to leave invariant the solution of the master-equation (beforegauge fixing). (ii) Second, it is proved that the incorporation of the rigidsymmetries to the solution of the master-equation through the introduction of aconstant ghost for each global symmetry can be obstructed already at theclassical level whenever the theory possesses higher order conservation laws.Explicit examples are given.
