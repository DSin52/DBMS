We propose the lattice version of $BF$ gravity action whose partitionfunction leads to the product of a particular form of 15-$j$ symbol whichcorresponds to a 4-simplex. The action is explicitly constructed by lattice $B$field defined on triangles and link variables defined on dual links and isshown to be invariant under lattice local Lorentz transformation andKalb-Ramond gauge transformation. We explicitly show that the partitionfunction is Pachner move invariant and thus topological. The action includesthe vanishing holonomy constraint which can be interpreted as a gauge fixingcondition. This formulation of lattice $BF$ theory can be generalized intoarbitrary dimensions.
