It has long been argued that the continuum limit of the 3D Ising model isequivalent to a string theory. Unfortunately, in the usual starting point forthis equivalence -- a certain lattice theory of surfaces -- it is not at allobvious how to take the continuum limit. In this note, I reformulate thelattice theory of surfaces in a fashion such that the continuum limit isstraightforward. I go on to discuss how this new formulation may overcome somefundamental objections to the notion that the Ising model is equivalent to astring theory. In an appendix, I also discuss some aspects of fermion doubling,and the lattice fermion formulation of the 2D Ising model.
