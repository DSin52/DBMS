honor of Marc Henneaux, October 2001, BrusselsNature's attraction to unique mathematical structures provides powerful hintsfor unraveling her mysteries. None is at present as intriguing aseleven-dimensional M-theory. The search for exceptional structures specific toeleven dimensions leads us to exceptional groups in the description ofspace-time. One specific connection, through the coset $F_4/SO(9)$, may providea generalization of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Since this coset happensto be the projective space of the Exceptional Jordan Algebra, its charge spacemay be linked to the fundamental degrees of freedom underlying M-theory.
