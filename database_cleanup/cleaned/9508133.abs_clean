Authors: Yuji Yamada

Comments: 43 pages, latex, 11 figures

We obtain the Bethe Ansatz equations for the broken ${\bf Z}_{N}$-symmetricmodel by constructing a functional relation of the transfer matrix of$L$-operators. This model is an elliptic off-critical extension of theFateev-Zamolodchikov model. We calculate the free energy of this model on thebasis of the string hypothesis.
