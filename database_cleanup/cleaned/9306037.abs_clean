We derive loop equations for the one-link correlators of gauge and scalarfields in the Kazakov-Migdal model. These equations determine the solution ofthe model in the large N limit and are similar to analogous equations for theHermitean two-matrix model. We give an explicit solution of the equations forthe case of a Gaussian, quadratic potential. We also show how similarcalculations in a non-Gaussian case reduce to purely algebraic equations.
