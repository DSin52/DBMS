We calculate the prepotential of the low-energy effective action for $N=2$$SU(2)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with $N_f$ massless hypermultiplets($N_f=1,\, 2,\, 3$). The precise evaluation of the instanton corrections isperformed by making use of the Picard-Fuchs equations associated with ellipticcurves. The flavor dependence of the instanton effect is determined explicitlyboth in the weak- and strong-coupling regimes.
