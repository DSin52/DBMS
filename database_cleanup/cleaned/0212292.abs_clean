Rev. DWe define and compute the energy of higher curvature gravity theories inarbitrary dimensions. Generically, these theories admit constant curvaturevacua (even in the absence of an explicit cosmological constant), andasymptotically constant curvature solutions with non-trivial energy properties.For concreteness, we study quadratic curvature models in detail. Among them,the one whose action is the square of the traceless Ricci tensor always haszero energy, unlike conformal (Weyl) gravity. We also study the string-inspiredEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet model and show that both its flat and Anti-de-Sittervacua are stable.
