Classical W-algebras in higher dimensions have been recently constructed. Inthis letter we show that there is a finitely generated subalgebra which isisomorphic to the algebra of local diffeomorphisms in D dimensions. Moreover,there is a tower of infinitely many fields transforming under this subalgebraas symmetric tensorial one-densities. We also unravel a structure isomorphic tothe Schouten symmetric bracket, providing a natural generalization of w_\inftyin higher dimensions.
