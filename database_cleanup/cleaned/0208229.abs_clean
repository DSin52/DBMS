throughout the text and improved discussion of the issue of unitarity of theboundary theory. Final version to appear in Phys. Rev. DWe compute the boundary two point functions of operators corresponding tomassive spin 1 and spin 2 de Sitter fields, by an extension of the ``S-Matrix''approach developed for bulk scalars. In each case the two point functions areof the form required for conformal invariance of the dual boundary fieldtheory. We emphasise that in the context of dS/CFT one should consider unitaryrepresentations of the Euclidean conformal group, without reference to analyticcontinuation of the boundary theory to Lorentzian signature.
