We reconsider the four dimensional extremal black hole constructed in typeIIB string theory as the bound state of D1-branes, D5-branes, momentum, andKaluza-Klein monopoles. Specifically, we examine the case of an arbitrarynumber of monopoles. Consequently, the weak coupling calculation of themicroscopic entropy requires a study of the D1-D5 system on an ALE space. Wefind that the complete expression for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy isobtained by taking into account the massless open strings stretched between thefractional D-branes which arise in the orbifold limit of the ALE space. Theblack hole sector therefore arises as a mixed Higgs-Coulomb branch of aneffective 1+1 dimensional gauge theory.
