Starting from the primal principle based on the noncommutative nature of(9+1)-dimensional spacetime, we construct a topologically twisted version ofthe supersymmetric reduced model with a certain modification. Our formulationautomatically provides extra 1+1 dimensions, thereby the dimensions ofspacetime are promoted to 10+2. With a suitable gauge choice, we can reduce themodel with (10+2)-dimensional spacetime to the one with (9+1)-dimensions andthus we regard this gauge as the light-cone gauge. It is suggested that themodel so obtained would describe the light-cone F-theory. From this viewpointwe argue the relation of the reduced model to the matrix model of M-theory andthe SL(2,Z) symmetry of type IIB string theory. We also discuss the generalcovariance of the matrix model in a broken phase, and make some comments on thebackground independence.
