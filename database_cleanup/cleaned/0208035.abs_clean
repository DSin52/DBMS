Title: On inert properties of particles in classical theory

Comments: LaTeX 2.09, 37 pages; submitted to Phys. Part. Nucl

This is a critical review of inert properties of classical relativistic pointobjects. The objects are classified as Galilean and non-Galilean. Three typesIn the absence of external forces, such particles are capable of executing notonly uniform motions along straight lines but also Zitterbewegungs,self-accelerations, self-decelerations, and uniformly accelerated motions. Afree non-Galilean object possesses the four-velocity and the four-momentumwhich are in general not collinear, therefore, its inert properties arespecified by two, rather than one, invariant quantities. It is shown that aspinning particle need not be a non-Galilean object. The necessity of a rigidmechanics for the construction of a consistent classical electrodynamics inspacetimes of dimension D+1 is justified for D+1>4. The problem of how much theform of fundamental laws of physics orders four dimensions of our world isrevised together with its solution suggested by Ehrenfest. The present analysismade it apparent that the notion of the ``back-reaction'' does not reflect theheart of the matter in classical field theories with point-like sources, thenotion of ``dressed'' particles proves more appropriate.
