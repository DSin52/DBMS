The area formula for entropy is extended to the case of a dilatonic blackhole. The entropy of a scalar field in the background of such a black hole iscalculated semiclassically. The area and cutoff dependences are normal {\itexcept in the extremal case}, where the area is zero but the entropy nonzero.
