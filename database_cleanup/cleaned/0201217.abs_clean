We study the possible quantum anomaly for the transverse Ward-Takahashirelations in four dimensional gauge theories based on the method of computingthe axial-vector and the vector current operator equations. In addition to thewell-known anomalous axial-vector divergence equation (the Adler-Bell-Jackiwanomaly), we find the anomalous axial-vector curl equation, which leads to thequantum anomaly of the transverse Ward-Takahashi relation for the axial-vectorvertex. The computation shows that there is no anomaly for the transverseWard-Takahashi relation for the vector vertex.
