Bulk matter modes of higher dimensional models generically become unstable inthe presence of additional matter multiplets at the branes. This quantuminstability is driven by localized Fayet-Iliopoulos terms that attract the bulkzero modes towards the boundary branes. We study this mechanism in theframework of a 5 dimensional S^1/Z_2 orbifold and give conditions for thevarious possibilities of localization of (chiral) zero modes. This mechanism isquite relevant for realistic model building, as the standard model containsU(1) hypercharge with potentially localized FI-terms. The analysis is closelyrelated to localized anomalies in higher dimensional gauge theories. Fivedimensional gauge invariance of the effective action determines the anomalyconstraints and fixes the normalization of Chern-Simons terms. The localizationof the bulk modes does not effect the anomaly cancellation globally, but theadditional heavy Kaluza-Klein modes of the bulk fields may cancel theChern-Simons terms. We discuss also the potential appearance of the parityanomaly that might render the construction of some orbifold modelsinconsistent.
