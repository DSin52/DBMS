We propose a twistor--like formulation of N=1, D=3,4,6 and 10 nullsuperstrings. The model possesses N=1 target space supersymmetry and n=D-2local worldsheet supersymmetry, the latter replaces the kappa-symmetry of theconventional approach to the strings. Adding a Wess--Zumino term to a nullinduced worldsheet metric becomes non-degenerate and the resulting model turnsout to be classically equivalent to the heterotic string.
