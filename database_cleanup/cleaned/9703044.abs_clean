We find exactly solvable dilaton gravity theories containing a U(1) gaugefield in two dimensional space-time. The classical general solutions for thegravity sector (the metric plus the dilaton field) of the theories coupled to amassless complex scalar field are obtained in terms of the stress-energy tensorand the U(1) current of the scalar field. We discuss issues that arise when weattempt to use these models for the study of the gravitational back-reaction.
