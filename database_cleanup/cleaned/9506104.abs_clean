We present a construction of modular invariant partition functions forheterotic (0,2) supersymmetric classical string vacua. This generalization ofGepner's construction yields GUT gauge groups E_6, SO(10), SU(5) and SU(3) xSU(2) x U(1)^r, respectively. By calculating the massless spectrum of some ofthese models we find strong indications that they correspond to (0,2) stringvacua discussed recently in the context of CYM/LG phases.
