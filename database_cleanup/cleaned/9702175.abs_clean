It was found in the two-dimensional quantum gravity both in the de Dondergauge and in the lightcone gauge that one of field equations breaks down at thelevel of the representation, though the breakdown is very little. It is shownthat this anomalous behavior occurs also in a very simple model analogous tothe lightcone-gauge two-dimensional quantum gravity. This model, however, canbe transformed into a free field theory by a nonsingular transformation. Ofcourse, the latter has no anomaly. The cause of the discrepancy is analyzed.
