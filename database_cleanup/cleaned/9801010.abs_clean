We construct topological recursion relations (TRR's) at higher genera $g\ge2$for general 2-dimensional topological field theories coupled to gravity. TheseTRR's when combined with Virasoro conditions enable one to determine the numberof higher genus holomorphic curves in any Fano varieties. In the case of $CP^2$we reproduce the known results at genus $g=2$.
