Berkovits and Vafa recently showed that critical string theories can beconsidered as critical superstring theories with a special choice ofbackground. The embedding of the Virasoro algebra into the super-Virasoroalgebra involved in this construction has been extended to the noncritical caseby Berkovits and Ohta. It is shown that the resulting nonlinear realization ofthe super-Virasoro algebra can be interpreted using standard techniques fromthe theory of nonlinear realizations. This extends earlier work of Kunitomo.
