We analyze the anti-de Sitter (AdS) superparticle and superstring systemsdescribed in terms of supermatrix valued coordinates proposed by Roiban andSiegel. This approach gives simple symmetry transformations and equations ofmotion. We examine their kappa-transformations, infinite reducibility andkappa-gauge fixing conditions. A closed first class constraint set for the AdSsuperparticle is GL(4|4) covariant and keeping superconformal symmetrymanifestly. For the AdS superstring $\sigma$-dependence breaks the GL(4|4)covariance, where supercovariant derivatives and currents satisfy theinhomogeneous GL(4|4). A closed first class constraint set for the AdSsuperstring turns out to be the same as the one for a superstring in flatspace, namely ABCD constraints.
