We show that weak-coupled two-dimensional dilaton gravity on Anti-de Sitterspace can be described by the dynamics of an open string. Neumann and Dirichletboundary conditions for the string lead to two different realizations of theAnti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory correspondence. In particular, in theDirichlet case the thermodynamical entropy of two-dimensional black holes canbe exactly reproduced by counting the string states.
