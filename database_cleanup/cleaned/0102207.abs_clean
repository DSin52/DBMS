We construct an intersecting brane configuration in six-dimensional spacewith one extra space-like and one extra time-like dimensions. With a certainadditional symmetry imposed on the extra space-time we have found thateffective four-dimensional cosmological constant vanishes automatically,providing the static solution with gravity fully localized at the intersectionregion as there are no propagating massive modes of graviton. In this way, thesame symmetry allows us to eliminate tachyonic states of graviton from thespectrum of the effective four-dimensional theory, thus avoidingphenomenological difficulties comming from the matter instability usuallyinduced in theories with extra time-like dimensions.
