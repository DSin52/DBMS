The absorption cross section for scattering of fermions off an extreme BTZblack hole is calculated. It is shown that, as in the case of scalar particles,an extreme BTZ black hole exhibits an absorption cross section equals to zero,what is consistent with the vanishing entropy of such object. We also show thatthe Dirac equation, in this background, can be solved completely for a veryspecial case where the energy of the incident wave and the azimuthal eigenvaluemust satisfy a {\it fine tuning condition}. Additionally, we give a generalargument to prove that the particle flux near the horizon is zero, no matterhow they are constructed. Finally we show that the {\it reciprocal space},introduced in a previous work, gives rise to the same result and, therefore, itcould be considered as the space where the scattering process take place in aAdS spacetime.
