Title: A Noncommutative Version of the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation

Authors: Aristophanes Dimakis and Folkert Muller-Hoissen

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX using amssymb.sty

We apply a (Moyal) deformation quantization to a bicomplex associated withthe classical nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This induces a deformation of thelatter equation to noncommutative space-time while preserving the existence ofan infinite set of conserved quantities.
