We propose a new approach for using the AdS/CFT correspondence to studyquantum black hole physics. The black holes on a brane in an AdS$_{D+1}$braneworld that solve the classical bulk equations are interpreted as duals of{\it quantum-corrected} $D$-dimensional black holes, rather than classicalones, of a conformal field theory coupled to gravity. We check this explicitlyin D=3 and D=4. In D=3 we reinterpret the existing exact solutions on a flatmembrane as states of the dual 2+1 CFT. We show that states with a sufficientlylarge mass really are 2+1 black holes where the quantum corrections dress theclassical conical singularity with a horizon and censor it from the outside. Ona negatively curved membrane, we reinterpret the classical bulk solutions asquantum-corrected BTZ black holes. In D=4 we argue that the bulk solution forthe brane black hole should include a radiation component in order to describea quantum-corrected black hole in the 3+1 dual. Hawking radiation of theconformal field is then dual to classical gravitational bremsstrahlung in theAdS$_5$ bulk.
