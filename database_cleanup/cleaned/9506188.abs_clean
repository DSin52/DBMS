corection in the tex source to include properly figIn this first paper we begin the application of variational methods torenormalisable asymptotically free field theories, using the Gross-Neveu modelas a laboratory. This variational method has been shown to lead to anumerically convergent sequence of approximations for the anharmonicoscillator. Here we perform a sample calculation in lowest orders, which showsthe superficially disastrous situation of variational calculations in quantumfield theory, and how in the large-$N$ limit all difficulties go away, as awarm up exercise for the finite-$N$ case and for QCD.
