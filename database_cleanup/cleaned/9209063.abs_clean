We compute the low-energy classical differential scattering cross-section forBPS $SU(2)$ magnetic monopoles using the geodesic approximation to the actualdynamics and 16K parallel processors on a CM2. Numerical experiments suggestthat the quantum BPS magnetic monopole differential cross-section iswell-approximated by the classical BPS magnetic monopole differentialcross-section. In particular, the expected quantum interference effects forbosons at scattering angle $\theta=\pi/2$ (CoM frame) are contradictednumerically. We argue that this is due to the topology of the classicalconfiguration space for these solitons. We also study the scattering andbounded classical motions of BPS dyons and their global structure in phasespace by constructing `escape plots'. The escape plots contain a surprisingamount of structure, and suggest that the classical dynamics of two BPS $SU(2)$magnetic monopoles is chaotic and that there are closed and bounded two dyonmotions with isolated energies.
