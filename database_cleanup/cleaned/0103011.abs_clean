We study the BPS domain walls of supersymmetric Yang-Mills for arbitrarygauge group. We describe the degeneracies of domain walls interpolating betweenarbitrary pairs of vacua. A recently proposed large N duality sheds light onvarious aspects of such domain walls. In particular, for the case of G = SU(N)the domain walls correspond to wrapped D-branes giving rise to a 2+1dimensional U(k) gauge theory on the domain wall with a Chern-Simons term oflevel N. This leads to a counting of BPS degeneracies of domain walls inagreement with expected results.
