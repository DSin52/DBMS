We review the emergence of the ten-dimensional fermionic closed stringtheories from subspaces of the Hilbert space of the 26-dimensional bosonicclosed string theory compactified on an $E_8\times SO(16)$ lattice. They arisefrom a consistent truncation procedure which generates space-time fermions outof bosons. This procedure is extended to open string sectors. We prove thattruncation of the unique tadpole-free $SO(2^{13})$ bosonic string theorycompactified on the above lattice determines the anomaly free Chan-Paton groupof the Type I theory and the consistent Chan-Paton groups of Type O theories.It also predicts the tension of space-filling D-branes in these fermionictheories. The derivation of these fermionic string properties from bosonicconsiderations alone points towards a dynamical origin of the truncationprocess. Space-time fermions and supersymmetries would then arise from bosonicdegrees of freedom and no fermionic degrees of freedom would be needed in afundamental theory of quantum gravity.
