The order-disorder duality structure is exploited in order to obtain aAbelian Higgs Model; c) the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory; d) theMaxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs theory. A careful construction of a charge bearingorder operator($\sigma$) and a magnetic flux bearing disorder operator (vortexoperator) ($\mu$) is performed, paying attention to the necessary requirementsfor locality. An anyon operator is obtained as the product $\varphi=\sigma\mu$.A detailed and comprehensive study of the euclidean correlation functions of$\sigma$, $\mu$ and $\varphi$ is carried on in the four theories above. Theexact correlation functions are obtained in cases $\underline{a}$ and$\underline{c}$. The large distance behavior of them is obtained in cases$\underline{b}$ and $\underline{d}$. The study of these correlation functionsallows one to draw conclusions about the condensation of charge and magneticflux, establishing thereby an analogy with the Ising model. The mass of vortexand anyon excitations is explicitly obtained wherever these excitations arepresent in the spectrum. The independence between the mechanisms of massgeneration for the vortices and for the vector field is clearly exposed.
