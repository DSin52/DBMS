Title: Soliton on Noncommutative Orbifold $ T^2/Z_k $

Comments: 13 pages, no figures

Following the construction of the projection operators on $ T^2 $ presentedby Gopakumar, Headrick and Spradin, we construct the projection operators onthe integral noncommutative orbifold $ T^2/G (G=Z_k,k=2, 3, 4, 6)$. Suchoperators are expressed by a function on this orbifold. So it provides acomplete set of projection operators upon the moduli space $T^2 \times K/Z_k$.All these operators has the same trace 1/A ($A$ is an integer). Since theprojection operators correspond to solitons in noncommutative string fieldtheory, we obtained the explicit expression of all the soliton solutions on $T^2/Z_k $.
