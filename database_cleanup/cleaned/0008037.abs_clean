Title: Coarse graining and renormalization

Comments: 4 pages, RevTex, no figure

Formulating the QFT's as coarse grained 'low' energy sectors of a postulatedcomplete quantum theory of everything with the 'high' energy modes integratedout or 'clustering' into 'low' energy objects, we can evaluate the Feynmanamplitudes by solving a series of natural differential equations whichautomatically dissolves the necessity of infinity subtraction and theassociated subtleties. This new strategy has direct implications to the schemedependence problem.
