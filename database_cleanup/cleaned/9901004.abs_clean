We provide evidence for the validity of AdS/CFT correspondence in the Coulombbranch by comparing the Yang-Mills effective action with the potential betweenwaves on two separated test 3-branes in the presence of a large number of other3-branes. For constant gauge fields excited on the branes, this requires thatthe supergravity potential in a $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background is the {\it same}as that in flat space, despite the fact that both propagators and couplings ofsome relevant supergravity modes are different. We show that this is indeedtrue, due to a subtle cancellation. With time-dependent gauge fields on thetest branes, the potential is sensitive to retardation effects of causalpropagation in the bulk. We argue that this is reflected in higher derivative(acceleration) terms in the Yang-Mills effective action. We show that for two3-branes separated in flat space the structure of lowest order accelerationterms is in agreement with supergravity expectations.
