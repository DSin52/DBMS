Based upon the intrinsic relation between the divergent lower point functionsand the convergent higher point ones in the renormalizable quantum fieldtheories, we propose a new method for regularization and renormalization inQFT. As an example, we renormalize the $\phi^{4}$ theory at the one loop orderby means of this method.
