We combine linear response theory and dimensional regularization in order toderive the dynamical Casimir force in the low frequency regime. We consider twoparallel plates moving along the normal direction in $D-$dimensional space. Weassume the free-space values for the mass of each plate to be known, and obtainfinite, separation-dependent mass corrections resulting from the combinedeffect of the two plates. The global mass correction is proportional to thestatic Casimir energy, in agreement with Einstein's law of equivalence betweenmass and energy for stressed rigid bodies.
