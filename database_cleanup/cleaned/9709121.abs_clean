Title: Chiral Interactions of Massive Particles in the (1/2,0)+(0,1/2)

RepresentationComments: CRCKAPB.STY used, 7pp. Presented at the Second Vigier Symposium,

August 25-29, 1997, York University, Toronto, CanadaJournal-ref: Causality and Locality in Modern Physics -- Proceedings of a

Symposium in honour of Jean-Pierre Vigier (Eds. G. Hunter, S. Jeffers, J.-P.Vigier), Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, pp. 269-276On the basis of the first principles we argue that self/anti-self chargeconjugate states of the (1/2,0)+(0,1/2) representation can possess the axialcharge. Finally, we briefly discuss recent claims of the \sim \vec \sigma \cdot[ \vec A \times \vec A^\ast ] interaction term for the particles of thisrepresentation.
