Title: The Verlinde Algebra And The Cohomology Of The Grassmannian

Authors: Edward Witten

Comments: 78 pages

The article is devoted to a quantum field theory explanation of therelationship (noticed some years ago by Gepner) between the Verlinde algebra ofthe group $U(k)$ at level $N-k$ and the cohomology of the Grassmannian. Theargument proceeds by starting with the two dimensional sigma model whose targetspace is the Grassmannian and integrating out some fields in a standard way. Ithas long been known that the resulting low energy effective action describes atheory with a mass gap; the novelty here is that this theory in fact isequivalent at long distances to a gauged WZW model of $U(k)/U(k)$, and hence isrelated to the Verlinde algebra.
