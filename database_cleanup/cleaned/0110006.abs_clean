Regularization of quantum field theories (QFT's) can be achieved byquantizing the underlying manifold (spacetime or spatial slice) therebyreplacing it by a non-commutative matrix model or a ``fuzzy manifold'' . Suchdiscretization by quantization is remarkably successful in preservingsymmetries and topological features, and altogether overcoming thefermion-doubling problem . In this thesis, the fuzzification of coadjointorbits and their QFT's are put forward.
