The Hamiltonian theory of zero-curvature equations with spectral parameter onan arbitrary compact Riemann surface is constructed. It is shown that theequations can be seen as commuting flows of an infinite-dimensional fieldgeneralization of the Hitchin system. The field analog of the ellipticCalogero-Moser system is proposed. An explicit parameterization of Hitchinsystem based on the Tyurin parameters for stable holomorphic vector bundles onalgebraic curves is obtained.
