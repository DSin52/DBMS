In this paper the linear representations of analytic Moufang loops areinvestigated. We prove that every representation of semisimple analytic Moufangloop is completely reducible and find all nonassociative irreduciblerepresentations. We show that such representations are closely associated withthe (anti-)self-dual Yang-Mills equations in ${\bf R}^8$
