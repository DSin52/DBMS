We consider a deformation of the BF theory in any dimension by means of theantifield BRST formalism. Possible consistent interaction terms for the actionand the gauge symmetries are analyzed and we find a new class of topologicalgauge theories. Deformations of the world volume BF theory are considered aspossible deformations of the topological open membrane. Therefore if weconsider these theories on open membranes, we obtain noncommutative structuresof the boundaries of open membranes, and we propose a generalization of thepath integral representation of the star deformation.
