Studies of first-order phase transitions through the use of the exactrenormalization group are reviewed. In the first part the emphasis is onfirst-order phase transitions for a three-dimensional model of two coupledscalar fields -- the cubic anisotropy model. In the second part we review theapplication of the exact renormalization group to the calculation ofbubble-nucleation rates. More specifically, we concentrate on thepre-exponential factor. We discuss the reliability of homogeneous nucleationtheory that employs a saddle-point expansion around the critical bubble for thecalculation of the nucleation rate.
