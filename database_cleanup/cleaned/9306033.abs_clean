To any non-trivial embedding of sl(2) in a (super) Lie algebra, one canassociate an extension of the Virasoro algebra. We realize the extendedVirasoro algebra in terms of a WZW model in which a chiral, solvable group isgauged, the gauge group being determined by the sl(2) embedding. The resultingBRST cohomology is computed and the field content of the extended Virasoroalgebra is determined. The (quantum) closure of the extended Virasoro algebrais shown. Applications such as the quantum Miura transformation and theeffective action of the associated extended gravity theory are discussed indetail.
