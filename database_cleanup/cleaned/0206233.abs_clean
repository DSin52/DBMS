Title: Higher Symmetries of the Laplacian

Authors: Michael Eastwood

Comments: 20 pages

Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we identify the symmetry algebra of theLaplacian on Euclidean space as an explicit quotient of the universalenveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of conformal motions. We constructanalogues of these symmetries on a general conformal manifold.
