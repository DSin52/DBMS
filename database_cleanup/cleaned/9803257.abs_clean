We discuss the relationship between two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravitymodels and sine-Gordon-like field theories. We show that there is a one-to-onecorrespondence between the solutions of 2D dilaton gravity and the solutions ofa (two fields) generalization of the sine-Gordon model. In particular, we finda connection between the soliton solutions of the generalized sine-Gordon modeland extremal black hole solutions of 2D dilaton gravity. As a by-product of ourcalculations we find a easy way to generate cosmological solutions of 2Ddilaton gravity.
