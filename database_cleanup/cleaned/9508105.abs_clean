It is shown that a WZW model corresponding to a general simple grouppossesses in general different quantisations which are parametrised by$Hom(\pi_1(G),Hom(\pi_1(G),U(1)))$. The quantum theories are genericallyneither monodromy nor modular invariant, but all the modular invariant theoriesof Felder et.al. are contained among them.A formula for the transformation of the Sugawara expression for $L_0$ underconjugation with respect to non-contractible loops in $LG$ is derived. Thisformula is then used to analyse the monodromy properties of the variousquantisations. It turns out that for $\pi_1(G)\cong \Zop_N$, with $N$ even,there are $2$ monodromy invariant theories, one of which is modular invariant,and for $\pi_1(G)\cong \Zop_2\times\Zop_2$ there are $8$ monodromy invarianttheories, two of which are modular invariant. A few specific examples areworked out in detail to illustrate the results.
