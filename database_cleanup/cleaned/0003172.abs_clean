The gravitational anomalies in two dimensions, specifically the Einsteinanomaly and the Weyl anomaly, are fully determined by means of dispersionrelations. In this approach the anomalies originate from the peculiar infraredfeature of the imaginary part of the relevant formfactor which approaches a$\delta$-function singularity at zero momentum squared when $m \to 0$.
