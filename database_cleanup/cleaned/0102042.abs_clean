We consider a brane-universe in the background of an Anti-de Sitter/Schwarschild geometry. We show that the induced geometry of the brane isexactly given by that of a standard radiation dominated FRW-universe. Theradiation is represented by a strongly coupled CFT with an AdS-dualdescription. We show that when the brane crosses the horizon of the AdS-blackhole the entropy and temperature are simply expressed in the Hubble constantand its time derivative. We present formulas for the entropy of the CFT whichare generally valid, and which at the horizon coincide with the FRW equations.These results shed new light on recently proposed entropy bounds in the contextof cosmology.
