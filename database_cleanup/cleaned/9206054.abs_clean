We compute correlation functions in $N=2$ non critical superstrings on thesphere. Our calculations are restrained to the ($s=0$) bulk amplitudes. We showthat the four point function factorizes as a consequence of the non-criticalkinematics, but differently from the $N=0,1$ cases no extra discrete stateappears in the $\hat c\to 1^-$ limit.
