Title: On The Planar Yang-Mills Theory

Authors: Djordje Minic

Comments: 11 pages, TeX

The planar Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions is examined in aparticular representation which explicitly embodies factorization. Theeffective planar Yang-Mills theory Hamiltonian is constructed in thisrepresentation.
