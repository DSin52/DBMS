Adv.Theor.Math.PhysWe consider a family of pp-wave solutions of IIB supergravity. This familyhas a non-trivial, constant 5-form flux, and non-trivial, (light-cone)time-dependent RR and NS-NS 3-form fluxes. The solutions have either 16 or 20supersymmetries depending upon the time dependence. One member of this familyof solutions is the Penrose limit of the solution obtained by Pilch and Warneras the dual of a Leigh-Strassler fixed point. The family of solutions alsoprovides indirect evidence in support of a recent conjecture concerning a largeN duality group that acts on RG flows of N=2 supersymmetric, quiver gaugetheories.
