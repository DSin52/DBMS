We study a special class of higher derivative F-terms of the form$F_{g,n}W^{2g}(\Pi f)^{n}$ where W is the N=2 gravitational superfield and$\Pi$ is the chiral projector applied to a non-holomorphic function $f$ of theheterotic dilaton vector superfield. We analyze these couplings in theheterotic theory on $K3\times T^2$ , where it is found they satisfy an anomalyequation as the well studied $F_{g,0}$ terms. We recognize that, near a pointof SU(2) enhancement, a given generating function of the leading singularity ofthe $F_{g,n}$ reproduces the free energy of a c=1 string at an arbitrary radiusR. According to the N=2 heterotic-type II duality in 4d, we then study thesecouplings near a conifold singularity, using its local description in terms ofintersecting D-5-branes. In this context, it turns out that there exists, amongthe other states involved, a vector gauge field reproducing the heteroticleading singularity structure.
