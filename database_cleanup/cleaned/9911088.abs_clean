We compute the leading order perturbative correction to the static potentialin ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We show that the perturbativeexpansion contains infrared logarithms which, when resummed, become logarithmsof the coupling constant. The resulting correction goes in the right directionto match the strong coupling behavior obtained from the AdS/CFT correspondence.We find that the strong coupling extrapolation of the sum of ladder diagramsgoes as $\sqrt{g^2N}$, as in the supergravity approach.
