The anomaly due to the chiral fermions on the world-volume of the SO(32)five-brane is calculated. It is shown that this contribution has the correctstructure for it to be cancelled by the variation of the classical world-volumeaction. The cancellation mechanism requires a Green-Schwarz-like term in theclassical action. The result confirms the field content of the SO(32)five-brane proposed by Witten.
