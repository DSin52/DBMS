We study the second quantization of field theory on the q-deformed fuzzysphere for real q. This is performed using a path-integral over the modes,which generate a quasiassociative algebra. The resulting models have a manifestU_q(su(2)) symmetry with a smooth limit q -> 1, and satisfy positivity andtwisted bosonic symmetry properties. A systematic way to calculate n-pointcorrelators in perturbation theory is given. As examples, the 4-pointcorrelator for a free scalar field theory and the planar contribution to thetadpole diagram in \phi^4 theory are computed. The case of gauge fields is alsodiscussed, as well as an operator formulation of scalar field theory in 2_q + 1dimensions. An alternative, essentially equivalent approach using associativetechniques only is also presented. The proposed framework is not restricted to2 dimensions.
