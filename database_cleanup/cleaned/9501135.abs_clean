We construct a string field Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of open andclosed strings with effective target-space dimension $c\le 1 $. In order to doso, we first derive the Dyson-Schwinger equations for the underlying large $N$vector+matrix model and formulate them as a set of constraints satisfyingdecoupled Virasoro and U(1) current algebras. The Hamiltonian consists of abulk and a boundary term having different scaling dimensions. The timeparameters corresponding to the two terms are interpreted from the the point ofview of the fractal geometry of the world surface.
