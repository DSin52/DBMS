We give a confirmation of U-duality of type II superstring by discussing massspectrum of the BPS states. We first evaluate the mass spectrum of BPS solitonswith one kind of R-R charges. Our analysis is based on the 1-loop effectiveaction of D-brane, which is known as ``Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action'', andthe fact that BPS states correspond to the SUSY cycles with minimal volumes. Weshow the mass formula derived in this manner is completely fitted with thatgiven by U-duality. We further discuss the cases of BPS solitons possessingseveral kinds of R-R charges. These are cases of ``intersecting D-branes'',which cannot be described by simple DBI actions. We claim that, in these cases,higher loop corrections should be incorporated as binding energies between thebranes. It is remarkable that the summation of the contributions from all loopsreproduces the correct mass formula predicted by U-duality.
