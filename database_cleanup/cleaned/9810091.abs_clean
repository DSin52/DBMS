Title: Kadomtsev-Petviashvili Hierarchy and Generalized Kontsevich Model

Comments: LaTeX, 46 pp

The review is devoted to the integrable properties of the GeneralizedKontsevich Model which is supposed to be an universal matrix model to describethe conformal field theories with $c<1$. It is shown that the deformations ofthe "monomial" phase to "polynomial" one have the natural interpretation incontext of so-called equivalent hierarchies. The dynamical transition betweenequivalent integrable systems is exactly along the flows of the dispersionlessKadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy; the coefficients of the potential are shownto be directly related with the flat (quasiclassical) times arising in N=2Landau-Ginzburg topological model. The Virasoro constraint for solution with anarbitrary potential is shown to be a standard $\L_{-p}$-constraint of the(equivalent) $p$-reduced hierarchy with the times additively corrected by theflat coordinates.
