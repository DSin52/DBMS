Latex)We study the partition function of N=1 supersymmetric De Rham quantummechanics on a Riemannian manifold, with a nontrivial chemical potential $\mu$for the fermions. General arguments suggest that when $\mu \to \infty$ weshould get the partition function of a free point particle. We investigate thislimit by exact evaluation of the fermionic path integral. In even dimensions wefind the De Witt term with a definite numerical factor. However, in odddimensions our result is pestered by a quantum mechanical anomaly and thenumerical factor in the De Witt term remains ambiquous.
