The correspondence claimed by M. Douglas, between the multicritical regimesof the two-matrix model and 2D gravity coupled to (p,q) rational matter field,is worked out explicitly. We found the minimal (p,q) multicritical potentialsU(X) and V(Y) which are polynomials of degree p and q, correspondingly. Theloop averages W(X) and \tilde W(Y) are shown to satisfy the Heisenbergrelations {W,X} =1 and {\tilde W,Y}=1 and essentially coincide with thecanonical momenta P and Q. The operators X and Y create the two kinds ofboundaries in the (p,q) model related by the duality (p,q) - (q,p). Finally, wepresent a closed expression for the two two-loop correlators and interpret itsscaling limit.
