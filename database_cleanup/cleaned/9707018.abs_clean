We obtain the exact non-perturbative thresholds of $R^4$ terms in IIB stringtheory compactified to eight and seven dimensions. These thresholds are givenby the perturbative tree-level and one-loop results together with thecontribution of the D-instantons and of the $(p,q)$-string instantons. Theinvariance under U-duality is made manifest by rewriting the sum as anon-holomorphic modular function of the corresponding discrete U-duality group.In the eight-dimensional case, the threshold is the sum of a order-1 Eisensteinseries for $SL(2,Z)$ and a order-3/2 Eisenstein series for $SL(3,Z)$. Theseven-dimensional result is given by the order-3/2 Eisenstein series for$SL(5,Z)$. We also conjecture formulae for the non-perturbative thresholds inlower dimensional compactifications and discuss the relation with M-theory.
