Title: Branes from Moyal Deformation Quantization of Generalized Yang Mills

TheoriesComments: 8 pages, revised Tex file

It is shown that a Moyal deformation quantization of the SO(4k) GeneralizedYang-Mills (GYM) theory action in D=4k dimensions, for spacetime independentfield configurations, in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit, yields the Dirac-Nambu-Gotop-brane actions (obtained from the conformally invariant Dolan-Tchrakianp-brane actions after elimination of the auxiliary world volume metrics), inthe orthonormal gauge, for p+1=4k world volumes embedded in a D=4k targetspacetime background. The gauge fields/target spacetime coordinatescorrespondence is required but no large N limit is necessary. The equivalencebetween Moyal SDYM and Self Dual p-branes is proposed without choosing theorthonormal gauge.
