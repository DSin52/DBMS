From the computation of three-point singlet correlators in the two-matrixmodel, we obtain an explicit expression for the macroscopic three-loopamplitudes having boundary lengths $\ell_{i}$ $(i = 1\sim 3)$ in the case ofthe unitary series $(p,q)= (m+1,m)$ coupled to two-dimensional gravity. The sumappearing in this expression is found to conform to the structure of the CFTfusion rules while the summand factorizes through a product of three modifiedBessel functions. We briefly discuss a possible generalization of thesefeatures to macroscopic $n$-loop amplitudes.
