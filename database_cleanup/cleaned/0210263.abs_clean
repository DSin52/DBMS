We perform a systematic study of the Standard Model embedding in a D-braneconfiguration of type I string theory at the TeV scale. We end up with anattractive model and we study several phenomenological questions, such as gaugecoupling unification, proton stability, fermion masses and neutrinooscillations. At the string scale, the gauge group is U(3)_color x U(2)_weak xU(1)_1 x U(1)_bulk. The corresponding gauge bosons are localized on threecollections of branes; two of them describe the strong and weak interactions,while the last abelian factor lives on a brane which is extended in two largeextra dimensions with a size of afew microns. The hypercharge is a linearcombination of the first three U(1)s. All remaining U(1)s get masses at the TeVscale due to anomalies, leaving the baryon and lepton numbers as(perturbatively) unbroken global symmetries at low energies. The conservationof baryon number assures proton stability, while lepton number symmetryguarantees light neutrino masses that involve a right-handed neutrino in thebulk. The model predicts the value of the weak angle which is compatible withthe experiment when the string scale is in the TeV region. It also contains twoHiggs doublets that provide tree-level masses to all fermions of the heaviestgeneration, with calculable Yukawa couplings; one obtains a naturally heavy topand the correct ratio m_b/m_tau. We also study neutrino masses and mixings andwe show that a two-dimensional bulk can accommodate oscillations in agreementwith the solar (LMA and LOW solutions) and atmospheric experimental data.
