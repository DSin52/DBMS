Title: Thermal Correlators in Little String Theory

Authors: Philip A. DeBoer and Moshe Rozali

Comments: 13 pages

We calculate, using holographic duality, the thermal two-point function infinite temperature little string theory. The analysis of those correlatorsreveals possible instabilities of the thermal ensemble, as in previousdiscussions of the thermodynamics of little string theory. We comment on thedependence of the instability on the spatial volume of the system.
