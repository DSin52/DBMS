We obtain the high energy, small angle, 2-particle gravitational scatteringamplitudes in topologically massive gravity (TMG) and its two non-dynamicalconstituents, Einstein and Chern--Simons gravity. We use 't Hooft's approach,particles is taken to scatter through the classical spacetime generated by theother, which is idealized to be lightlike. The required geometries are derivedin all three models; in particular, we thereby provide the first explicitasymptotically flat solution generated by a localized source in TMG. Incontrast to $D$=4, the metrics are not uniquely specified, at least by naiveasymptotic requirements -- an indeterminacy mirrored in the scatteringamplitudes. The eikonal approach does provide a unique choice, however. We alsodiscuss the discontinuities that arise upon taking the limits, at the level ofthe solutions, from TMG to its constituents, and compare with the analogoustopologically massive vector gauge field models.
