There are several equivalent descriptions for constant B-field background ofopen string. The background can be interpreted as constant B-field as well asconstant gauge field strength or infinitely many D-branes with non-commutingChan-Paton matrices. In this article, the equivalence of these open stringtheories is studied in Witten's cubic open string field theory. Through the mapbetween these equivalent descriptions, both algebra of non-commutativecoordinates as well as Chan-Paton matrix algebra are identified withsubalgebras of open string field algebra.
