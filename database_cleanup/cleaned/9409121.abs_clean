We investigate quantum corrections of the 2-d dilaton gravity near thesingularity. Our motivation comes from a s-wave reduced cosmological solutionwhich is classically singular in the scalar fields (dilaton and moduli). Asresult we find, that the singularity disappears and a dilaton/moduli potentialis created.
