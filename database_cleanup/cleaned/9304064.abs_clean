Comments: 10pages; minor typo corrections

The spin degrees of freedom for the relativistic particle are described byeither Poincar\'{e} group variables (classically) or Grassmann variables(pseudo-classically). The relationship between those two descriptions aregiven. In doing that, appropriate constraints are constructed to put into thelagrangian. Especially a natural relation of Poincar\'{e} group variables andGrassmann variables is obtained. Hopf fibration relating the spin momentum tothe group is just the right transformation of the spin momentum underPoincar\'{e} group. And with the relation just mentioned, pseudoclassicallagrangian is derived naturally from the classical one.
