Journal-ref: JHEP 0204 (2002) 054

We calculate the subleading terms in the Born--Oppenheimer expansion for theeffective zero-mode Hamiltonian of N = 1, d=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theorywith any gauge group. The Hamiltonian depends on 3r abelian gauge potentialsA_i, lying in the Cartan subalgebra, and their superpartners (r being the rankof the group). The Hamiltonian belongs to the class of N = 2 supersymmetric QMHamiltonia constructed earlier by Ivanov and I. Its bosonic part describes themotion over the 3r--dimensional manifold with a special metric. The correctionsexplode when the root forms \alpha_j(A_i) vanish and the Born--Oppenheimerapproximation breaks down.
