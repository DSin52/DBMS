We review progress in studying the solutions of SQCD in the presence ofexplicit, soft SUSY breaking terms. Massive N=1 SQCD in the presence of a smallgaugino mass leads to a controlled solution which has interesting phasestructure with changing theta angle reminiscent of the QCD chiral Lagrangian.Current attempts to test the solutions of pure glue SQCD on the lattice requirea theoretical understanding of the theory with small gaugino mass in order tounderstand the approach to the SUSY point. We provide such a description makingpredictions for the gaugino condensate and lightest bound state masses. Finallywe briefly review recent D-brane constructions of 4D gauge theories in stringtheory including a non-supersymmetric configuration. We identify thisconfiguration with softly broken N=2 SQCD.
