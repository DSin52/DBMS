We study localization of gravity in flat space in superstring theory. We findthat an induced Einstein-Hilbert term can be generated only in four dimensions,when the bulk is a non-compact Calabi-Yau threefold with non-vanishing Eulernumber. The origin of this term is traced to R^4 couplings in ten dimensions.Moreover, its size can be made much larger than the ten-dimensionalgravitational Planck scale by tuning the string coupling to be very small orthe Euler number to be very large. We also study the width of the localizationand discuss the problems for constructing realistic string models with nocompact extra dimensions.
