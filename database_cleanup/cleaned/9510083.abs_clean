In the framework of noncommutative geometry we describe spinor fields withnonvanishing winding number on a truncated (fuzzy) sphere. The correspondingfield theory actions conserve all basic symmetries of the standard commutativeversion (space isometries and global chiral symmetry), but due to thenoncommutativity of the space the fields are regularized and they contain onlyfinite number of modes.
