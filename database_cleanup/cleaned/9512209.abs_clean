Approximating light charged point-like particles in terms of (nonextremal)dilatonic black holes is shown to lead to certain pathologies in Planckianscattering in the eikonal approximation, which are traced to the presence of a(naked) curvature singularity in the metric of these black holes. The existenceof such pathologies is confirmed by analyzing the problem in an `externalmetric' formulation where an ultrarelativistic point particle scatters off adilatonic black hole geometry at large impact parameters. The maladiesdisappear almost trivially upon imposing the extremal limit. Attempts to derivean effective three dimensional `boundary' field theory in the eikonal limit arestymied by four dimensional (bulk) terms proportional to the light-conederivatives of the dilaton field, leading to nontrivial mixing ofelectromagnetic and gravitational effects, in contrast to the case of generalrelativity. An eikonal scattering amplitude, showing decoupling of theseeffects, is shown to be derivable by resummation of graviton, dilaton andphoton exchange ladder diagrams in a linearized version of the theory, for anasymptotic value of the dilaton field which makes the string coupling constantnon-perturbative.
