We discuss the generalized Plateau problem in the 3+1 dimensionalSchwarzschild background. This represents the physical situation, which couldfor instance have appeared in the early universe, where a cosmic membrane (thindomain wall) is located near a black hole. Considering stationary axiallysymmetric membranes, three different membrane-topologies are possible dependingtopology and 2+1 black hole topology.Interestingly, we find that the different membrane-topologies are connectedvia phase transitions of the form first discussed by Choptuik in investigationsof scalar field collapse. More precisely, we find a first order phasetransition (finite mass gap) between wormhole topology and black hole topology;the intermediate membrane being an unstable wormhole collapsing to a blackhole. Moreover, we find a second order phase transition (no mass gap) betweenMinkowski topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being anaked singularity.For the membranes of black hole topology, we find a mass scaling relationanalogous to that originally found by Choptuik. However, in our case theparameter $p$ is replaced by a 2-vector $\vec{p}$ parametrizing the solutions.We find that $Mass\propto|\vec{p}-\vec{p}_*|^\gamma$ where $\gamma\approx0.66$. We also find a periodic wiggle in the scaling relation.Our results show that black hole formation as a critical phenomenon is farmore general than expected.
