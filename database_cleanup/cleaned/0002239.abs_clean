VariablesOne of the most efficient methods to obtain the vacuum expectation values forthe physical observables in the Casimir effect is based on the using theAbel-Plana summation formula. This allows to derive the regularized quantitiesby manifestly cutoff independent way and to present them in the form ofstrongly converging integrals. However the applications of Abel- Plana formulain usual form is restricted by simple geometries when the eigenmodes have asimple dependence on quantum numbers. The author generalized the Abel-Planaformula which essentially enlarges its application range. Based on thisgeneralization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series overthe zeros of some combinations of Bessel functions and for integrals involvingthese functions. It have been shown that these results generalize the specialcases existing in literature. Further the derived summation formulae have beenused to summarize series arising in the mode summation approach to the Casimireffect for spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries. This allows toextract the divergent parts from the vacuum expectation values for the localphysical observables in the manifestly cutoff independent way. The presentpaper reviews these results. Some new considerations are added as well.
