We investigate quantum nucleation of vortex string loops in the relativisticquantum field theory of a complex scalar field by using the Euclidean pathintegral. Our initial metastable homogeneous field dominated by the $O(3)$symmetric bounce solution. The nucleation rate and the critical vortex loopsize are obtained approximately. Gradually the initial current will be reducedto zero as the induced current inside vortex loops is opposite to the initialcurrent. We also discuss a similar process in Maxwell-Higgs systems andpossible physical implications.
