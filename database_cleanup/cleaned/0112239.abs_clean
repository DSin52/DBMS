Some problems on variations are raised for classical discrete mechanics andfield theory and the difference variational approach with variable step-lengthis proposed motivated by Lee's approach to discrete mechanics and thedifference discrete variational principle for difference discrete mechanics andfield theory on regular lattice. Based upon Hamilton's principle for thevertical variations and double operation of vertical exterior differential onaction, it is shown that for both continuous and variable step-lengthdifference cases there exists the nontrivial Euler-Lagrange cohomology as wellas the necessary and sufficient condition for symplectic/multi-symplecticstructure preserving properties is the relevant Euler-Lagrange 1-form is closedin both continuous and difference classical mechanics and field theory. Whilethe horizontal variations give rise to the relevant identities or relations ofthe Euler-Lagrange equation and conservation law of the energy/energy-momentumtensor for continuous or discrete systems. The total variations are alsodiscussed. Especially, for those discrete cases the variable step-length of thedifference is determined by the relation between the Euler-Lagrange equationand conservation law of the energy/energy-momentum tensor. In addition, thisapproach together with difference version of the Euler-Lagrange cohomology canbe applied not only to discrete Lagrangian formalism but also to theHamiltonian formalism for difference mechanics and field theory.
