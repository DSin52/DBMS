Comments: 10 pages, lanlmac

We show that the source of RR field computed from the boundary statedescribing the decay of a non-BPS brane is reproduced by a particular form ofthe Wess-Zumino term in the tachyon effective action. We also obtain a simpleexpression of the S-charge associated with rolling tachyons.
