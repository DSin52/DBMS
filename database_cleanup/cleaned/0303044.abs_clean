In an earlier paper, we showed that the causal boundary of any homogeneousplane wave satisfying the weak energy condition consists of a single null line.For conformally flat plane waves such as the Penrose limit of AdS_5 x S^5, allspacelike curves that reach infinity also end on this boundary and thecompletion is Hausdorff. However, the more generic case (including, e.g., thePenrose limits of AdS_4 x S^7 and AdS_7 x S^4) is more complicated. In onenatural topology, not all spacelike curves have limit points in the causalcompletion, indicating the need to introduce additional points at `spacelikeinfinity'--the endpoints of spacelike curves. We classify the distinct ways inwhich spacelike curves can approach infinity, finding a two-dimensional set ofdistinct limits. The dimensionality of the set of points at spacelike infinityis not, however, fixed from this argument. In an alternative topology, thecausal completion is already compact, but the completion is non-Hausdorff.
