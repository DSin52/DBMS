For a class of first order gauge theories it was shown that the propersolution of the BV-master equation can be obtained straightforwardly. Here wepresent the general condition which the gauge generators should satisfy toconclude that this construction is relevant. The general procedure isillustrated by its application to the Chern-Simons theory in any odd-dimension.Moreover, it is shown that this formalism is also applicable to BRST fieldtheories, when one replaces the role of the exterior derivative with the BRSTcharge of first quantization.
