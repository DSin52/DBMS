We show that toric geometry can be used rather effectively to translate abrane configuration to geometry. Roughly speaking the skeletons of toric spaceare identified with the brane configurations. The cases where the localgeometry involves hypersurfaces in toric varieties (such as P^2 blown up atmore than 3 points) presents a challenge for the brane picture. We also find asimple physical explanation of Batyrev's construction of mirror pairs ofCalabi-Yau manifolds using T-duality.
