International Conference on Path-Integrals from peV to TeV, FirenzeSome new expressions are found, concerning the effective action as aregularized path-integral for Dirac's spinors in {\it 3+1} dimensions, in thepresence of general uniform (i.e., constant and homogeneous) electric andmagnetic fields. The rate of $e^+e^-$ pairs production is computed and brieflydiscussed.
