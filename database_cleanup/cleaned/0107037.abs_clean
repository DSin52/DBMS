Studying the general structure of the noncommutative (NC) local groups, weprove a no-go theorem for NC gauge theories. According to this theorem, the{\it algebra} only admits the irreducible n by n matrix-representation. Hencethe gauge fields are in n by n matrix form, while the matter fields {\it canonly be} in fundamental, adjoint or singlet states; 2) for any gauge groupconsisting of several simple-group factors, the matter fields can transformnontrivially under {\it at most two} NC group factors. In other words, thematter fields cannot carry more than two NC gauge group charges. This no-gotheorem imposes strong restrictions on the NC version of the Standard Model andin resolving the standing problem of charge quantization in noncommutative QED.
