We summarize results on the reliability of the eikonal approximation inobtaining the high energy behavior of a two particle forward scatteringamplitude. Reliability depends on the spin of the exchanged field. For scalarfields the eikonal fails at eighth order in perturbation theory, when it missesthe leading behavior of the exchange-type diagrams. In a vector theory theeikonal gets the exchange diagrams correctly, but fails by ignoring certainnon-exchange graphs which dominate the asymptotic behavior of the fullamplitude. For spin--2 tensor fields the eikonal captures the leading behaviorof each order in perturbation theory, but the sum of eikonal terms issubdominant to graphs neglected by the approximation. We also comment on theeikonal for Yang-Mills vector exchange, where the additional complexities ofthe non-abelian theory may be absorbed into Regge-type modifications of thegauge boson propagators.
