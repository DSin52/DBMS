Mathematical Physics, in Guanajuato, Mexico, December of 1994. 10 latexpages, no figuresWe consider an 8--dimensional gravitational theory, which possesses aprinciple fiber bundle structure, with Lorentz--scalar fields coupled to themetric. One of them plays the role of a Higgs field and the other one that of adilaton field. The effective cosmological constant is interpreted as a Higgspotential. The Yukawa couplings are introduce by hand. The extra dimensionsconstitute a $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)_{Y} \times SU(2)_{R}$ group manifold. Diracfields are coupled to the potentials derived from the metric. As result, weobtain an effective four--dimensional theory which contains all couplings of aWeinberg--Salam--Glashow theory in a curved space-time. The masses of the gaugebosons and of the first two fermion families are given by the theory.
