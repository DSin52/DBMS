Using numerical simulations of the full nonlinear equations of motion weinvestigate topological solitons of a modified O(3) sigma model in three spacedimensions, in which the solitons are stabilized by the Hopf charge. We findthat for solitons up to charge five the solutions have the structure of closedstrings, which become increasingly twisted as the charge increases. However,for higher charge the solutions are more exotic and comprise linked loops andknots. We discuss the structure and formation of these solitons and demonstratethat the key property responsible for producing such a rich variety of solitonsis that of string reconnection.
