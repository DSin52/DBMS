We develop a general setting for N=2 rigid supersymmetric field theories withgauged central charge in harmonic superspace. We consider those N=2 multipletswhich have a finite number of off-shell components and exist off shell owing toa non-trivial central charge. This class includes, in particular, thehypermultiplet with central charge and various versions of the vector-tensormultiplet. For such theories we present a manifestly supersymmetric universalaction. Chern-Simons couplings to an external N=2 super Yang-Mills multipletare given, in harmonic superspace, for both the linear and nonlinearvector-tensor multiplets with gauged central charge. We show how to deduce thelinear version of the vector-tensor multiplet from six dimensions.
