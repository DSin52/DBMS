The main tool is the effective action for a given fixed valueof the phase of the Wilson line. It furnishes a gauge invariant infrared cutoff, and yields for small values of the phases a systematic procedure forobtaining a power series in the coupling g and glog(1/g). It breaks thecentergroup symmetry of the gauge group only at high temperature so leads todomain walls disappearing at low temperatures. It shows long lived metastablestates in the standard model, SU(5), SO(10) and its SUSY partners, withpossibilities for CP violation and thermal inflation.
