We greatly simplify the light-cone gauge description of a relativisticmembrane moving in Minkowski space by performing a field-dependent change ofvariables which allows the explicit solution of all constraints and aHamiltonian reduction to a $SO(1,3)$ invariant $2+1$-dimensional theory ofisentropic gas dynamics, where the pressure is inversely proportional to(minus) the mass-density. Simple expressions for the generators of thePoincar\'e group are given. We also find a generalized Lax pair which involvesas a novel feature complex conjugation. The extension to the supersymmetriccase, as well as to higher-dimensional minimal surfaces of codimension one isbriefly mentioned.
