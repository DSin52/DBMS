Title: 2+1 Gravity without dynamics

Authors: Viqar Husain

Comments: 9 pages

A three dimensional generally covariant theory is described that has a 2+1canonical decomposition in which the Hamiltonian constraint, which generatesthe dynamics, is absent. Physical observables for the theory are described andthe classical and quantum theories are compared with ordinary 2+1 gravity.
