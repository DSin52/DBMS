The bosonized Chiral Schwinger model (CSM) is quantized on the light-front(LF). The physical Hilbert space of CSM is obtained directly once theconstraints on the LF phase space are eliminated. The discussion of thedegenerate vacua and the absence in the CSM of the $\theta$-vacua, as found inthe Schwinger model (SM), becomes straightforward. The differences in thestructures of the the mass excitations and the vacua in these gauge theoriesare displayed transparently. The procedure followed is the one usedsuccessfully in the previous works for describing the spontaneous symmetrybreaking (SSB) and the SM on the LF. The physical contents following from theLF quantized theory agree with those known in the conventional treatment. TheLF hyperplane is argued to be equally appropriate as the conventionalequal-time one for the canonical quantization. Some comments on theirrelevance, in quantized field theory, of the fact that the hyperplanes$x^{\pm}=0$ constitute characteristic surfaces of hyperbolic partialdifferential equation are also made.
