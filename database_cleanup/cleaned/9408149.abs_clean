Yang-Mills MatterComments: 11 pages, Typos in equations corrected

It is shown that the one-loop quadratic divergences of standard supergravitycan be regulated by the introduction of heavy Pauli-Villars fields belonging tochiral and abelian gauge multiplets. The resulting one-loop correction can beinterpreted as a renormalization of the K\"ahler potential. Regularization ofthe dilaton couplings to the Yang-Mills sector requires special care, and mayshed some light on chiral/linear multiplet duality of the dilatonsupermultiplet.
