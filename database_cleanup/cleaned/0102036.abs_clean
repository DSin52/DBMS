The Lax pair of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with interaction potential oftrigonometric type based on Dn Lie algebra is presented. We give a general formfor the Lax pair and prove partial results for small n. Liouville integrabilityof the corresponding system follows a series of involutive Hamiltoniansgenerated by the characteristic polynomial of the Lax matrix. The rational caseappears as a natural degeneration and the nonrelativistic limit exactly leadsto the well-known Calogero-Moser system associated with Dn Lie algebra.
