We give a new integrable boundary condition in affine Toda theory which issoliton-preserving in the sense that a soliton hitting the boundary isreflected as a soliton. All previously known integrable boundary conditionsforced a soliton to be converted into an antisoliton upon reflection. We proveintegrability of our boundary condition using a generalization of Sklyanin'sformalism.
