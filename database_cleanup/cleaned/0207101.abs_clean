We study N=1,2,4 higher spin superalgebras in four dimensions and higher spingauge theories based on them. We extend the existing minimal N=2,4 theories andfind a minimal N=1 theory. Utilizing the basic structure of the minimal N=8theory, we express the full field equations for the N=1,2,4 theories in auniversal form without introducing Kleinian operators. We also use anon-minimal N=4 higher spin algebra tensored with U(3) to describe a higherspin extension of N=4 supergravity coupled to the massless vector multipletsarising in the KK spectrum of 11D supergravity on the N=3 supersymmetric AdS_4x N^{010} background. The higher spin theory also contains a triplet of vectormultiplets which may play a role in the super-Higgs effect in which N=4 isbroken down to N=3.
