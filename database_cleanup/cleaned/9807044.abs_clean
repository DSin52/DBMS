Using an octonionic formalism, we introduce a new mechanism for reducing 10spacetime dimensions to 4 without compactification. Applying this mechanism tothe free, 10-dimensional, massless (momentum space) Dirac equation results in aparticle spectrum consisting of exactly 3 generations. Each generation contains1 massive spin-1/2 particle with 2 spin states, 1 massless spin-1/2 particlewith only 1 helicity state, and their antiparticles --- precisely onegeneration of leptons. There is also a single massless spin-1/2particle/antiparticle pair with the opposite helicity and no generationstructure.We conclude with a discussion of some further consequences of this approach,including those which could arise when using the formalism on a curvedspacetime background, as well as the implications for the nature of spacetimeitself.
