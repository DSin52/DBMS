We compute the super Liouville action for a two dimensional Regge surface byexploiting the invariance of the theory under the superconformal group forsphere topology and under the supermodular group for torus topology. For spheretopology and torus topology with even spin structures, the action is completelyfixed up to a term which in the continuum limit goes over to a topologicalinvariant, while the overall normalization of the action can be taken fromperturbation theory. For the odd spin structure on the torus, due to thepresence of the fermionic supermodulus, the action is fixed up to a modularinvariant quadratic polynomial in the fermionic zero modes.
