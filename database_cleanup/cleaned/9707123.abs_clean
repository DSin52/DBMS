Two different mechanisms exist in non-perturbative String / M- theory forenhanced SU(N) (SO(2N)) gauge symmetries. It can appear in type IIA stringtheory or M-theory near an $A_{N-1}$ (D_N) type singularity where membrneswrapped around two cycles become massless, or it can appear due to coincidentD-branes (and orientifold planes) where open strings stretched between D-branesbecome massless. In this paper we exhibit the relationship between these twomechanisms by displaying a configuration in M-theory, which, in one limit, canbe regarded as membranes wrapped around two cycles with $A_{N-1}$ (D_N) typeintersection matrix, and in another limit, can be regarded as open stringsstretched between N Dirichlet 6-branes (in the presence of an orientifoldplane).
