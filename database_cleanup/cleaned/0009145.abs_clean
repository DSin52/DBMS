It is shown that all generalized two--dimensional dilaton theories witharbitrary matter content (with a curvature independent coupling to gravity) donot only obey a first law of black hole mechanics (which follows from Wald'sgeneral considerations, if the entropy S is defined appropriately), but also aand that, loosely speaking, for late times a stationary state is assumed. Alsoany two-dimensional f(R)--theory is covered. This generalizes a previous proofof Frolov [1] to a much wider class of theories.
