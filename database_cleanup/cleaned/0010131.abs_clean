Authors: A. A. Kirillov

Comments: 10 pages

It is shown that a nontrivial quantum structure of our space at macroscopicscales, which may exist as a relic of quantum gravity processes in the earlypicture in every physical process. This explains why statistical distributionsin radioactivity measurements may be different from the Poisson distribution.
