Title: Supersymmetry breaking and 4 dimensional string models

Authors: Michael Hewitt

Comments: 6 pages, Latex 2e

A family of superpotentials is constructed which may be relevant tosupersymmetry breaking in 4 dimensional (0,1) heterotic string models. Thescale of supersymmetry breaking, as well as the coupling constant, would bestable and could not run away to zero.
