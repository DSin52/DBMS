We study tensor perturbations in a model with inflating Randall--Sundrum-typebrane embedded in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (adS$_5$) bulk. In thismodel, a natural {\it in}-vacuum of gravitons is the vacuum defined in staticadS$_5$ frame. We show that this vacuum is, in fact, the same as the {\itin}-vacuum defined in the frame with de Sitter (dS$_4$) slicing, in which thebrane is at rest. Thus, during inflation, gravitons on and off the brane remainin their vacuum state. We then study graviton creation by the brane on whichinflation terminates at some moment of time. We mostly consider gravitons whosewavelengths at the end of inflation exceed both the horizon size and theadS$_5$ radius. Creation of these gravitons is dominated by (zero mode)--(zeromode) Bogoliubov coefficients and, apart from an overall factor, the spectrumof produced gravitons is the same as in four-dimensional theory.``Kaluza--Klein'' gravitons are also produced, but this effect is subdominant.Graviton spectra at somewhat higher momenta are also presented forcompleteness.
