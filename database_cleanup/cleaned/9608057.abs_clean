The bosonization of a massless fermionic field coupled to both vector andaxial-vector external sources is developed, following a path-integral approach.The resulting bosonized theory contains two antisymmetric tensor fields whoseactions consist of non-local Kalb-Ramond-like terms plus interactions. Exactbosonization rules that take the axial anomaly for the axial current intoaccount are derived, and an approximated bosonized action is constructed.
