The standard formulation of a massive Abelian vector field in $2+1$dimensions involves a Maxwell kinetic term plus a Chern-Simons mass term; inits place we consider a Chern-Simons kinetic term plus a Stuekelberg mass term.In this latter model, we still have a massive vector field, but now theinteraction with a charged spinor field is renormalizable (as opposed to superrenormalizable). By choosing an appropriate gauge fixing term, the Stuekelbergauxiliary scalar field decouples from the vector field. The one-loop spinorself energy is computed using operator regularization, a technique whichrespects the three dimensional character of the antisymmetric tensor$\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$. This method is used to evaluate the vector selfenergy to two-loop order; it is found to vanish showing that the beta functionis zero to two-loop order. The canonical structure of the model is examinedusing the Dirac constraint formalism.
