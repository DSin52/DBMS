Title: Measure Fields, The Cosmological Constant and Scale Invariance

Comments: Contribution to ICHEP 2000, Osaka, Japan. Latex 5 pages. To appear in

the ICHEP proceedings in World Scientific format, 3 pagesThe consequences of considering the measure of integration in the action tobe defined by degrees of freedom independent of the metric are studied. Modelswithout the cosmological constant problem, new ways of spontaneously breakingscale symmetry which have an interesting cosmology and theories of extendedobjects (string, branes) without a fundamental scale appear possible.
