The renormalisation group (RG) flow on the space of couplings of a simplemodel with two couplings is examined. The model considered is that of a singlecomponent scalar field with $\phi^4$ self interaction coupled, via Yukawacoupling, to a fermion in flat four dimensional space. The RG flow on the twodimensional space of couplings, ${\cal G}$, is shown to be derivable from apotential to sixth order in the couplings, which requires two loop calculationsof the $\beta$-functions. The identification of a potential requires theintroduction of a metric on ${\cal G}$ and it is shown that the metric definedby Zamalodchikov, in terms of two point correlation functions of compositeoperators, gives potential flow to this order.
