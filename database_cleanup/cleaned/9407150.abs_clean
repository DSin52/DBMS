We show that the topological $B \wedge F$ term in $3+1$ dimensions can begenerated via spontaneous symmetry breaking in a generalized Abelian Higgsmodel. Further, we also show that even in $D$ dimensions $ ( D \geq 3 ) $, a $B\wedge F$ term gives rise to the topological massive excitations of the Abeliangauge field and that such a $B \wedge F$ term can also be generated via Higgsmechanism.
