We present the results of a numerical calculation of the photon splittingrate below the electron-pair creation threshold ($\omega \le 2m$) in magneticfields $B ~{> \atop \sim}~ B_{\rm cr} = m^2 /e = 4.414 \times 10^{9}$ T. Ourresults confirm asymptotic approximations derived in the low-field ($B < B_{\rmcr}$) and high-field ($B \gg B_{\rm cr}$) limit, and allow interpolatingbetween the two asymptotic regions. Our expression for the photon splittingrate is a simplified version of a formula given by Mentzel et al. We also pointout that, although the analytical formula is correct, the splitting ratescalculated there are wrong due to an error in the numerical calculations.
