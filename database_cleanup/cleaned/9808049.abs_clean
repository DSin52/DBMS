Comments: Latex, 10 pp. Talk given at the International Workshop "Supersymmetry

and Integrable Systems" (June 22-26,1998, Dubna, Russia) and at the XthSchool-Seminar on Recent Problems in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics"VOLGA 10'98" (June 22-July 2, 1998, Kazan, Russia)Journal-ref: Recent Problems in Physics.1998, pp.231-240, Ed. A.V. Aminova

(Kazan, 1998)We study duality properties of actions for chiral boson fields in variousspace-time dimensions using D=2 and D=6 cases as examples. As a result we getdual covariant formulations of chiral bosons.
