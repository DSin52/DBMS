Using standard field theory techniques we compute perturbative and instantoncontributions to the Coulomb branch of three-dimensional supersymmetric QCDwith N=2 and N=4 supersymmetry and gauge group SU(2). For the N=4 theory withone massless flavor, we confirm the proposal of Seiberg and Witten that theCoulomb branch is the double-cover of the centered moduli space of two BPSmonopoles constructed by Atiyah and Hitchin. Introducing a hypermultiplet massterm, we show that the asymptotic metric on the Coulomb branch coincides withthe metric on Dancer's deformation of the monopole moduli space. For the N=2theory with $N_f$ flavors, we compute the one-loop corrections to the metricand complex structure on the Coulomb branch. We then determine thesuperpotential including one-loop effects around the instanton background.These calculations provide an explicit check of several results previouslyobtained by symmetry and holomorphy arguments.
