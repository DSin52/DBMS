This is a short review on the thermal, spectral representation in thereal-time version of the finite temperature quantum field theory. Afterpresenting a clear derivation of the spectral representation, we discuss theproperties of its spectral function. Two applications of this representationare then considered. One is the solution of the Dyson equation for the thermalpropagator. The other is the formulation of the QCD sum rules at finitetemperature.
