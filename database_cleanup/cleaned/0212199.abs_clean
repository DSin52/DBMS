Title: D-branes in a marginally deformed WZW model

Comments: 7 pages, contribution to the proceedings of the 35th Symposium

Ahrenshoop, 2002In this talk we discuss symmetry preserving D-branes on a line of amarginally deformed SU(2) WZW model. A semiclassical and a quantum theoreticalapproach are presented.
