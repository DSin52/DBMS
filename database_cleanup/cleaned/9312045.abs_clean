Finite rational $\cw$ algebras are very natural structures appearing in cosetconstructions when a Kac-Moody subalgebra is factored out. In this letter weaddress the problem of relating these algebras to integrable hierarchies ofequations, by showing how to associate to a rational $\cw$ algebra itsleading to the Non-Linear Schr\"{o}dinger hierarchy, and the $U(1)$ coset ofthe Polyakov-Bershadsky $\cw$ algebra, leading to a $3$-field representation ofthe KP hierarchy already encountered in the literature. In such examples arational algebra appears as algebra of constraints when reducing a KP hierarchyto a finite field representation. This fact arises the natural question whetherrational algebras are always associated to such reductions and whether aclassification of rational algebras can lead to a classification of theintegrable hierarchies.
