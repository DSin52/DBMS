We discuss the processes of brane bubble nucleation induced by the externalbranes. The quasiclassical solution for the nucleation by the single externalbrane has been found in the case when the brane junctions are possible.Exponential factor in the production rate has been calculated. The processinduced by the fundamental or D string in the background of two D3 branes isanalyzed and its interpretation from the D3 worldvolume theory viewpoint isdescribed.
