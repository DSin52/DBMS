A general condition for the existence of fermion zero modes is derived forthe M-5-brane, the M-2-brane and the D=4, N=2 Majumdar-Papapetrou 0-brane. Thefermion zero modes of these p-branes do not exist if the supersymmetry spinorgenerator goes to a constant at the horizon and they exist only if it vanishesthere. In particular it is shown that the fermion zero mode of the M-2-brane inD=11 can be forbidden from existence if Rarita-Schwinger gamma tracelessnesscondition is imposed on the gravitino field. Non-existence of fermion zero modeis interpreted, in analogy to the three dimensional example of Becker et.al.,as a world with zero cosmological constant without supersymmetric excitedstates. Also derived are the spin of the M-5-brane and its 3-form electric andmagnetic dipole moments.
