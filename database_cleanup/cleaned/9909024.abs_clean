Title: Evolution of the Bogoluibov Renormalization Group

Comments: 44 pages, LaTeX

We start with a simple introduction into the renormalization group (RG) inquantum field theory and give an overview of the renormalization group method.The third section is devoted to essential topics of the renorm-group use in theQFT. Here, some fresh results are included.Then we turn to the remarkable proliferation of the RG ideas into variousfields of physics. The last section summarizes an impressive recent progress ofthe "QFT renormalization group" application in mathematical physics.
