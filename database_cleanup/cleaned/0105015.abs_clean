Authors: E. P. Gueuvoghlanian

Comments: latex, 9 pages

A bicomplex structure is associated to the Leznov-Saveliev equation ofintegrable models. The linear problem associated to the zero curvaturecondition is derived in terms of the bicomplex linear equation. The explicitexample of a Non-Abelian Conformal Affine Toda model is discussed in detail andits conservation laws are derived from the zero curvature representation of itsequation of motion.
