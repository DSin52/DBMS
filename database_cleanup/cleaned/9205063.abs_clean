Instructions included. Uncompressed version available from authorThis thesis is a study of two dimensional noncritical string theory. The maintool which is used, is the matrix model. Introductions to both the Liouvillemodel and its matrix model formulation are included. In particular the specialstates are discussed. Some calculations of partition functions on genus oneusing field theory techniques are given. Nonperturbative issues and stringtheory at finite radius are discussed. Zero momentum correlation functions arecalculated using the matrix model. One important result is a set of recursionrelations. The treatment is extended to nonzero momentum. The main result is aclear identification of the special states. Some comments on the Wheeler deWitt equation is given. The matrix model $W_{\infty}$ algebra is introduced.This organizes the previous results. In particular, a simple derivation of thegenus zero tachyon correlation functions is given. The results are thenextended to higher genus. It is seen how a deformation of the algebra isresponsible for much of the higher genus structure. Some very explicit formulaeare derived. Then the Liouville and matrix model calculations are comparedfollowed by some general conclusions.
