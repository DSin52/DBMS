We find a new class of cosmic string solutions with non-vanishing magneticflux of $\cN=1$, D=4 supergravity with a cosmological constant and coupled toany number of Maxwell and scalar multiplets. We show that these magnetic cosmicstring solutions preserve 1/2 of supersymmetry. We give an explicit example ofsuch a solution for which the complex scalars are constant and the spacetime issmooth with topology $R^{1,1}\times S^2$. Two more examples are explored forwhich a complex scalar field takes values in $\bC P^1$ and in $SL(2,\bR)/U(1)$.
