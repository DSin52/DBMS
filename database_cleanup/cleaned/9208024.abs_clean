I discuss in detail the construction of realistic superstring standard--likemodels in the four dimensional free fermionic formulation. The analysis resultsthree generations of chiral fermions with their superpartners and the correctStandard Model quantum numbers. (ii) Proton decay from dimension four anddimension five operators is suppressed due to gauged $U(1)$ symmetries. (iii)There exist Higgs doublets from two distinct sectors, which can generaterealistic symmetry breaking. (iv) These models explain the top--bottom masshierarchy. At the trilinear level of the superpotential only the top quark getsa non vanishing mass term. The bottom quark and the lighter quarks and leptonsget their mass terms from non renormalizable terms. This result is correlatedwith the requirement of a supersymmetric vacuum at the Planck scale. (v) Themodels predict the existence of small hidden gauge groups, like $SU(3)$, withmatter spectrum in vector representations.
