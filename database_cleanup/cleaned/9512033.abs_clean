We consider a certain local generalization of BRS transformations ofYang-Mills theory in which the anti-commuting parameter is space timedependent. While these are not exact symmetries, they do lead to a newnontrivial WT identity. We make a precise connection between the ``local BRS"and the broken orthosymplectic symmetry recently found in superspaceformulation of Yang-Mills theory by showing that the local BRS WT identity isprecisely the WT identity obtained in the superspace formulation via asuperrotation. This ``local BRS " WT identity could lead to new consequencesnot contained in the usual BRS WT identity.
