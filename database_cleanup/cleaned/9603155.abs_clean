A point particle approximation to the classical dynamics of well separatedvortices of the abelian Higgs model is developed. A static vortex isasymptotically identical to a solution of the linearized field theory (aKlein-Gordon/Proca theory) in the presence of a singular point source at thevortex centre. It is shown that this source is a composite scalar monopole andmagnetic dipole, and the respective charges are determined numerically forvarious values of the coupling constant. The interaction potential of two wellseparated vortices is computed by calculating the interaction Lagrangian of twosuch point sources in the linear theory. The potential is used to model type IIvortex scattering.
