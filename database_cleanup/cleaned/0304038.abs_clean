Assuming spherical symmetry we analyse the dynamics of an inhomogeneous darkradiation vaccum on a Randall and Sundrum 3-brane world. Under certain naturalconditions we show that the effective Einstein equations on the brane form aclosed system. On a de Sitter brane and for negative dark energy density wedetermine exact dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions which depend on the branecosmological constant, on the dark radiation tidal charge and on its initialconfiguration. We also identify the conditions leading to the formation of asingularity or of regular bounces inside the dark radiation vaccum.
