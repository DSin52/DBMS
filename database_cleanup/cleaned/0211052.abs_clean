Title: Perturbative Derivation of Exact Superpotential for Meson Fields from

Matrix Theories with One FlavourAuthors: Hisao Suzuki

Comments: 9 pages, latex, typos corrected

We derive the superpotential of gauge theories having matter fields in thefundamental representation of gauge fields by using the method of Dijkgraaf andVafa. We treat the theories with one flavour and reproduce a well-knownnon-perturbative superpotential for meson field.
