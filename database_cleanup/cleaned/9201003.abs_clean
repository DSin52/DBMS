Title: Intersection Theory, Integrable Hierarchies and Topological Field Theory

Authors: Robbert Dijkgraaf

Comments: 73 pages, most figures are not included. Lectures given at the

Cargese Summer School on `New Symmetry Principles in Quantum Field Theory,'July 16-27, 1991.In these lecture notes we review the various relations between intersectiontheory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, integrable hierarchies of KdVtype, matrix models, and topological quantum field theories. We explain inparticular why matrix integrals of the type considered by Kontsevich naturallyappear as tau-functions associated to minimal models. Our starting point is theextremely simple form of the string equation for the topological (p,1) models,where the so-called Baker-Akhiezer function is given by a (generalized) Airyfunction.
