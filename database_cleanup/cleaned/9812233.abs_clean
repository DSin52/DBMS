When an electrically charged source is capable of both emitting theelectromagnetic waves and creating charged particles from the vacuum, itsradiation gets so much amplified that only the backreaction of the vacuum makesit finite. The released energy and charge are calculated in the high-frequencyapproximation. The technique of expectation values is advanced and employed.
