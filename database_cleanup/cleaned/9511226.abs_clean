In a previous publication [1], local gauge invariant geometric variables wereintroduced to describe the physical Hilbert space of Yang-Mills theory. Inthese variables, the electric energy involves the inverse of an operator whichcan generically have zero modes, and thus its calculation is subtle. In thepresent work, we resolve these subtleties by considering a small deformation inthe definition of these variables, which in the end is removed. The case ofspherical configurations of the gauge invariant variables is treated in detail,as well as the inclusion of infinitely heavy point color sources, and theexpression for the associated electric field is found explicitly. Thesespherical geometries are seen to correspond to the spatial components ofinstanton configurations. The related geometries corresponding to Wu-Yangmonopoles and merons are also identified.
