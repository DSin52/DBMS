Title: Central extensions and quantum physics

Comments: 20 pages, LaTeX, no figures; added material

The unitary implementation of a symmetry group $G$ of a classical system inthe corresponding quantum theory entails unavoidable deformations $\TG$ of $G$,namely, central extensions by the typical phase invariance group U(1). Theappearance of central charges in the corresponding Lie-algebra quantumcommutators, as a consequence of non-trivial responses of the phase of the wavefunction under symmetry transformations, lead to a quantum generation of extradegrees of freedom with regard to the classical counterpart. In particular,symmetries of the Hall effect, Yang-Mills and conformally invariant classicalfield theories are affected when passing to the quantum realm.
