Title: Massless and spinning particles as dynamics in one dimensional

(super)diffeomorphism groupsComments: last section corrected, notations simplified, one reference added

It is shown that dynamics of D+2 elements of the (super)diffeomorphism groupin one (1+1 for the super) dimension describes the D - dimensional (spinning)massless relativistic particles. The coordinates of this elements (D+2einbeins, D+2 connections and 1 additional common coordinate of higherdimensionality) play the role of coordinates, momenta and Lagrange multiplier,needed for the manifestly conformal and reparametrization invariant descriptionof the D - dimensional (spinning) particle in terms of the D+2 - dimensionalspacetime.
