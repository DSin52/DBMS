We study string theory on orbifolds in the presence of an antisymmetricconstant background field in detail and discuss some of new aspects of thetheory. It is pointed out that the term with the antisymmetric background fieldcan be regarded as a topological term like a Chern-Simons term or a Wess-Zuminoterm. Detailed analysis in the operator formalism shows that orbifold modelsmode variables obey nontrivial quantization conditions. Coordinatetransformations which define orbifolds are modified at quantum level. Wavefunctions of twisted strings in general acquire nontrivial phases when theymove around non-contractible loops on orbifolds. Zero mode eigenvalues areshifted from naively expected values, in favor of modular invariance.
