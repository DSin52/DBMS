We compute the coefficients of an infinite family of chiral primary operatorsin the local operator expansion of a circular Wilson loop in N=4 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory. The computation sums all planar rainbow Feynman graphs. Weargue that radiative corrections from planar graphs with internal verticescancel in leading orders and we conjecture that they cancel to all orders inperturbation theory. The coefficients are non-trivial functions of the 'tHooftcoupling and their strong coupling limits are in exact agreement with thosepreviously computed using the AdS/CFT correspondence. They predict thesubleading orders in strong coupling and could in principle be compared withstring theory calculations.
