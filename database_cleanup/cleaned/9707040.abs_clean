The Green functions of the partial differential operators of even orderacting on smooth sections of a vector bundle over a Riemannian manifold areinvestigated via the heat kernel methods. We study the resolvent of a specialclass of higher-order operators formed by the products of second-orderoperators of Laplace type defined with the help of a unique Riemannian metricbut with different bundle connections and potential terms. The asymptoticexpansion of the Green functions near the diagonal is studied in detail in anydimension. As a by-product a simple criterion for the validity of the Huygensprinciple is obtained. It is shown that all the singularities as well as thenon-analytic regular parts of the Green functions of such high-order operatorsare expressed in terms of the usual heat kernel coefficients $a_k$ for aspecial Laplace type second-order operator.
