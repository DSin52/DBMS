The truncated 4-dimensional sphere $S^4$ and the action of theself-interacting scalar field on it are constructed. The path integralquantization is performed while simultaneously keeping the SO(5) symmetry andthe finite number of degrees of freedom. The usual field theory UV-divergencesare manifestly absent.
