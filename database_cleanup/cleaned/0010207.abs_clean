We study topology change in M theory compactifications on Calabi-Yauthree-folds in the presence of G flux (the four form field strength). Inparticular, we discuss vacuum solutions in strongly coupled heterotic stringtheory in which the topology change is inevitable within a single spacetimebackground. For rather generic choices of initial conditions, the fieldequations drive the Kahler moduli outside the classical moduli space of aCalabi-Yau manifold. Consistency of the solution suggests that degenerate flopcurves - just as wrapped M theory fivebranes - carry magnetic charges under thefour form field strength.
