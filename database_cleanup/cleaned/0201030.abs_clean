Five nontrivial stationary points are found for maximal gauged N=16supergravity in three dimensions with gauge group $SO(8)\times SO(8)$ byrestricting the potential to a submanifold of the space of$SU(3)\subset(SO(8)\times SO(8))_{\rm diag}$ singlets. The constructionpresented here uses the embedding of $E_{7(+7)}\subset E_{8(+8)}$ to lift theanalysis of N=8, D=4 supergravity performed by N. Warner to N=16, D=3, andhence, these stationary points correspond to some of the known extrema ofgauged N=8, D=4 supergravity.
