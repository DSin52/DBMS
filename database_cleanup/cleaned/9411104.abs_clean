2277-2283In this paper we consider the problem of spontaneous supersymmetrybreaking in $N=4$ supergravity interacting with vector multiplets. Westart with the ordinary version of such model with the scalar fieldgeometry $SU(1,1)/U(1)\otimes SO(6,m)/SO(6)\otimes SO(m)$. Then weconstruct a dual version of this theory with the same scalar fieldgeometry, which corresponds to the interaction of arbitrary number ofvector multiplets with the hidden sector, admitting spontaneoussupersymmetry breaking without a cosmological term. We show thatsupersymmetry breaking is still possible in the presence of matterfields.
