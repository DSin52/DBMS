We study ghost number one excitations on the sliver to investigate thesolution of string field actions around the tachyon vacuum. The generalizedgluing and resmoothing theorem is used to develop a method for evaluating theeffective action for excitations on both the wedge states and the sliver state.We analyze the discrete symmetries of the resulting effective action forexcitations on the sliver. The gauge unfixed effective action till level twoexcitations on the sliver is evaluated. This is done for the case with the BRSToperator $c_0$ and $c_0 + (c_2 + c_{-2})/2$ with excitations purely in theghost sector. We find that the values of the effective potential at the localmaximum lie close by for the zeroth and the second level of approximation. Thisindicates that level truncation in string field theory around the tachyonvacuum using excitations on the sliver converges for both choices of the BRSToperator. It also provides evidence for the conjectured string field theoryactions around the tachyon vacuum.
