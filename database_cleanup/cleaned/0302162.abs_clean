The correlation functions of open Wilson line operators in two-dimensionalYang-Mills theory on the noncommutative torus are computed exactly. Thecorrelators are expressed in two equivalent forms. An instanton expansioninvolves only topological numbers of Heisenberg modules and enables extractionof the weak-coupling limit of the gauge theory. A dual algebraic expansioninvolves only group theoretic quantities, winding numbers and translationalzero modes, and enables analysis of the strong-coupling limit of the gaugetheory and the high-momentum behaviour of open Wilson lines. The dualexpressions can be interpreted physically as exact sums over contributions fromvirtual electric dipole quanta.
