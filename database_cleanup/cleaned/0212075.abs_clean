We prove that the asymptotic field of a Skyrme soliton of any degree has anon-trivial multipole expansion. It follows that every Skyrme soliton has awell-defined leading multipole moment. We derive an expression for the linearinteraction energy of well-separated Skyrme solitons in terms of their leadingmultipole moments. This expression can always be made negative by suitablerotations of one of the Skyrme solitons in space and iso-space.We show that thelinear interaction energy dominates for large separation if the orders of theSkyrme solitons' multipole moments differ by at most two. In that case thereare therefore always attractive forces between the Skyrme solitons.
