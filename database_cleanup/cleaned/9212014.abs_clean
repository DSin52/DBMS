We present results of a high precision Monte Carlo simulation of dynamicallytriangulated random surfaces (up to $\approx$ 34,000 triangles) coupled to onescalar field ($c=1$). The mean square extent has been measured for differentactions to test the universality of the leading term as a function of the sizeof the surfaces. Furthermore, the integrated 2-point correlation function forvertex operators is compared with conformal field theory and matrix modelpredictions.
