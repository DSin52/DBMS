We discuss the $2+1$ dimensional Abelian Higgs model coupled to $N=2$supergravity. We construct the supercharge algebra and, from it, we show thatthe mass of classical static solutions is bounded from below by the topologicalcharge. As it happens in the global case, half of the supersymmetry is brokenwhen the bound is attained and Bogomol'nyi equations, resulting from theunbroken supersymmetry, hold. These equations, which correspond to gravitatingvortices, include a first order self-duality equation whose integrabilitycondition reproduces the Einstein equation.
