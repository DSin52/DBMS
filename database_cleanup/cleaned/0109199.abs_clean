The tetrad gauge invariant theory of the free Dirac field in two specialmoving charts of the de Sitter spacetime is investigated pointing out theoperators that commute with the Dirac one. These are the generators of thesymmetry transformations corresponding to isometries that give rise toconserved quantities according to the Noether theorem. With their help theplane wave spinor solutions of the Dirac equation with given momentum andhelicity are derived and the final form of the quantum Dirac field isestablished. It is shown that the canonical quantization leads to a correctphysical interpretation of the massive or massless fermion quantum fields.
