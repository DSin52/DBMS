We investigate the Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) description of ($Z_2$invariant) one-component scalar field theory, in the approximation in which allmomentum dependence is discarded in the effective vertices. In this context weshow how one can perform a systematic search for non-perturbative continuumlimits without making any assumption about the form of the lagrangian.Concentrating on the non-perturbative three dimensional Wilson fixed point, wethen show that the sequence of truncations $n=2,3,\dots$, obtained by expandingabout the field $\varphi=0$ and discarding all powers $\varphi^{2n+2}$ andhigher, yields solutions that at first converge to the answer obtained withouttruncation, but then cease to further converge beyond a certain point. Nocompletely reliable method exists to reject the many spurious solutions thatare also found. These properties are explained in terms of the analyticbehaviour of the untruncated solutions -- which we describe in some detail.
