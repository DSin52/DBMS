We clarify the relation between the approach to $q$-Minkowski space ofCarow-Watamura et al. with an approach based on the idea of $2\times 2$ braidedHermitean matrices. The latter are objects like super-matrices but withBose-Fermi statistics replaced by braid statistics. We also obtain new R-matrixformulae for the $q$-Poincare group in this framework.
