A path-integral approach for delta-function potentials is presented.Particular attention is paid to the two-dimensional case, which illustrates therealization of a quantum anomaly for a scale invariant problem in quantummechanics. Our treatment is based on an infinite summation of perturbationtheory that captures the nonperturbative nature of the delta-function boundstate. The well-known singular character of the two-dimensional delta-functionpotential is dealt with by considering the renormalized path integral resultingregularization. Moreover, compatibility of the bound-state and scatteringsectors is shown.
