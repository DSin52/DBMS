Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B382 (1996) 53-59

I exhibit a middle-dimensional square integrable harmonic form on the modulispace of distinct fundamental BPS monopoles of an arbitrary Lie group. This isin accord with Sen's S-duality conjecture. I also show that the moduli spacehas no closed or bound geodesics.
