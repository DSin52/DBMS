We present some arguments showing spectrum doubling of matrix models in thelimit $N\to\infty$ which is connected with fermionic determinant behaviour. Theproblems are similar to ones encountered in the lattice gauge theories withchiral fermions. One may discuss the ``physical meaning'' of the doublingstates or ways to eliminate them. We briefly consider both situations.
