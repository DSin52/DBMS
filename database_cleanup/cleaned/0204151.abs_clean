The Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) RG flow in the ensemble of monopolesexisting in the finite-temperature (2+1)D Georgi-Glashow model is explored inthe regime when the Higgs field is not infinitely heavy, but its mass is ratherof the same order of magnitude as the mass of the W-boson. The corrections tothe standard RG flow are derived to the leading order in the inverse mass ofthe Higgs boson. According to the obtained RG equations, the scaling of thefree-energy density in the critical region and the value of the criticaltemperature of the phase transition are found to be unaffected by thefiniteness of the Higgs-boson mass. The evolution of the Higgs mass itself isalso investigated and shown to be rather weak, that enables one to treat thisparameter as a constant. The same analysis is further performed in theSU(N)-case at N>2, where the RG invariance is demonstrated to hold onlyapproximately, in a certain sense. Modulo this approximation, the criticalbehaviour of the SU(N)-model turns out to be identical to that of theSU(2)-one.
