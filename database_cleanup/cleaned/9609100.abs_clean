We study the effects of internal symmetries on the decay by bubble nucleationof a metastable false vacuum. The zero modes about the bounce solution that areassociated with the breaking of continuous internal symmetries result in anenhancement of the tunneling rate into vacua in which some of the symmetries ofthe initial state are spontaneously broken. We develop a general formalism forevaluating the effects of these zero modes on the bubble nucleation rate inboth flat and curved space-times.
