A brief pedagogical survey of the star product is provided, throughGroenewold's original construction based on the Weyl correspondence. It is thenillustrated how simple Landau orbits in a constant magnetic field, throughtheir Dirac Brackets, define a noncommutative structure since these bracketsexponentiate to a star product---a circumstance rarely operative for genericDirac Brackets. The geometric picture of the star product based on its Fourierrepresentation kernel is utilized in the evaluation of chains of star products.The intuitive appreciation of their associativity and symmetries is therebyenhanced. This construction is compared and contrasted with the remarkablephase-space polygon construction of Almeida.
