There are at present two known string theories in $(2,2)$ dimensions. One ofthem is the well known $N=2$ string, and the other one is a more recentlyconstructed $N=1$ spacetime supersymmetric string. They are both based oncertain twistings and/or truncations of the small $N=4$ superconformal algebra,realised in terms of $(2,2)$ superspace variables. In this paper, weinvestigate more general possibilities for string theories based on algebrasbuilt with the same set of fields. We find that there exists one more stringtheory, based on an algebra which is not contained within the $N=4$superconformal algebra. We investigate the spectrum and interactions of thistheory.
