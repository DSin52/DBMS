The ordinary Poisson brackets in field theory do not fulfil the Jacobiidentity if boundary values are not reasonably fixed by special boundaryconditions. We show that these brackets can be modified by adding some surfaceterms to lift this restriction. The new brackets generalize a canonical bracketconsidered by Lewis, Marsden, Montgomery and Ratiu for the free boundaryproblem in hydrodynamics. Our definition of Poisson brackets permits to treatboundary values of a field on equal footing with its internal values anddirectly estimate the brackets between both surface and volume integrals. Thisconstruction is applied to any local form of Poisson brackets. A prescriptionfor delta-function on closed domains and a definition of the {\it full}variational derivative are proposed.
