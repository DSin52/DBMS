We show that the anomalous contribution to the central charge of the1+1-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric kink that is required for BPS saturation atthe quantum level can be linked to an analogous term in the extra momentumoperator of a 2+1-dimensional kink domain wall with spontaneous parityviolation and chiral domain wall fermions. In the quantization of the domainwall, BPS saturation is preserved by nonvanishing quantum corrections to themomentum density in the extra space dimension. Dimensional reduction from 2+1to 1+1 dimensions preserves the unbroken N=1/2 supersymmetry and turns theseparity-violating contributions into the anomaly of the central charge of thesupersymmetric kink. On the other hand, standard dimensional regularization bydimensional reduction from 1 to (1-epsilon) spatial dimensions, which alsopreserves supersymmetry, obtains the anomaly from an evanescent counterterm.
