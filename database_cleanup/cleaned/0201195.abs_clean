The energy eigenvalues of the superintegrable chiral Potts model aredetermined by the zeros of special polynomials which define finiterepresentations of Onsager's algebra. The polynomials determining thelow-sector eigenvalues have been given by Baxter in 1988. In the Z_3-case theysatisfy 4-term recursion relations and so cannot form orthogonal sequences.However, we show that they are closely related to Jacobi polynomials andsatisfy a special "partial orthogonality" with respect to a Jacobi weightfunction.
