In contrast with the classical gauge group cases, any method to prove exactlythe scaling relation which relates moduli and prepotential is not known in thecase of exceptional gauge groups. This paper provides a direct method toestablish this relation by using Picard-Fuchs equations. In particular, it isshown that the scaling relation found by Ito in N=2 supersymmetric G_2Yang-Mills theory actually holds exactly.
