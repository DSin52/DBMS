We re-examine the OSp(N,4) invariant interacting model of massless chiral andgauge superfields, whose superconformal invariance was instrumental, both inproving the all-order no-renormalization of the mass and chiralself-interaction lagrangians, and in determining the linear superfieldrenormalization needed. We show that the renormalization of the gravitationalaction modifies only the cosmological term, without affecting higher-ordertensors. This could explain why the effect of the cosmological constant isshadowed by the effects of newtonian gravity.
