A new nonperturbative approach is used to investigate the Gross-Neveu modelof four fermion interaction in the space-time dimensions 2, 3 and 4, the number$N$ of inner degrees of freedom being a fixed integer. The spontaneous symmetrybreaking is shown to exist in $D=2,3$ and the running coupling constant iscalculated. The four dimensional theory seems to be trivial.
