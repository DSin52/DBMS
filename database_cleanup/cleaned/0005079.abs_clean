Title: A Class of Anomaly-Free Gauge Theories

Authors: G.Roepstorff

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX2e, AMS fonts

We report on a detailed calculation of the anomaly coefficients for the oddand even parts of the $Z_2$-graded representation $\theta$ of the Lie algebraLie$ G$ on the exterior algebra of dimension $2^n$ assuming that $G\subsetU(n)$. The coefficients vanish provided $G\subset SU(n)$ and $n\ne3$. Thesingular role of the gauge group SU(3) is emphasized.The Standard Model is covered by this result.
