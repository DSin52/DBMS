A concise presentation of the PF equations for N=2 Seiberg-Witten theoriesfor the classical groups of rank r with N_f massless hypermultiplets in thefundamental representation is provided. For N_f=0, all r PF equations can begiven in a generic form. For certain cases with N_f\neq zero, not all equationsare generic. However, in all cases there are at least r-2 generic PF equations.For these cases the classical part of the equations is generic, while thequantum part can be formulated using a method described in a previous paper bythe authors, which is well suited to symbolic computer calculations.
