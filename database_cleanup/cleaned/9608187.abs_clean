We study the non-abelian extension for the splitting of a scalar field intochiral components. Using this procedure we find a non ambiguous way of couplinga non abelian chiral scalar field to gravity. We start with a (non-chiral) WZWmodel covariantly coupled to a background metric and, after the splitting,arrive at two chiral Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models coupled to gravity.
