the workshop ``Quark confinement and the hadron spectrum'', 20--24 June 1994,Como, ItalyThe derivation of the $ q \bar q $ and the $ 3q $ potential for two dynamicalquarks in a Wilson--loop context is reviewed. Some improvements are introduced.Only the usual assumptions in the evaluation of the Wilson loop integrals andexpansions in the quark velocities are required for the result. It is shownthat under the same assumptions it is possible to obtain the relativisticflux--tube lagrangian and a $ q \bar{q}$ Bethe--Salpeter equation with aconfining kernel for spinless quarks.
