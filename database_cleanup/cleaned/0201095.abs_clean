The wedge states form an important subalgebra in the string field theory. Wereview and further investigate their various properties. We find in particulara novel expression for the wedge states, which allows to understand their starproducts purely algebraically. The method allows also for treating the matterand ghost sectors separately. It turns out, that wedge states with differentmatter and ghost parts violate the associativity of the algebra. We introduceand study also wedge states with insertions of local operators and show howthey are useful for obtaining exact results about convergence of leveltruncation calculations. These results help to clarify the issue of anomaliesrelated to the identity and some exterior derivations in the string fieldalgebra.
