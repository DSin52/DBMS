Title: Exact String-like Solutions of the Gauged Nonlinear O(3) Model

Authors: H.R. Vanaie and N. Riazi

Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures

We show that the least energy conditions in the gauged nonlinear sigma modelwith Chern-Simons term lead to exact soliton-like solutions which have the samefeatures as domain walls. We will derive and discuss the correspondingsolutions, and compute the total energy, charge, and spin of the resultingsystem.
