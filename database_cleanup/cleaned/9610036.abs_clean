Threshold amplitudes are considered for $n$-particle production in arbitraryscalar theory. It is found that, like in $\phi ^4$, leading-$n$ corrections tothe tree level amplitudes, being summed over all loops, exponentiate. Thisresult provides more evidence in favor of the conjecture on the exponentialbehavior of the multiparticle amplitudes.
