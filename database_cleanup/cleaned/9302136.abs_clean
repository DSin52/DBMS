A new way of solving the descent equations corresponding to the Wess-Zuminoconsistency conditions is presented. The method relies on the introduction ofan operator $\delta$ which allows to decompose the exterior space-timederivative $d$ as a $BRS$ commutator. The case of the Yang-Mills theories istreated in detail.
