proceedings of the 1997 Cargese school on "Strings, Branes and Dualties"N=8 supergravity has a rich spectrum of black holes charged under the 56 U(1)gauge fields of the theory. Duality predicts that the entropy of these blackholes is related to the quartic invariant of the E(7,7) group. We verify thisprediction in detail by constructing black holes that correspond tosupersymmetric bound states of 2-branes at angles and 6-branes. The generalbound state contains an arbitrary number of branes rotated relative to eachother, and we derive the condition for these rotations to preservesupersymmetry. The microscopic bound state degeneracy matches the black holeentropy in detail. The entire 56 charge spectrum of extremal black holes in N=8supergravity can be displayed as the orbit under duality of a five parametergenerating solution. We exhibit a new generating configuration consisting ofD3-branes at angles and discuss its entropy.
