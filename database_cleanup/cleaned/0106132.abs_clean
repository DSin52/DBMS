Title: Super Virasoro Ghost Algebra using the Conformal Ghosts

Authors: B. B. Deo

Comments: 6 pages latex

Superconformal ghost current generators of conformal dimension 3/2 areconstructed using the conformal ghosts and anticommuting infinite dimensionalgamma matrices of the Clifford algebra. The super-Virasoro algebra for theghosts in both the N.S. and R sectors are presented. The anomaly terms in bothcases are deduced using Jacobi identity.
