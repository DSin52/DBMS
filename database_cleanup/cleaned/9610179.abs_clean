We discuss some perturbative techniques suitable for the gauge-invarianttreatment of the scalar and tensor inhomogeneities of an anisotropic andhomogeneous background geometry whose spatial section naturally decomposes intothe direct product of two maximally symmetric Eucledian manifolds, describing ageneral situation of dimensional decoupling in which $d$ external dimensionsevolve (in conformal time) with scale factor $a(\eta)$ and $n$ internaldimensions evolve with scale factor $b(\eta)$. We analyze the growing modeproblem which typically arises in contracting backgrounds and we focus ourattention on the situation where the amplitude of the fluctuations not onlydepends on the external space-time but also on the internal spatialcoordinates. In order to illustrate the possible relevance of this analysis wecompute the gravity waves spectrum produced in some highly simplified model ofcosmological evolution and we find that the spectral amplitude, whose magnitudecan be constrained by the usual bounds applied to the stochastic gravity wavesbackgrounds, depends on the curvature scale at which the compactificationoccurs and also on the typical frequency of the internal excitations.
