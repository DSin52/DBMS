Confinement in non-Abelian gauge theories, such as QCD, is often explainedusing an analogy to type II superconductivity. In this analogy the existence ofthe ``Meissner'' effect for quarks with respect to the QCD vacuum is animportant element. Here we show that using the ideas of Abelian projection itis possible to arrive at an effective London equation from a non-Abelian gaugetheory. (London's equation gave a phenomenological description of the Meissnereffect prior to the Ginzburg-Landau or BCS theory of superconductors). TheAbelian projected gauge field acts as the E&M field in normalsuperconductivity, while the remaining non-Abelian components form a gluoncondensate which is described via an effective scalar field. This effectivescalar field plays a role similar to the scalar field in Ginzburg-Landautheory.
