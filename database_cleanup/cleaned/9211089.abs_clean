A new method for constructing flows between distinct Landau-Ginzburg theoriesat fixed central charge is presented. The essential ingredient of theconstruction is an enlarged moduli space obtained by adding theories with zerocentral charge. The flows involve only marginal directions hence they can beapplied to transitions between string vacua, in particular to the constructionof mirror pairs of string ground states described by RG fixed points of N=2supersymmetric Landau--Ginzburg theories. In contrast to previous methods thisnew construction of mirror theories does not depend on particular symmetries ofthe original theory.
