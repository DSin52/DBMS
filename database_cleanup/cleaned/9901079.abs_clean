Title: Holography in the Flat Space Limit

Authors: Leonard Susskind

Matrix theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence provide nonperturbativeholographic formulations of string theory. In both cases the finite N theoriescan be thought of as infrared regulated versions of flat space string theory inwhich removing the cutoff is equivalent to letting N go to infinity.In this paper we consider the nature of this limit. In both cases theholographic mapping becomes completely nonlocal. In matrix theory thiscorresponds to the growth of D0-brane bound states with N. For the AdS/CFTcorrespondence there is a similar delocalization of the holographic image of asystem as N increases. In this case the limiting theory seems to require anumber of degrees of freedom comparable to large N matrix quantum mechanics.
