It is pointed out that phase structures of gauge theories compactified onnon-simply connected spaces are not trivial. As a demonstration, an SU(2) gaugeHosotani, Higgs and coexisting phases. The critical radius and the order of thephase transitions are explicitly determined. A general discussion about phasestructures for small and large scales of compactified spaces is given. Theappearance of phase transitions suggests a GUT scenario in which the gaugehierarchy problem is replaced by a dynamical problem of how to stabilize aradius of a compactified space in close vicinity to a critical radius.
