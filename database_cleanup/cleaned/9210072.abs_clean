We discuss the non--perturbative formulation for $c \leq 1$ string theory.The field theory like formulation of topological and non--topological models ispresented. The integral representation for arbitrary $(p,q)$ solutions isderived which explicitly obeys $p-q$ duality of these theories. The exactsolutions to string equation and various examples are also discussed.
