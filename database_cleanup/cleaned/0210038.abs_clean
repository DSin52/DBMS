A new class of Weyl invariant backgrounds are presented in terms of themetric $G_{\mu\nu}$ and the anti-symmetric Kalb-Ramond fields $B_{\mu\nu}$. Theten-dimensional spacetime is a product of four-dimensional flat spacetime andcurved six-dimensional spacetime having nonvanishing Ricci tensors. Thenon-vanishing Kalb-Ramond field strengths cannot be written globally as $H=dB$,being of the monopole type. Nevertheless they define homogeneous spacetime withno singularity.
