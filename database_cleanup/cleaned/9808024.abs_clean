We investigate the non-perturbative equivalence of some heterotic/type IIdual pairs with N=2 supersymmetry. The perturbative heterotic scalar manifoldsare respectively SU(1, 1)/U(1) x SO(2, 2+NV)/ SO(2) x SO(2+NV) and SO(4, 4+NH)/SO(4) x SO(4+NH) for moduli in the vector multiplets and hypermultiplets. Themodels under consideration correspond, on the type II side, to self-mirrorCalabi-Yau threefolds with Hodge numbers h(1,1)= NV +3= h(2,1)= NH +3, whichare K3 fibrations. We consider three classes of dual pairs, with NV=NH=8, 4 and2. The models with h(1,1)=7 and 5 provide new constructions, while theh(1,1)=11, already studied in the literature, is reconsidered here.Perturbative R2-like corrections are computed on the heterotic side by using auniversal operator whose amplitude has no singularities in the (T,U) space, andcan therefore be compared with the type II side result. We point out severalproperties connecting K3 fibrations and spontaneous breaking of the N=4supersymmetry to N=2. As a consequence of the reduced S- and T- dualitysymmetries, the instanton numbers in these three classes are restricted tointegers, which are multiples of 2, 2 and 4, for NV=8, 4 and 2, respectively.
