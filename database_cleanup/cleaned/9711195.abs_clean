Title: Towards a String Formulation of Vortex Dynamics

Authors: Elsebeth Schroder (Bayreuth), Ola Tornkvist (Fermilab and DAMTP,

Cambridge)Comments: Talk presented by Ola Tornkvist, to appear in the proceedings of the

International Workshop on Solitons, their Properties, Dynamics, Interactions,and Applications in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, 20-26 July 1997. LaTeX, 5pagesPattern Formation and SolitonsWe derive an exact equation of motion for a non-relativistic vortex in two-and three-dimensional models with a complex field. The velocity is given interms of gradients of the complex field at the vortex position. We discuss theproblem of reducing the field dynamics to a closed dynamical system withnon-locally interacting strings as the fundamental degrees of freedom.
