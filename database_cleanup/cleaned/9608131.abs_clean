We present the N=4 superspace constraints for the two-dimensional (2d)off-shell (4,4) supergravity with the superfield strengths expressed in termsof a (4,4) twisted (scalar) multiplet TM-I, as well as the correspondingcomponent results, in a form suitable for applications. The constraints areshown to be invariant under the N=4 super-Weyl transformations, whose N=4superfield parameters form another twisted (scalar) multiplet TM-II. To solvethe constraints, we propose the Ansatz which makes the N=4 superconformalflatness of the N=4 supergravity curved superspace manifest. The locally (4,4)supersymmetric TM-I matter couplings, with the potential terms resulting fromspontaneous supersymmetry breaking, are constructed. We also find the full(4,4) superconformally invariant (improved) TM-II matter action. The latter canbe extended to the (4,4) locally supersymmetric Liouville action which issuitable for describing (4,4) supersymmetric non-critical strings.
