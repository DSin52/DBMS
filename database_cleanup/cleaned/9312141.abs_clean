Title: Infinite dimensional symmetry of corner transfer matrices

Comments: 20 pages.  Revision corrects problems with TeX caused by e-mail line

wrappingSystemsWe review some of the recent developments in two dimensional statisticalmechanics in which corner transfer matrices provide the vital link betweenthe physical system and the representation theory of quantum affine algebras.This opens many new possibilities, because the eigenstates may be describedusing the properties of q-vertex operators.
