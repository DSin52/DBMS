We investigate the collapse of a spherical shell of matter in an anti-deSitter space. We search for a holographic description of the collapsing shellin the boundary theory. It turns out that in the boundary theory it is possibleto find information about the radial size of the shell. The shell deforms thebackground spacetime, and the deformed background metric enters into the actionof a generic bulk field. As a consequence, the correlators of operatorscoupling to the bulk field are modified. By studying the analytic structure ofthe correlators, we find that in the boundary theory there are unstableexcitations ("shellons") whose masses are multiples of a scale set by theradius of the shell. We also comment on the relation between black holeformation in the bulk and thermalization in the boundary.
