In this paper, by using an analogy among {\it quantum mechanics}, {\itelectromagnetic beam optics in optical fibers}, and {\it charge particle beamdynamics}, we introduce the concept of {\it coherent states} for chargedparticle beams in the framework of the {\it Thermal Wave Model} (TWM). We givea physical meaning of the Gaussian-like coherent structures of charged particledistribution that are both naturally and artificially produced in anaccelerating machine in terms of the concept of coherent states widely used inquantum mechanics and in quantum optics. According to TWM, this can be done byusing a Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation for a complex function, the so-called{\it beam wave function} (BWF), whose squared modulus is proportional to thetransverse beam density profile, where Planck's constant and the time arereplaced by the transverse beam emittance and by the propagation coordinate,respectively. The evolution of the particle beam, whose initial BWF is assumedto be the simplest coherent state (ground-like state) associated with the beam,in an infinite 1-D quadrupole-like device with small sextupole and octupoleaberrations, is analytically and numerically investigated.
