We investigate the effects of the Chern-Simons coupling on the high energybehavior in the $(2+1)$-dimensional Chern-Simons QED with a four-Fermiinteraction. Using the $1/N$ expansion we discuss the Chern-Simons effects onthe critical four-Fermi coupling at $O(1/N)$ and the $\beta$ function aroundit. High-energy behavior of Green's functions is also discussed. By explicitcalculation, we find that the radiative correction to the Chern-Simons couplingvanishes at $O(1/N)$ in the broken phase of the dynamical parity symmetry. Weargue that no radiative corrections to the Chern-Simons term arise at higherorders in the $1/N$ expansion.
