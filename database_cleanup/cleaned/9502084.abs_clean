leading to the non-existence of an extremal black hole in the quantum theoryJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B355 (1995) 92-98

We consider static solutions of two dimensional dilaton gravity models as toylaboratories to address the question of the final fate of black holes. A nonperturbative correction to the CGHS potential term is shown to lead classicallyto an extremal black hole geometry, thus providing a plausible solution toHawking evaporation paradox. However, the full quantum theory does not admit anextremal solution.
