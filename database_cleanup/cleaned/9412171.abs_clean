Reducible off-shell anomalous gauge theories are studied in the framework ofan extended Field-Antifield formalism by introducing new variables associatedwith the anomalous gauge degrees of freedom. The Wess-Zumino term for thesetheories is constructed and new gauge invariances appear. The quantum effectsdue to the extra variables are considered.
