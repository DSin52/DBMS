We study some reparametrization invariant theories in context of theBRST-co-BRST quantization method. The method imposes restrictions on thepossible gauge fixing conditions and leads to well defined inner product statesthrough a gauge regularisation procedure. Two explicit examples are alsotreated in detail.
