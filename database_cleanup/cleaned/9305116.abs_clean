We exhibit string contributions to the $\nd{S}$ matrix relating in- and out-state density matrices that do not factorize as a product of $S$ and$S^\dagger$ matrices. They are associated with valley trajectories betweentopological defects on the string world sheet, that appear as quantumfluctuations in the space-time foam. Through their ultraviolet cut-offdependences these valleys cause non-Hamiltonian time evolution and suppressoff-diagonal entries in the density matrix at large times.
