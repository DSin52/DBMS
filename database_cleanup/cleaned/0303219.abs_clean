Title: Horizon Branes and Chiral Strings

Authors: Nuno Reis

Comments: 83 pages, 2 figures, M.Sc. thesis

In this thesis I present a new type of brane - H-brane - where the role oftime in String Theory is considered as a primary concept in the search forstill unknown black hole physics. Using the basic tools of boundary conformalfield theory, we describe the H-branes both in the open and closed stringchannels and examine how they fit naturally in the known D-brane moduli space.In particular we compute their Ishibashi states and quantize the system usingthe first order formalism. We find that the geometry associated to the targetnull coordinates is non-commutative.
