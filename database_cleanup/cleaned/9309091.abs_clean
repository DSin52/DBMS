Authors: P V Landshoff

Comments: 7 pages including one figure in pictex, DAMTP 93-55

Canonical quantisation gives a new and convenient finite-temperatureperturbation theory in covariant gauges, and solves the problem of thezero-frequency mode in the temporal gauge. [Talk at Workshop on Thermal FieldTheories and their Applications, Banff, August 1993]
