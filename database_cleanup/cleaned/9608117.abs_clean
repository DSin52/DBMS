Superunification underwent a major paradigm shift in 1984 wheneleven-dimensional supergravity was knocked off its pedestal by ten-dimensionalperturbative ten-dimensional superstrings have in their turn been superseded bya new non-perturbative theory called {\it $M$-theory}, which describessupermembranes and superfivebranes, which subsumes all five consistent stringtheories and whose low energy limit is, ironically, eleven-dimensionalsupergravity. In particular, six-dimensional string/string duality follows frommembrane/fivebrane duality by compactifying $M$-theory on $S^1/Z_2 \times K3$(heterotic/heterotic duality) or $S^1 \times K3$ (Type $IIA$/heteroticduality) or $S^1/Z_2 \times T^4$ (heterotic/Type $IIA$ duality) or $S^1 \timesT^4$ (Type $IIA$/Type $IIA$ duality).
