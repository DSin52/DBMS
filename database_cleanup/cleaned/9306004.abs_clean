We study bosons interacting with an abelian Chern-Simons field on Riemannsurfaces of genus $g>0$. It is shown that a singular gauge transformationbrings the hamiltonian to free form. The transformed wave functions furnish amulti-component representation of the braid group studied by Imbo andMarch-Russell. The construction constitutes a proof of the equivalence ofbosons coupled to a Chern-Simons field and anyons and generalizes the wellknown equivalence of the two pictures on the plane.
