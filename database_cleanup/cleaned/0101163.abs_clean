Fermions in D=4 self-dual Euclidean Taub-NUT space are investigated.Dirac-type operators involving Killing-Yano tensors of the Taub-NUT geometryare explicitly given showing that they anticommute with the standard Diracoperator and commute with the Hamiltonian as it is expected. They are connectedwith the hidden symmetries of the space allowing the construction of aconserved vector operator analogous to the Runge-Lenz vector of the Keplerproblem. This operator is written down pointing out its algebraic properties.
