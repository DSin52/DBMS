We examine the one-loop vacuum structure of an effective theory of gauginocondensation coupled to the dilaton for string models in which the gaugecoupling constant does not receive string threshold corrections. The newingredients in our treatment are that we take into account the one-loopcorrection to the dilaton K\"ahler potential and we use a formulation whichincludes a chiral field $H$ corresponding to the gaugino bilinear. We findthrough explicit calculation that supersymmetry in the Yang-Mills sector isbroken by gaugino condensation.The dilaton and $H$ field have masses on the order of the gaugino condensationscale independently of the dilaton VEV. Although the calculation performed hereis at best a model of the full gaugino condensation dynamics, the result showsthat the one-loop correction to the dilaton K\"ahler potential as well as thedetailed dynamics at the gaugino condensation scale may play an important rolein solving the dilaton runaway problem.
