We investigate both geometric and conformal field theoretic aspects of mirrorsymmetry on N=(4,4) superconformal field theories with central charge c=6. Ourapproach enables us to determine the action of mirror symmetry on (non-stable)singular fibers in elliptic fibrations of Z_N orbifold limits of K3. Theresulting map gives an automorphism of order 4,8, or 12, respectively, on thesmooth universal cover of the moduli space. We explicitly derive the geometriccounterparts of the twist fields in our orbifold conformal field theories. Theclassical McKay correspondence allows for a natural interpretation of ourresults.
