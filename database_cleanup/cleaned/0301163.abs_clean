Solitons and Duality, S. Paulo, July 2002. In JHEPThe generalized supersymmetries admitting abelian bosonic tensorial centralcharges are classified in accordance with their division algebra structure(over ${\bf R}$, ${\bf C}$, ${\bf H}$ or ${\bf O}$). It is shown in particularthat in D=11 dimensions, the $M$-superalgebra admits a consistent octonionicformulation, involving 52 real bosonic generators (in place of the 528 of thestandard $M$-superalgebra). The octonionic $M5$ (super-5-brane) sectorcoincides with the octonionic $M1$ and $M2$ sectors, while in the standardformulation these sectors are all independent. The octonionic conformal andsuperconformal $M$-algebras are explicitly constructed. They are respectivelygiven by the $Sp(8|{\bf O})$ ($OSp(1,8|{\bf O})$) (super)algebra ofoctonionic-valued (super)matrices, whose bosonic subalgebra consists of 232(and respectively 239) generators.
