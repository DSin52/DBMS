A generic F-theory compactification containing many D3 branes developsmultiple brane throats. The interaction of observers residing inside differentthroats involves tunneling suppression and, as a result, is very weak. Thissuggests a new mechanism for generating small numbers in Nature. Oneunification scale inside a shallow throat causes TeV-scale SUSY-breaking insidethe standard-model throat. Another application, inspired by nuclear-decay, isresiding near the standard model brane decays to an approximate CFT-state of alonger throat within a Hubble time. This suggests that most of the mass of theuniverse today could consist of CFT-matter and may soften structure formationat sub-galactic scales. The tunneling calculation demonstrates that thecoupling between two throats is dominated by higher dimensional modes andconsequently is much larger than a naive application of holography mightsuggest.
