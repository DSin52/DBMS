version to appear in EPJCWe present a unified approach to representations of quantum mechanics onnoncommutative spaces with general constant commutators of phase-spacevariables. We find two phases and duality relations among them in arbitrarydimensions. Conditions for physical equivalence of different representations ofa given system are analysed. Symmetries and classification of phase spaces arediscussed. Specially, the dynamical symmetry of a physical system isinvestigated. Finally, we apply our analyses to the two-dimesional harmonicoscillator and the Landau problem.
