We write down a local $CP_1$ model involving two gauge fields, which isexactly equivalent to the O(3) $\sigma$ model with the Hopf term. We impose the$CP_1$ constraint by using the gaussian representation of the delta function.For the coefficient of the Hopf term, $\theta = {\pi \over 2s}$, 2s being aninteger, we show that the resulting model is exactly equivalent to aninteracting theory of spin-$s$ fields. Thus we conjecture that there should bea fixed point in the spin-$s$ theory near which it is exactly equal to the$\sigma$ model.
