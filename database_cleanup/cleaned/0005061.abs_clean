The Penrose limit is generalized to show that, any leading order solution ofthe low-energy field equations in any one of the five string theories has aplane wave solution as a limit. This limiting procedure takes into account allthe massless fields that may arise and commutes with the T-duality so that anydual solution has again a plane wave limit. The scaling rules used in the limitare unique and stem from the scaling property of the D=11 supergravity action.Although the leading order solutions need not be exact or supersymmetric, theirplane wave limits always preserve some portion of the Poincare supersymmetryand solve the relevant field equations in all powers of the string tensionparameter. Further properties of the limiting procedure are discussed.
