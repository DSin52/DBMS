We study Chern-Simons theory with a complex G_C or a real G x G gauge groupon a manifold with boundary - this includes Lorentzian and Euclidean (anti-) deSitter (E/A)dS gravity for G=SU(2) or G=SL(2,R). We show that there is acanonical choice of boundary conditions that leads to an unambiguous, fullycovariant and gauge invariant, off-shell derivation of the boundary action - aG_C/G or G WZW model, coupled in a gauge invariant way to the boundary value ofthe gauge field. In particular, for (E/A)dS gravity, the boundary action is aWZW model with target space (E/A)dS_3, reminiscent of a worldsheet forworldsheet mechanism. We discuss in some detail the properties of the boundarytheories that arise and we confront our results with various relatedconstructions in the literature.
