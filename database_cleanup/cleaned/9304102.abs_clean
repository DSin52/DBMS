We propose two new realizations of the N=4, $\hat{c}=4$ superconformal systembased on the compact and non-compact versions of parafermionic algebras. Thetarget space interpretation of these systems is given in terms offour-dimensional target spaces with non-trivial metric and topology differentfrom the previously known four-dimensional semi-wormhole realization. Theproposed $\hat{c}=4$ systems can be used as a building block to constructperturbatively stable superstring solutions with covariantized target spacesupersymmetry around non-trivial gravitational and dilaton backgrounds.
