We show that D=4 Schwarzschild black holes can arise from a doublet ofEuclidean D3-antiD3 pairs embedded in D=10 Lorentzian spacetime. By startingfrom a D=10 type IIB supergravity description for the D3-antiD3 pairs andwrapping one of them over an external 2-sphere, we derive all vacuum solutionscompatible with the symmetry of the problem. Analysing under what condition aEuclidean brane configuration embedded in a Lorentzian spacetime can lead to atime-independent spacetime, enables us to single out the embedded D=4Schwarzschild spacetime as the unique solution generated by the D3-antiD3pairs. In particular we argue on account of energy-conservation thattime-independent solutions arising from isolated Euclidean branes require thosebranes to sit at event horizons. In combination with previous work thisself-dual brane-antibrane origin of the black hole allows for a microscopiccounting of its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Finally we indicate howHawking-radiation can be understood from the associated tachyon condensationprocess.
