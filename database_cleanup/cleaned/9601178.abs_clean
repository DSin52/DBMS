Title: Connections and Generalized Gauge Transformations

Comments: 64 pages, TeX, 1 figure. An alteration is made to one of the

The nonlinear SU(4) action on an $S^7$ bundle is appliedto the dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity andten-dimensional superstring theory to four dimensions. A principle, consistentwith higher-dimensional superstring theory, is suggested to explain the typesof gauge interactions that arise in the standard model based on the geometry ofthe internal symmetry spaces. It is shown why a Lie group structure is requiredfor vector bosons in pure gauge theories and that the application of divisionalgebras to force unification must begin with the fermions comprising theelementary particle multiplets of the standard model. A suggestion is made forestablishing a mechanism for the cancellation of anomalies within this approachto superstring theory.
