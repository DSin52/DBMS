It is stated in the literature that D-branes in the WZW-model associated withthe gluing condition J = - \bar{J} along the boundary correspond to branesfilling out the whole group volume. We show instead that the end-points of openstrings are rather bound to stay on `integer' conjugacy classes. In the case ofSU(2) level k WZW model we obtain k-1 two dimensional Euclidean D-branes andtwo D particles sitting at the points e and -e.
