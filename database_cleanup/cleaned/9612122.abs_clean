A new mechanism for symmetry breaking is proposed which naturally avoids theconstraints following from the usual theorems of symmetry breaking. In thecontext of super-symmetry, for example, the breaking may be consistent with avanishing vacuum energy. A 2+1 dimensional super-symmetric gauge field theoryis explicitly shown to break super-symmetry through this mechanism whilemaintaining a zero vacuum energy. This mechanism may provide a solution to twolong standing problems, namely, dynamical super-symmetry breaking and thecosmological constant problem.
