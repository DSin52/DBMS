We examine the constraints and the reality conditions that have to be imposedin the canonical theory of 4--d gravity formulated in terms of Ashtekarvariables. We find that the polynomial reality conditions are consistent withthe constraints, and make the theory equivalent to Einstein's, as long as theinverse metric is not degenerate; when it is degenerate, reality conditionscannot be consistently imposed in general, and the theory describes complexgeneral relativity.
