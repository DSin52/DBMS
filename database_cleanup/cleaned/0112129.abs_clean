We consider thorny spheres, that is 2-dimensional compact surfaces which areeverywhere locally isometric to a round sphere $S^2$ except for a finite numberof isolated points where they have conical singularities. We use thorny spheresto generate, from a spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein equations,new solutions which describe spacetimes pierced by an arbitrary number ofinfinitely thin cosmic strings radially directed. Each string produces an angledeficit proportional to its tension, while the metric outside the strings is alocally spherically symmetric solution. We prove that there can be arbitraryconfigurations of strings provided that the directions of the strings obey acertain equilibrium condition. In general this equilibrium condition can bewritten as a force-balance equation for string forces defined in a flat 3-spacein which the thorny sphere is isometrically embedded, or as a constraint on theproduct of holonomies around strings in an alternative 3-space that is flatexcept for the strings. In the case of small string tensions, the constraintequation has the form of a linear relation between unit vectors directed alongthe string axes.
