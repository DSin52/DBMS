The vacuum energies corresponding to massive Dirac fields with the boundaryconditions of the MIT bag model are obtained. The calculations are done withthe fields occupying the regions inside and outside the bag, separately. Therenormalization procedure for each of the situations is studied in detail, inparticular the differences occurring with respect to the case when the fieldextends over the whole space. The final result contains several constantsundergoing renormalization, which can be determined only experimentally. Thenon-trivial finite parts which appear in the massive case are found exactly,providing a precise determination of the complete, renormalized zero-pointenergy for the first time, in the fermionic case. The vacuum energy behaveslike inverse powers of the mass for large masses.
