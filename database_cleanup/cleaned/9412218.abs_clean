The operator ordering problem due to the quantization or regularizationambiguity in the Chern-Simons theory exists. However, we show that this can beavoided if we require Galilei covariance of the nonrelativistic AbelianChern-Simons theory even at the quantum level for the extended sources. Thecovariance can be recovered only by choosing some particular operator orderingsfor the generators of the Galilei group depending on the quantizationambiguities of the $gauge-matter$ commutation relation. We show that thedesired ordering for the unusual prescription is not the same as the well-knownnormal ordering but still satisfies all the necessary conditions. Furthermore,we show that the equations of motion can be expressed in a similar formregardless of the regularization ambiguity. This suggests that the differentregularization prescriptions do not change the physics. On the other hand, forthe case of point sources the regularization prescription is uniquelydetermined, and only the orderings, which are equivalent to the usual one, areallowed.
