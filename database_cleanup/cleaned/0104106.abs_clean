We study the noncommutative $\phi^4$ theory with spontaneously broken globalO(2) symmetry in 4 dimensions. We demonstrate the renormalizability at oneloop. This does not require any choice of ordering of the fields in theinteraction terms. It involves regulating the ultraviolet and infrareddivergences in a manner consistent with the Ward identities.
