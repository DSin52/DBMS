We study geometric engineering of Argyres-Douglas superconformal theoriesrealized by type IIB strings propagating in singular Calabi-Yau threefolds. Weuse this construction to count the degeneracy of light BPS states under smallperturbations away from the conformal point, by computing the degeneracy ofD3-branes wrapped around supersymmetric 3-cycles in the Calabi-Yau. We findfinitely many BPS states, the number of which depends on how this deformationis done, similarly to the degeneracy of kink solutions for the deformation ofN=2 Landau-Ginzburg superconformal theories in two dimensions. Also, someaspects of worldsheet theories near general Calabi-Yau singularities arediscussed.
