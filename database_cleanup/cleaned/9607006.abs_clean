Title: Eikonal Approach to Planck Scale Physics

Comments: Talk given at XVIII Conference of the Indian Association for General

Relativity and Gravitation, Madras, February 15-17, 1996. 15 pages, REVTeX,with 2 figures as a .tar.gz.uu fileWe consider gravitational scattering of point particles with Planckiancentre-of-mass energy and fixed low momentum transfers in the framework ofgeneral relativity and dilaton gravity. The geometry around the particles aremodelled by arbitrary black hole metrics of general relativity to calculate thescattering amplitudes. However, for dilaton gravity, this modelling can be done{\it only} by extremal black hole metrics. This is consistent with theconjecture that extremal black holes are elementary particles.
