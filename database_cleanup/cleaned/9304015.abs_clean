We calculate the partition functions of QCD in two dimensions on a cylinderand on a torus in the gauge $\partial_{0} A_{0} = 0$ by integrating explicitlyover the non zero modes of the Fourier expansion in the periodic time variable.The result is a one dimensional Kazakov-Migdal matrix model with eigenvalues ona circle rather than on a line. We prove that our result coincides with thestandard expansion in representations of the gauge group. This involves a nontrivial modular transformation from an expansion in exponentials of $g^2$ toone in exponentials of $1/g^2$. Finally we argue that the states of the $U(N)$or $SU(N)$ partition function can be interpreted as a gas of N free fermions,and the grand canonical partition function of such ensemble is given explicitlyas an infinite product.
