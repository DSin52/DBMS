We compute the propagator for massless and massive scalar fields in themetric of the pp-wave. The retarded propagator for the massless field is foundto stay confined to the surface formed by null geodesics. The algebraic form ofthe massive propagator is found to be related in a simple way to the form ofthe propagator in flat spacetime.
