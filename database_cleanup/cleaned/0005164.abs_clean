It has been recently shown that F-theory on K3 with background B fields (NSNSand RR 2-forms) is dual to the CHL string in 8 dimensions. In this paper, wereexamine this duality in terms of string junctions in type IIB string theory.It is in particular stressed that certain 7-brane configurations produce Spgauge groups in a novel way.
