Authors: Ian G Moss and Wade Naylor

Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures, JHEP LaTeX, with corrections

The effective action of the radion in the Randall-Sundrum model is analysed.Fine tunings are needed to obtain the observed mass hierarchy and an invisibleradion. since the kinetic terms are important for determining the radion mass,the finite quantum corrections from massless conformally coupled fermions areanalysed and found to vanish at one loop order.
