Title: Regular Representation of the Quantum Heisenberg Double $U_q(sl(2))$,

$Fun_{q}(SL(2))$ ($q$ is a root of unity)Comments: UUITP-- 27/1993

Pairing between the universal enveloping algebra $U_q(sl(2))$ and the algebraof functions over $SL_q(2)$ is obtained in explicit terms. The regularrepresentation of the quantum double is constructed and investigated. Thestructure of the root subspaces of the Casimir operator is revealed anddescribed in terms of $SL_q(2)$ elements.
