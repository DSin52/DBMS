The recently proposed loop representation, used previously to find exactsolutions to the quantum constraints of general relativity, is here used toquantize linearized general relativity. The Fock space of graviton states andits associated algebra of observables are represented in terms of functionalsof loops. The ``reality conditions'' are realized by an inner product that ischiral asymmetric, resulting in a chiral asymmetric ordering for theHamiltonian and in an asymmetric description of the left and right handedgravitons. This chirally asymmetric formulation depends on a splitting of thelinearized field into self-dual and anti-self dual parts rather than intopositive and negative frequency parts; as the former, but not the latter, ismeaningful away from flat backgrounds this is expected to be useful inconnecting the nonperturbative theory to the linearized theory. The formalismdepends on an arbitrary ``averaging'' function that controls certaindivergences, but does not appear in the final physical quantities. Inspite ofthese somewhat unusual features, the loop quntization presented here iscompletely equivalent to the standard quantization of linearized gravity.
