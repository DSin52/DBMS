Five dimensional geodesic equation is used to study the gravitational forceacted on a test particle in the bulk of the Randall-Sundrum two-branemodel.This force could be interpreted as the gravitational attraction frommatters on the two branes and may cause the model to be unstable. By analogywith star models in astrophysics, a fluid RS model is proposed in which thebulk is filled with a fluid and this fluid has an anisotropic pressure tobalance the gravity from the two branes. Thus a class of exact bulk solutionsis obtained which shows that any 4D Einstein solution with a perfect fluidsource can be embedded in $y=$ constant hypersurfaces in the bulk to form anequilibrium state of the brane model. By requiring a 4D effective curvature tohave a minimum, the compactification size of the extra dimension is discussed.
