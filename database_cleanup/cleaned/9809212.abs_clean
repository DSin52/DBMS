We study the classical and quantum motion of a relativistic charged particleon the spacetime produced by a global monopole. The self-potential, which ispresent in this spacetime, is considered as an external electrostaticpotential. We obtain classical orbits and quantum states for a spin-1/2 andspin-0 particles.
