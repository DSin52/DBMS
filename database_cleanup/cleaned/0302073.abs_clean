Title: Kaigorodov spaces and their Penrose limits

Authors: Christophe Patricot

Kaigorodov spaces arise, after spherical compactification, as near horizonlimits of M2, M5, and D3-branes with a particular pp-wave propagating in aworld volume direction. We show that the uncompactified near horizonconfigurations K\times S are solutions of D=11 or D=10 IIB supergravity whichcorrespond to perturbed versions of their AdS \times S analogues. We derive thePenrose-Gueven limits of the Kaigorodov space and the total spaces and analysetheir symmetries. An Inonu-Wigner contraction of the Lie algebra is shown tooccur, although there is a symmetry enhancement. We compare the results to thethe initial gravitational perturbation on the brane and its near horizongeometry remains after taking non-trivial Penrose limits, but seems todecouple. One particuliar limit yields a time-dependent homogeneous plane-wavebackground whose string theory is solvable, while in the other cases we findinhomogeneous backgrounds.
