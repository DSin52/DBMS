After adding auxiliary fields and integrating out the original variables, theYang-Mills action can be expressed in terms of local gauge invariant variables.This method reproduces the known solution of the two dimensional $SU(N)$theory. In more than two dimensions the action splits into a topological partand a part proportional to $\alpha_s$. We demonstrate the procedure for $SU(2)$in three dimensions where we reproduce a gravity-like theory. We discuss thefour dimensional case as well. We use a cubic expression in the fields as aspace-time metric to obtain a covariant Lagrangian. We also show how thefour-dimensional $SU(2)$ theory can be expressed in terms of a local actionwith six degrees of freedom only.
