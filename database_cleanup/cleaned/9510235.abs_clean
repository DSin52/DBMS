Self-dual gauge potentials admit supersymmetric couplings to higher-spinfields satisfying interacting forms of the first order Dirac--Fierz equation.The interactions are governed by conserved currents determined bysupersymmetry. These super-self-dual Yang-Mills systems provide on-shellsupermultiplets of arbitrarily extended super-Poincar\'e algebras; classicalconsistency not setting any limit on the extension N. We explicitly displayequations of motion up to the $N=6$ extension. The stress tensor, whichvanishes for the $N\le 3$ self-duality equations, not only gets resurrectedwhen $N=4$, but is then a member of a conserved multiplet of gauge-invarianttensors.
