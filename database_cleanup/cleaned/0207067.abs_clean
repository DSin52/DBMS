We consider the radial quantization of N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) in 4dimensions, i.e., N=4 SYM on a cylinder R times S^3. We construct thegenerators of superconformal symmetry in the case of U(N) gauge group,generalizing the earlier work by Nicolai et al. for U(1) gauge group. We studyhow these generators contract to the symmetry of pp-wave when they act on astate with large R-charge.
