We investigate an exactly marginal N=1 supersymmetric deformation of SU(N)N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory discovered by Leigh and Strassler. We usea matrix model to compute the exact superpotential for a further massivedeformation of the U(N) Leigh-Strassler theory. We then show how the exactsuperpotential and eigenvalue spectrum for the SU(N) theory follows by aprocess of integrating-in. We find that different vacua are related by anaction of the SL(2,Z) modular group on the bare couplings of the theoryextending the action of electric-magnetic duality away from the N=4 theory. Weperform non-trivial tests of the matrix model results against semiclassicalfield theory analysis. We also show that there are interesting points inparameter space where condensates can diverge and vacua disappear. Based on thematrix model results, we propose an exact elliptic superpotential to describethe theory compactified on a circle of finite radius.
