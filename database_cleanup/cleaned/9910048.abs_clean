Title: Non-Abelian Gerbes from Strings on a Branched Space-Time

Authors: Jussi Kalkkinen

As superstring solitons that carry Neuveu-Schwarz charge can be described interms of gerbes, one expects non-Abelian gerbes to appear e.g. in the exoticsix-dimensional world-volume theories of coinciding NS5 branes. We consideropen bosonic strings on a space-time that is branched in such a way that theB-field is provided with the same Lie algebra structure as the world-volumegauge field on a D-brane. These considerations motivate a generalization of thecocycle conditions and the transformation rules of an Abelian gerbe inhypercohomology. The resulting system incorporates in a natural way the NStwo-form, the RR gauge field, the Chan-Paton gauge field, the relevant gaugetransformations and the holonomies associated to Wilson surface observables.
