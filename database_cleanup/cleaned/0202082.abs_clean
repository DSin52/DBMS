Using differential renormalization, we calculate the complete two-pointfunction of the background gauge superfield in pure N=1 SupersymmetricYang-Mills theory to two loops. Ultraviolet and (off-shell) infrareddivergences are renormalized in position and momentum space respectively. Thisallows us to reobtain the beta function from the dependence on the ultravioletrenormalization scale in an infrared-safe way. The two-loop coefficient of thebeta function is generated by the one-loop ultraviolet renormalization of thequantum gauge field via nonlocal terms which are infrared divergent on shell.We also discuss the connection of the beta function to the flow of theWilsonian coupling.
