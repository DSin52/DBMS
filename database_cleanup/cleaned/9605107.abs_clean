Renormalization factors are most easily extracted by going to the masslesslimit of the quantum field theory and retaining only a single momentum scale.We derive factors and renormalized Green functions to all orders inperturbation theory for rainbow graphs and vertex (or scattering diagrams) atzero momentum transfer, in the context of dimensional renormalization, and weprove that the correct anomalous dimensions for those processes emerge in thelimit D -> 4.
