We propose a method to derive the low-energy efective action of QCD assumingthat the long-distance properties of strong interactions can be described by astring theory. We bypass the usual problems related to the existence of thetachyon and absence of the adequate Adler zero by using a sigma model approachwhere excitations above the correct (chirally non-invariant) QCD vacuum areincluded. Two-dimensional conformal invariance then implies the vanishing ofthe O(p^4) effective lagrangian coefficients. We discuss ways to go beyond thislimit.
