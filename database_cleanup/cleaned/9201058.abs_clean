We show that the generating functional for hard thermal loops with externalgluons in QCD is essentially given by the eikonal for a Chern-Simons gaugetheory. This action, determined essentially by gauge invariance arguments, alsogives an efficient way of obtaining the hard thermal loop contributions withoutthe more involved calculation of Feynman diagrams.
