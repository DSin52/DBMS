Various aspects of the four point function for scalar fields in conformallyinvariant theories are analysed. This depends on an arbitrary function of twoconformal invariants u,v. A recurrence relation for the function correspondingto the contribution of an arbitrary spin field in the operator productexpansion to the four point function is derived. This is solved explicitly intwo and four dimensions in terms of ordinary hypergeometric functions ofvariables z,x which are simply related to u,v. The operator product expansionanalysis is applied to the explicit expressions for the four point functionfound for free scalar, fermion and vector field theories in four dimensions.The results for four point functions obtained by using the AdS/CFTcorrespondence are also analysed in terms of functions related to thoseappearing in the operator product discussion.
