Starting from the QCD Lagrangian, we present the QCD Hamiltonian for nearlight cone coordinates. We study the dynamics of the gluonic zero modes of thisHamiltonian. The strong coupling solutions serve as a basis for the completeproblem. We discuss the importance of zero modes for the confinement mechanism.
