We analyse different approaches to the description of the quantum fieldtheory of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field defined in 1+1-dimensionalspace-time which describes the bosonized version of the massless Thirringmodel. These are (i) axiomatic quantum field theory, (ii) current algebra and(iii) path-integral. We show that the quantum field theory of a free massless(pseudo)scalar field defined on the class of Schwartz's test functions S_0(R^2)connects all these approaches. This quantum field theory is well-defined withinthe framework of Wightman's axioms and Wightman's positive definitenesscondition. The physical meaning of the definition of Wightman's observables onthe class of test functions from S_0(R^2) instead of S(R^2), as required byWightman's axioms, is the irrelevance of the collective zero-mode related tothe collective motion of the ``center of mass'' of the free massless(pseudo)scalar field, which can be deleted from the intermediate states ofcorrelation functions (Eur. Phys. J. C 24, 653 (2002)). In such a theory thecontinuous symmetry, induced by shifts of the massless (pseudo)scalar field, isspontaneously broken and there is a non-vanishing spontaneous magnetization.The obtained results are discussed in connection with Coleman's theoremasserting the absence of Goldstone bosons and spontaneously broken continuoussymmetry in quantum field theories defined in 1+1-dimensional space-time.
