We discuss an approach to compute two-particle scattering amplitudes forspinless particles colliding at Planckian centre-of-mass energies, withincreasing momentum transfer away from the eikonal limit. For electricallyneutral particles, the amplitude exhibits poles on the imaginary squared cmenergy axis at locations that are distinct from those appearing in the eikonallimit. For charged particles, electromagnetic and gravitational effects remaindecoupled for the eikonal situation as also the leading order (in momentumtransfer, or equivalently, the impact parameter) correction, but mixnon-trivially for higher orders.
