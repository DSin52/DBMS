We investigate the possibility of accommodating neutrino masses compatiblewith the MSW study of the Solar neutrino deficit within the minimalsupersymmetric Standard Model. The ``gravity-induced'' seesaw mechanism basedon an interplay of nonrenormalizable and renormalizable terms in thesuperpotential allows neutrino masses $m_\nu\propto m_u^2/M_I$, with $m_u$ thecorresponding quark mass and $M_I\simeq 4\times10^{11}$ GeV, while at the sametime ensuring the grand desert with the gauge coupling unification at$M_U\simeq 2\times10^{16}$ GeV. The proposed scenario may be realized in aclass of string vacua, {\it i.e.,} large radius ($R^2/\alpha '={\cal O}(20)$)$(0,2)$ Calabi-Yau spaces. In this case $M_U^2=M_C^2/{\cal O} (2R^2/\alpha')$and $M_I= {\cal O}(e^{-R^2/\alpha'})M_C$. Here $M_C=g\times 5.2\times10^{17}$GeV is the scale of the tree level (genus zero) gauge coupling ($g$)unification.
