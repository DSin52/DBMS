Title: The Cosmological Constant of One-Dimensional Matter Coupled Quantum

Gravity is QuantizedAuthors: Jan Govaerts

Comments: 1+20 pages

Coupling any interacting quantum mechanical system to gravity in onedimension requires the cosmological constant to belong to the matter energyspectrum and thus to be quantized, even though the gravity sector is free ofany quantum dynamics, while physical states are also confined to the subspaceof matter quantum states whose energy coincides with the cosmological constantvalue. These general facts are illustrated through some simple examples. Thephysical projector quantization approach readily leads to the correctrepresentation of such systems, whereas other approaches relying on gaugefixing methods are often plagued by Gribov problems in which case thequantization rule is not properly recovered. Whether such a quantization of thecosmological constant as well as the other ensuing consequences in terms ofphysical states extend to higher dimensional matter-gravity coupled quantumsystems is clearly a fascinating open issue.
