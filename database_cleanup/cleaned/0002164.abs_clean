In this note we elaborate on various five dimensional contributions to theeffective 4D cosmological constant in brane systems. In solutions withvanishing 5D cosmological constant we describe a non-local mechanism ofcancellation of vacuum energy between the brane and the singularities. Wecomment on a hidden fine tuning which is implied by this observation.
