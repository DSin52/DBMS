We present a new perturbative approach to QCD based on the use of quarkcomposites with hadronic quantum numbers as fundamental variables. We apply itto the case of the nucleons by performing a nonlinear change of variables inthe Berezin integral which defines the partition function of QCD. The nucleoncomposites are thereby assumed as new integration variables. We evaluate thejacobian and certain transformation functions which appear in the change ofvariables. We show that the free action of the nucleon composites is the Diracaction, and we evaluate the first perturbative contributions to theirelectroweak effective action, which turn out to be a pure renormalization. Ourexpansion is compatible with a perturbative as well as nonperturbative regimeof the gluons and it has the characteristic feature that the confinement of thequarks is buit in.
