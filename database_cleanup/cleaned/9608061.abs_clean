Title: Algebraic Structure of S-Theory

Comments: Latex, 8 pages, talks at 2nd Sakharov conf. and Strings'96 conf

The algebraic structure of S-Theory and its representations are described.This structure includes up to 13 hidden dimensions. It implies the existence ofan SO(10,2) covariant supergravity theory as a limit of the secret theorybehind string theory. The black hole entropy is invariant under transformationsincluding the 11th and 12th dimensions. The discussion includes generalizationinto curved spacetime via various contractions of the superalgebras OSp(1/32),OSp(1/64) etc..
