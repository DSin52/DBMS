Invertible universal R-matrices of quantum Lie algebras do not exist at rootsof unity. There exist however quotients for which intertwiners of tensorproducts of representations always exist, i.e. R-matrices exist in therepresentations. One of these quotients, which is finite dimensional, has acondition are the different quotients of U_q(sl(2)) (Hopf)-equivalent? In thecase when they are equivalent, the universal R-matrix of one can be transformedinto a universal R-matrix of the other. We prove that this happens only whenq^4=1, and we explicitly give the expressions for the automorphisms and for thetransformed universal R-matrices in this case.
