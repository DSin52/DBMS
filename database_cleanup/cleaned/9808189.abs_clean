Title: Ground state in gluodynamics and $q\bar{q}$ potential

Comments: 9 pages, Latex, based on talks given at 10th International Seminar on

High Energy Physics "Quarks'98", Suzdal, Russia, May 18--24, 1998 and atWorkshop on "Instantons and Monopoles in the QCD Vacuum", Copenhagen,Denmark, June 22--27, 1998Static color charges in Yang-Mills theory are considered in the Schr\"odingerpicture. Stationary states containing color sources, interquark potential andconfinement criterion are discussed within the framework based on integrationover gauge transformations which projects the vacuum wave functional on thespace of physical, gauge-invariant states.
