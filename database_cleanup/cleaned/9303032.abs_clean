We generalize the results of a previous paper by one of the authors to show arelationship among a class of string solutions through $O(\tilde d, \tilde d)$transformations. The results are applied to a rotating black hole solution ofthree dimensional general relativity discussed recently.  We extend the blackhole solution to string theory and show its connection with the threedimensional black string with nonzero momentum through an $O(\tilde d, \tilded)$ transformation of the above type.
