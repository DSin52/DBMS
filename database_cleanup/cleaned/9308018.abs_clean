We construct new heterotic string backgrounds which are analogous tosuperstring solutions corresponding to coset models but are not simply the`embeddings'of the latter. They are described by the (1,0) supersymmetricextension of the $G/H$ chiral gauged WZNW models. The `chiral gauged' WZNWaction differs from the standard gauged WZNW action by the absence of the$A\bar A$-term (and thus is not gauge invariant in the usual sense) but canstill be expressed as a combination of WZNW actions and is conformal invariant.We explain a close relation between gauged and chiral gauged WZNW models andprove that in the case of the abelian $H$ the $G/H$ chiral gauged theory isequivalent to a particular $(G\times H)/H$ gauged WZNW theory. In contrast tothe gauged WZNW model, the chiral gauged one admits a (1,0) supersymmetricextension which is consistent at the quantum level. Integrating out the $2d$gauge field we determine the exact (in $\alpha'$) form of the couplings of thecorresponding heterotic sigma model. While in the bosonic (superstring) casesall the fields depend (do not depend) non-trivially on $\alpha'$ here themetric receives only one $O(\alpha')$ correction while the antisymmetric tensorand the dilaton remain semiclassical. As a simplest example, we discuss thebasic $D=3$ solution which is the heterotic string counterpart of the `blackstring' $SL(2,R) \times R/ R $ background.
