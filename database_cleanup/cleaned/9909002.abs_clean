Title: Parafermionic and Generalized Parafermionic Algebras

Authors: Dennis Bonatsos, C. Daskaloyannis and K. Kanakoglou

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX. Presented at the International Conference on

Mathematical Physics (Istanbul 1997). To appear in the ProceedingsThe general properties of the ordinary and generalized parafermionic algebrasare discussed. The generalized parafermionic algebras are proved to bepolynomial algebras. The ordinary parafermionic algebras are shown to beconnected to the Arik-Coon oscillator algebras.
