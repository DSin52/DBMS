Title: Manifestation of additional dimensions of space-time in mesoscopic

systemsAuthors: A.F. Andreev

Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures; Corrected typos

EffectWe note that the existence of physical states which are coherentsuperpositions of states with even and odd numbers of fermions means theexistence, together with x,y,z,t, of additional spinor dimensions ofspace-time. A system with variable number of electrons is described in whichsuch superpositions are realized. Experiments with mesoscopic condensed mattersystems are suggested which generalize the experiment of Nakamura et al. andmay provide direct observation of such superpositions and, thereby, justify thereality of a superspace with additional spinor dimensions introduced in quantumfield theory to account for supersymmetry. The nature of additional dimensionsof space-time is elucidated for nonrelativistic systems.
