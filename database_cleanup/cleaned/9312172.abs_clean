Classical solutions describing charged dilaton black holes accelerating in abackground magnetic field have recently been found. They include the Ernstmetric of the Einstein-Maxwell theory as a special case. We study the extremallimit of these solutions in detail, both at the classical and quantum levels.It is shown that near the event horizon, the extremal solutions reduceprecisely to the static extremal black hole solutions. For a particular valueof the dilaton coupling, these extremal black holes are five dimensionalKaluza-Klein monopoles. The euclidean sections of these solutions can beinterpreted as instantons describing the pair creation of extremal blackholes/Kaluza-Klein monopoles in a magnetic field. The action of theseinstantons is calculated and found to agree with the Schwinger result in theweak field limit. For the euclidean Ernst solution, the action for the extremalsolution differs from that of the previously discussed wormhole instanton bythe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. However, in many cases quantum correctionsbecome large in the vicinity of the black hole, and the precise description ofthe creation process is unknown.
