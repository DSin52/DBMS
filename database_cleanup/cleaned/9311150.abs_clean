Title: Representations and Q-Boson Realization of the Algebra of Functions on

the Quantum Group GLq(N)Authors: V. Karimipour

Comments: 20 PAGES

We present a detailed study of the representations of the algebra offunctions on the quantum group $ GL_q(n) $. A q-analouge of the root system isconstructed for this algebra which is then used to determine explicit matrixrepresentations of the generators of this algebra. At the end a q-bosonrealization of the generators of $ GL_q(n) $ is given.
