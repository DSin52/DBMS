Title: Solvable Lie Algebras, BPS Black Holes and Supergravity Gaugings

Theory, Susy, Unification held in Neuchatel, September 1997Journal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 47 (1999) 173-181

In this talk I review both accomplished results and work in progress on theuse of solvable Lie algebras as an intrinsic algebraic characterization of thescalar field sector of M--theory low energy effective lagrangians. Inparticular I review the application of these techniques in obtaining the mostgeneral form of BPS black hole solutions.
