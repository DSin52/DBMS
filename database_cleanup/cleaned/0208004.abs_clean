Title: A unitary scenario for particle-black hole scattering?

The process of particle capture by an extremal charged black hole followed byHawking radiation is believed not to preserve unitarity at one-loop level. Inthis paper we point out that the above standard picture can be altered due tobackreaction effects. In the semiclassical approximation, and for the speciallow-energy particle-hole scattering considered, the corrected Hawking radiationseems compatible with unitarity.
