Polytechnique in Palaiseau, Palaiseau, France, May 15-19, 1995A discussion of the number of degrees of freedom, and their dynamicalproperties, in higher-derivative gravitational theories is presented. Thecomplete non-linear sigma model for these degrees of freedom is exhibited usingthe method of auxiliary fields. As a by-product we present a consistentnon-linear coupling of a spin-2 tensor to gravitation. It is shown thatnon-vanishing $(C_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta})^{2}$ terms arise in $N=1$, $D=4$superstring Lagrangians due to one-loop radiative corrections with light fieldinternal lines.
