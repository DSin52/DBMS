We consider configurations of Neveu-Schwarz fivebranes, Dirichlet fourbranesand an orientifold sixplane in type IIA string theory. Upon lifting theconfiguration to M-theory and proposing a description of how to include theeffects of the orientifold sixplane we derive the curves describing the Coulombbranch of N=2 gauge theories with orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups,product gauge groups of the form SU(k_1)...SU(k_i) x SO(N) andSU(k_1)...SU(k_i) x Sp(N). We also propose new curves describing theories withunitary gauge groups and matter in the symmetric or antisymmetricrepresentation.
