We investigate systematically the asymptotic dynamics and symmetries of allthree-dimensional extended AdS supergravity models. First, starting from theChern-Simons formulation, we show explicitly that the (super)anti-de Sitterboundary conditions imply that the asymptotic symmetry algebra is the extendedsuperconformal algebra with quadratic nonlinearies in the currents. We thenderive the super-Liouville action by solving the Chern-Simons theory and obtaina realization of the superconformal algebras in terms of super-Liouvillefields. Finally, we discuss the possible periodic conditions that can beimposed on the generators of the algebra and generalize the spectral flowanalysed previously in the context of the $N$-extended linear superconformalalgebras with $N \leq 4$. The $(2+1)$-AdS/2-CFT correspondence sheds a newlight on the properties of the nonlinear superconformal algebras. It alsoprovides a general and natural interpretation of the spectral flow.
