We study chiral symmetry breaking in quenched QED$_4$, using a vertex Ansatzrecently proposed by Curtis and Pennington. Bifurcation analysis is employed toestablish the existence of a critical coupling and to estimate its value. Themain results are in qualitative agreement with the ladder approximation, thenumerical changes being minor.
