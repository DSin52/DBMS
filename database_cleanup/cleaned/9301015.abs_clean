We suggest how to derive the exact (all order in $\a'$) expressions for thebackground fields for string solutions corresponding to gauged WZW modelsdirectly at the $2d$ field theory level. One is first to replace the classicalgauged WZW action by the quantum effective one and then to integrate out thegauge field. We find the explicit expression for the gauge invariant non-localeffective action of the gauged WZW model. The two terms (corresponding to thegroup and subgroup) which appear with the same coefficients in the classicalaction get different $k$-dependent coefficients in the effective one. Theprocedure of integrating out the gauge field is considered in detail for the$SL(2,R)/U(1)$ model and the exact expressions for the $D=2$ metric and thedilaton (originally found in the conformal field theory approach) arereproduced.
