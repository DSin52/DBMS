We consider the deformation of the Schwarzschild solution in generalrelativity due to spherically symmetric quantum fluctuations of the metric andthe matter fields. In this case, the 4D theory of gravity with Einstein actionreduces to the effective two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We have found thatthe Schwarzschild singularity at $r=0$ is shifted to the finite radius $r_{min}\sim r_{Pl}$, where the scalar curvature is finite, so that the space-timelooks regular and consists of two asymptotically flat sheets glued at thehypersurface of constant radius.
