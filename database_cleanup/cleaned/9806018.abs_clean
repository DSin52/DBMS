We compare the amplitudes for the long-distance scattering of three gravitonsin eleven dimensional supergravity and matrix theory at finite N. We show thatthe leading supergravity term arises from loop contributions to the matrixtheory effective action that are not required to vanish by supersymmetry. Weevaluate in detail one type of diagram---the setting sun with only massivepropagators---reproducing the supergravity behavior.
