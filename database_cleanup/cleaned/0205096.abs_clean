We study the dynamics of type I strings on Melvin backgrounds, with a singleor multiple twisted two-planes. We construct two inequivalent types oforientifold models that correspond to (non-compact) irrational versions ofScherk-Schwarz type breaking of supersymmetry. In the first class of vacua,D-branes and O-planes are no longer localized in space-time but are smearedalong the compact Melvin coordinate with a characteristic profile. On the otherhand, the second class of orientifolds involves O-planes and D-branes that areboth rotated by an angle proportional to the twist. In case of ``multipleMelvin spaces'', some amount of supersymmetry is recovered if the planes aretwisted appropriately and part of the original O-planes are transmuted into newones. The corresponding boundary and crosscap states are determined.
