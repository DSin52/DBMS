We study the dimensionality manifested in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We showthat the dimensionality as expressed by the high temperature behavior of asystem has a holographic nature also at the quantum level. The emergence of theAdS black hole as a master field at high temperature leads to the screening ofthe extra dimensions in its excluded volume.
