I identify the class of even-dimensional conformal field theories that ismost similar to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In this class theformula, elaborated recently, for the irreversibility of therenormalization-group flow applies also to massive flows. This implies aprediction for the ratio between the coefficient of the Euler density in thetrace anomaly (charge a) and the stress-tensor two-point function (charge c).More precisely, the trace anomaly in external gravity is quadratic in the Riccitensor and the Ricci scalar and contains a unique central charge. I check theprediction in detail in four, six and eight dimensions, and then in arbitraryeven dimension.
