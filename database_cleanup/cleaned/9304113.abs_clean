We examine the quantization of the motion of two charged vortices in aGinzburg--Landau theory for the fractional quantum Hall effect recentlyproposed by the first two authors. The system has two second-class constraintswhich can be implemented either in the reduced phase space orDirac-Gupta-Bleuler formalism. Using the intrinsic formulation of statistics,we show that these two ways of implementing the constraints are inequivalentunless the vortices are quantized with conventional statistics; eitherfermionic or bosonic.
