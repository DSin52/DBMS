An explicit holographic correspondence between $AdS$ bulk and boundaryquantum states is found in the form of a one to one mapping between scalarfield creation/annihilation operators. The mapping requires the introduction ofregulating mass in the boundary theory corresponds to a large momentum cutoffin the bulk. In the massless (conformal) limit of the boundary theory themapping covers the whole field spectrum of both theories. The mapping stronglydepends on the discretization of the field spectrum of compactified $AdS$ spacein Poincare coordinates.
