We explicitly evaluate the low energy coupling $F_g$ in a $d=4,\CN=2$compactification of the heterotic string. The holomorphic piece of thisexpression provides the information not encoded in the holomorphic anomalyequations, and we find that it is given by an elementary polylogarithm withindex $3-2g$, thus generalizing in a natural way the known results for $g=0,1$.The heterotic model has a dual Calabi-Yau compactification of the type IIstring. We compare the answer with the general form expected fromcurve-counting formulae and find good agreement. As a corollary of thiscomparison we predict some numbers of higher genus curves in a specificCalabi-Yau, and extract some intersection numbers on the moduli space of genus$g$ Riemann surfaces.
