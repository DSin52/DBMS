Authors: Daniela Bigatti and Leonard Susskind

Comments: LaTex, 37 pages + 20 figures in .eps format (embedded in the paper)

These TASI lectures review the Holographic principle. The first lecturedescribes the puzzle of black hole information loss that led to the idea ofBlack Hole Complementarity and subsequently to the Holographic Principleitself. The second lecture discusses the holographic entropy bound in generalspace-times. The final two lectures are devoted to the ADS/CFT duality as aspecial case of the principle. The presentation is self contained andemphasizes the physical principles. Very little technical knowledge of stringtheory or supergravity is assumed.
