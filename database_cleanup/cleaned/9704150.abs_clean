A new discretisation of a doubled, i.e. BF, version of the pure abelianChern-Simons theory is presented. It reproduces the continuum expressions forthe topological quantities of interest in the theory, namely the partitionfunction and correlation function of Wilson loops. Similarities with freespinor field theory are discussed which are of interest in connection withlattice fermion doubling.
