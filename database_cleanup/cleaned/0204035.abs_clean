The text is an essentially self-contained introduction to four-dimensionalN=1 supergravity, including its couplings to super Yang-Mills and chiral mattermultiplets, for readers with basic knowledge of standard gauge theories andgeneral relativity. Emphasis is put on showing how supergravity fits in thegeneral framework of gauge theories and how it can be derived from a tensorGauge symmetries in the jet space approach, 3. D=4, N=1 pure supergravity, 4.Tensor calculus for standard gauge theories, 5. Off-shell formulations of D=4,N=1 supergravity with matter, A. Lorentz algebra, spinors, Grassmann parity, B.Explicit verification of local supersymmetry.
