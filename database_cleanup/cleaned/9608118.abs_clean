The self-duality of Dirichlet $3$-brane action under the $SL(2,R)$ dualitytransformation of type IIB superstring theory is shown in the Hamiltonian formof the path integral for the partition function by performing the directintegration with respect to the boundary gauge field. Through the integrationin the phase space the canonical momentum conjugate to the boundary gauge fieldcan be effectively replaced by the dual gauge field.
