We develop a superfield formalism for N=4 superconformal two-dimensionalfield theory. A list is presented of minimal free superfields, i.e. ofmultiplets containing four bosons and four fermions. We show that thesuper-Poincar\'e algebra of the six-dimensional superstring in the light-conegauge is essentially equivalent to a local N=4 superconformal symmetry, andoutline the construction of octonionic superconformal field theory.
