In two-dimensional space-time, point particles can experience a geometric,dimension-specific gravity force, which modifies the usual geodesic equation ofmotion and provides a link between the cosmological constant and the vacuum$\theta$-angle. The description of such forces fits naturally into a gaugetheory of gravity based on the extended Poincar\'e group, {\it i.e.\/}``string-inspired'' dilaton gravity.
