Authors: Michal Fabinger and John McGreevy

We study string theory on a non-singular time-dependent orbifold of flatspace, known as the `null-brane'. The orbifold group, which involves onlyspace-like identifications, is obtained by a combined action of a null Lorentztransformation and a constant shift in an extra direction. In the limit wherethe shift goes to zero, the geometry of this orbifold reproduces an orbifoldwith a light-like singularity, which was recently studied by Liu, Moore andSeiberg (hep-th/0204168). We find that the backreaction on the geometry due toa test particle can be made arbitrarily small, and that there are scatteringprocesses which can be studied in the approximation of a constant background.We quantize strings on this orbifold and calculate the torus partitionfunction. We construct a basis of states on the smooth orbifold whose treelevel string interactions are nonsingular. We discuss the existence of physicalmodes in the singular orbifold which resolve the singularity. We also describeanother way of making the singular orbifold smooth which involves a sandwichpp-wave.
