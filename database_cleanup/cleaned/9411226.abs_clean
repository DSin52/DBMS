We study $\l\f^4$ theory using an environmentally friendly finite-temperaturerenormalization group. We derive flow equations, using a fiducial temperatureas flow parameter, develop them perturbatively in an expansion free fromultraviolet and infrared divergences, then integrate them numerically from zeroto temperatures above the critical temperature. The critical temperature, atwhich the mass vanishes, is obtained by integrating the flow equations and isdetermined as a function of the zero-temperature mass and coupling. Wecalculate the field expectation value and minimum of the effective potential asfunctions of temperature and derive some universal amplitude ratios whichconnect the broken and symmetric phases of the theory. The latter are found tobe in good agreement with those of the three-dimensional Ising model obtainedfrom high- and low-temperature series expansions.
