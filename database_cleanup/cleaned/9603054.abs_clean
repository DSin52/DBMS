In this paper, we present a parity-preserving QED3 with spontaneous breakingof a local U(1)-symmetry. The breaking is accomplished by a potential of the\vf^6-type. It is shown that a net attractive interaction appears in theM{\o}ller scattering (s and p-wave scattering between two electrons) asmediated by the gauge field and a Higgs scalar. This might favour apair-condensation mechanism.
