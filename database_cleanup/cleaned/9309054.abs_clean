An alternative perturbative expansion in quantum mechanics which allows afull expression of the scaling arbitrariness is introduced. This expansion isexamined in the case of the anharmonic oscillator and is conveniently resummedusing a method which consists in introducing an energy cut-off that iscarefully removed as the order of the expansion is increased. We illustratethis technique numerically by computing the asymptotic behavior of the groundstate energy of the anharmonic oscillator for large couplings, and show how theexploitation of the scaling arbitrariness substantially improves theconvergence of this perturbative expansion.
