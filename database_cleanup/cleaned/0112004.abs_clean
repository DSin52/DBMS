We apply the coset character identities (generalization of Jacobi's abstruseidentity) to compact and noncompact Gepner models. In the both cases, we provethat the partition function actually vanishes due to the spacetimesupersymmetry. In the case of the compact models and discrete parts of thenoncompact models, the partition function includes the expected vanishingfactor. But the character identities used to the continuous part of thenoncompact models suggest that these models have twice as many supersymmetry asexpected. This fact is an evidence for the conjecture that the holographicallydual of the string theory on an actually singular Calabi-Yau manifold is asuper CONFORMAL field theory. The extra SUSY charges are interpreted as thesuperconformal S generators.
