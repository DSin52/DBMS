The N=1 self-dual supergravity has SL(2,C) and the left-handed and rightangular-momentum and the supercharges. The model possesses also the invarianceunder the general translation transforms and this invariance leads to theenergy-momentum. All the definitions are generally covariant . As the SU(2)charges and the energy-momentum we obtained previously constituting the3-Poincare algebra in the Ashtekar's complex gravity, the SU(2) charges, thesupercharges and the energy-momentum here also restore the super-Poincarealgebra, and this serves to support the reasonableness of theirinterpretations.
