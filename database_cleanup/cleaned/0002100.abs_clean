We study the type II superstring theory on the background $\br^{d-1,1}\timesX_n$, where $X_n$ is a Calabi-Yau $n$-fold ($2n+d=10$) with an isolatedsingularity, by making use of the holographically dual description proposed byGiveon-Kutasov-Pelc (hep-th/9907178). We compute the toroidal partitionfunctions for each of the cases $d=6,4,2$, and obtain manifestly modularinvariant solutions classified by the standard $A-D-E$ series corresponding tothe type of singularities on $X_n$. Partition functions of these modularinvariants all vanish due to theta function identities and are consistent withthe presence of space-time supersymmetry.
