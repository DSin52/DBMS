We explore some of the global aspects of duality transformations in StringTheory and Field Theory. We analyze in some detail the equivalence of dualmodels corresponding to different topologies at the level of the partitionfunction and in terms of the operator correspondence for abelian duality. Weanalyze the behavior of the cosmological constant under these transformations.We also explore several examples of non-abelian duality where the classicalbackground interpretation can be maintained for the original and the dualtheories. In particular we construct a non-abelian dual of $SL(2,R)$ whichturns out to be a three-dimensional black hole
