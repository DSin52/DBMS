We show that the higher order derivative $\alpha^{'}$ corrections to the DBIand Chern-Simon action is derived from non-commutativity in the Seiberg-Wittenlimit, and is shown to agree with Wyllard's (hep-th/0008125) result, asconjectured by Das et al., (hep-th/0106024). In calculating the corrections, wehave expressed $\hat F$ in terms F, $\hat A$ in terms of A up to order ${\calO}(A^3)$, and made use of it.
