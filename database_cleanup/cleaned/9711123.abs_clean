A non-relativistic version of the 2+1 dimensional gauged Chern-Simons O(3)sigma model, augmented by a Maxwell term, is presented and shown to supporttopologically stable static self-dual vortices. Exactly like their counterpartsof the ungauged model, these vortices are shown to exhibit Hall behaviour intheir dynamics.
