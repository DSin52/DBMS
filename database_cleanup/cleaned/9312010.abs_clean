We show how to relate the parafermions that occur in the $W_3$ string to thestandard construction of parafermions. This result is then used to show thatone of the screening charges that occurs in parafermionic theories is preciselythe non-trivial part of the $W_3$ string BRST charge. A way of generalizingthis pattern for a $W_N$ string is explained. This enables us to construct thefull BRST charge for a $W_{2,N}$ string and to prove the relation of such astring to the algebra $W_{N-1}$ for arbitrary $N$, We also show how tocalculate part of the BRST charge for a $W_N$ string, and we explain how ourmethod might be extended to obtain the full BRST charge for such a string.
