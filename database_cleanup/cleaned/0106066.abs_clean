Title: Uniqueness of Inverse Scattering Problem in Local Quantum Physics

Comments: 13 pages tcilatex

It is shown that the a Bisognano-Wichmann-Unruh inspired formulation of localquantum physics which starts from wedge-localized algebras, leads to auniqueness proof for the scattering problem. The important mathematical tool isthe thermal KMS aspect of localization and its strengthening by the requirementof crossing symmetry for generalized formfactors.
