Title: SU(N) Matrix Difference Equations and a Nested Bethe Ansatz

Authors: H. Babujian, M. Karowski and A. Zapletal

Comments: 18 pages, LaTeX

A system of SU(N)-matrix difference equations is solved by means of a nestedversion of a generalized Bethe Ansatz, also called "off shell" Bethe Ansatz.The highest weight property of the solutions is proved. (Part I of a series ofarticles on the generalized nested Bethe Ansatz and difference equations.)
