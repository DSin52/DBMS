Irreducible sigma models, i.e. those for which the partition function doesnot factorise, are defined on Riemannian spaces with irreducible holonomygroups. These special geometries are characterised by the existence ofcovariantly constant forms which in turn give rise to symmetries of thesupersymmetric sigma model actions. The Poisson bracket algebra of thecorresponding currents is a W-algebra. Extended supersymmetries arise asspecial cases.
