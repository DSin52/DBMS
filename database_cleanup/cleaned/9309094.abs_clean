The nonlinear structures in 2D quantum gravity coupled to the $(q+1,q)$minimal model are studied in the Liouville theory to clarify the factorizationand the physical states. It is confirmed that the dressed primary statesoutside the minimal table are identified with the gravitational descendants.Using the discrete states of ghost number zero and one we construct thecurrents and investigate the Ward identities which are identified with the Wand the Virasoro constraints. As nontrivial examples we derive the $L_0$, $L_1$and $W_{-1}^{(3)}$ equations exactly. $L_n$ and $W^{(k)}_n$ equations are alsodiscussed. We then explicitly show the decoupling of the edge states $O_j~(j=0~ {\rm mod}~ q) $. We consider the interaction theory perturbed by thecosmological constant $O_1$ and the screening charge $S^+ =O_{2q+1}$. Theformalism can be easily generalized to potential models other than thescreening charge.
