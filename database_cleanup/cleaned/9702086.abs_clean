We review an approach to the construction and classification of p-branesolitons in arbitrary dimensions, with an emphasis on those that arise intoroidally-compactified M-theory. Procedures for constructing the low-energysupergravity limits in arbitrary dimensions, and for studying the supersymmetryproperties of the solitons are presented. Wide classes of p-brane solutions areobtained, and their properties and classification in terms of bound states andintersections of M-branes are described.
