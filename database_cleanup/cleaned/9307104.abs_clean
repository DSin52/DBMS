Two types of semiclassical calculations have been used to study quantumeffects in black hole backgrounds, the WKB and the mean field approaches. Inthis work we systematically reconstruct the logical implications of bothmethods on quantum black hole physics and provide the link between these twoapproaches. Our conclusions completely support our previous findings basedexcitations and, consequently, no information loss paradox exists in thisproblem.
