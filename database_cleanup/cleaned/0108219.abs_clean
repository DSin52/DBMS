We investigate hetrotic string theory on special holonomy manifolds includingexceptional holonomy G_2 and Spin(7) manifolds. The gauge symmetry is F_4 in aG_2 manifold compactification, and so(9) in a Spin(7) manifold> G_2 > su(3) > su(2). The differences of adjoining groups are described byIsing, tricritical Ising, 3-state Potts and u(1) models. These theories areessential for spacetime supersymmetries and gauge group enhancements. Asconcrete examples, we construct modular invariant partition functions andanalyze their massless spectra for G_2 and Spin(7) orbifolds. We obtain therelation between topological numbers of the manifolds and multiplicities ofmatters in specific representations.
