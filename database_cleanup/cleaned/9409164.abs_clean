In two dimensional fluid, there are only two classes of swimming ways ofmicro-organisms, {\it i.e.}, ciliated and flagellated motions. Towardsunderstanding of this fact, we analyze the swimming problem by using$w_{1+\infty}$ and/or $W_{1+\infty}$ algebras. In the study of the relationshipbetween these two algebras, there appear the wave functions expressing theshape of micro-organisms. In order to construct the well-defined quantummechanics based on $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra and the wave functions, essentiallyonly two different kinds of the definitions are allowed on the hermitianconjugate and the inner products of the wave functions. These two definitionsare related with the shapes of ciliates and flagellates. The formulationproposed in this paper using $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra and the wave functions isthe quantum mechanics of the fluid dynamics where the stream function plays therole of the Hamiltonian. We also consider the area-preserving algebras whicharise in the swimming problem of micro-organisms in the two dimensional fluid.These algebras are larger than the usual $w_{1+\infty}$ and $W_{1+\infty}$algebras. We give a free field representation of this extended $W_{1+\infty}$algebra.
