The `classical' model for a massive spinning particle, which was recentlyproposed, is derived from the isotropic rotator model. Through this derivation,we note that the spin can be understood as the relativistic extension of theisotropic rotator. Furthermore, the variables $t_\m$ corresponding to the$\p^*$ of the `pseudo-classical' model, are necessary for the covariantformulation. The dynamical term for these extra variables is naturally obtainedand the meaning of the constraint term $p^\s\L_{\s\n}+mt_\n =0$, which wasrecently shown to give `quasi-supersymmetry', is clarified.
