We propose a stringy mechanism whereby a large hierarchy between symmetrybreaking scales is generated. This mechanism is based upon the existence of afifth dimension compactified on a segment. We focus on a simple supersymmetricmodel with one massless Higgs field in the 3 of SU(3) and another one in the$\bar 3$ on each four dimensional end-point of the fifth dimension. Alongsupersymmetric flat directions the gauge symmetry is broken down to SU(2) dueto the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs fields on one of the end points.The remaining massless mode on the other end point acquires a potential due toa massive five dimensional state propagating between the end points. Thispotential breaks the SU(2) symmetry at an exponentially suppressed scalecompared to the SU(3) breaking scale. The suppression factor dependsexponentially on the mass M of the massive state and the length $\pi R$ of thefifth dimension. For reasonably large values of the length scale R one canachieve a factor of order $M_{W}/M_GUT}$.
