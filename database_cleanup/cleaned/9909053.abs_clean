We obtain the general inflationary solutions for the slab of five-dimensionalAdS spacetime where the fifth dimension is an orbifold $S^1/Z_2$ and twothree-branes reside at its boundaries, of which the Randall-Sundrum modelcorresponds to the static limit. The investigation of the general solutions andtheir static limit reveals that the RS model recasts both the cosmologicalconstant problem and the gauge hierarchy problem into the balancing problem ofthe bulk and the brane cosmological constants.
