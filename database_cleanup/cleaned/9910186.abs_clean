We obtain a series expansion for the one loop fermion contribution to theeffective potential for constant A^a_\mu fields in SU(2) theory with a massivefermionic doublet. The series converges for bounded electric fields in terms ofthe magnetic fields and the gauge potentials. One finds that spontaneousfermion pair creation may be absent for arbitrary strong pure electric fields,with an appropriate choice of the classical currents.
