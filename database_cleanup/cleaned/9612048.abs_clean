Authors: Ahmad Shariati

Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX

Using a simple ansatz for the solutions of the three dimensionalgeneralization of the sine--Gordon and Toda model introduced by Konopelchenkoand Rogers, a class of solutions is found by elementary methods. It is alsoshown that these equations are not evolution equations in the sense thatsolution to the initial value problem is not unique.
