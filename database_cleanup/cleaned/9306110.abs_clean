addition the construction of the lattice string ansatz in D >2 dimensions.(Note that the title has been changed.)The U(N) gauge theory on a D-dimensional lattice is reformulated as a theoryof lattice strings (a statistical model of random surfaces). The Boltzmannweights of the surfaces can have both signs and are tuned so that thelongitudinal modes of the string are elliminated. The U(\infty) gauge theory isdescribed by noninteracting planar surfaces and the 1/N corrections areproduced by surfaces with higher topology as well as by contact interactionsdue to microscopic tubes, trousers, handles, etc. We pay special attention tothe case D=2 where the sum over surfaces can be performed explicitly, anddemonstrate that it reproduces the known exact results for the free energy andWilson loops in the continuum limit. In D=4 dimensions, our lattice stringmodel reproduces the strong coupling phase of the gauge theory. The weakcoupling phase is described by a more complicated string whose world surfacemay have windows. A possible integration measure in the space of continuoussurfaces is suggested.
