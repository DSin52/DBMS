We present the new explicit geometrical knowledge of the Landau-Ginzburgorbifolds, when a typical type of superpotential is considered. Relying ontoric geometry, we show the one-to-one correspondence between some of the$(a,c)$ states with $U(1)$ charges $(-1,1)$ and the $(1,1)$ forms coming fromblowing-up processes. Consequently, we find the monomial-divisor mirror map forLandau-Ginzburg orbifolds. The possibility of the application of the models ofother types is briefly discussed.
