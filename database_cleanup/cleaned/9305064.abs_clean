Non-perturbative effects of instanton-like solutions are studied within theframework of supergravity theories with field-dependent gauge functions.Fermionic zero modes are constructed and some typical correlation functions areevaluated. The effects of instantons are very similar to those in globally$U(1)$ symmetry. Non-perturbative amplitudes receive corrections which aresuppressed at large distances.
