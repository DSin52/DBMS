Title: Thirring sine-Gordon relationship by canonical methods

Authors: V. Juricic, B. Sazdovic

Comments: Latex, 17 pages

Using the canonical method developed for anomalous theories, we present theindependent rederivation of the quantum relationship between the massiveThirring and the sine-Gordon models. The same method offers the possibility toobtain the Mandelstam soliton operators as a solution of Poisson brackets"equation" for the fermionic fields. We checked the anticommutation and basicPoisson brackets relations for these composite operators. The transition fromthe Hamiltonian to the corresponding Lagrangian variables produces the knownMandelstam's result.
