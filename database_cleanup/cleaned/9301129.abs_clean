We consider the physical properties of four dimensional black hole solutionsto the effective action describing the low energy dynamics of the gravitationalsector of heterotic superstring theory. We compare the properties of theexternal field strengths in the perturbative solution to the full $O(\alpha')$string effective action equations, to those of exact solutions in a truncatedaction for charged black holes, and to the Kerr-Newman family of solutions ofEinstein-Maxwell theory. We contrast the numerical results obtained in theseapproaches, and discuss limitations of the analyses. Finally we discuss how thenew features of classical string gravity affect the standard tests of generalrelativity.
