Research E2-96-234, Dubna, 1996In the framework of the generalized Hamiltonian formalism by Dirac, the localsymmetries of dynamical systems with first- and second-class constraints areinvestigated. For theories with an algebra of constraints of special form (towhich a majority of the physically interesting theories belongs) the method ofconstructing the generator of local-symmetry transformations is obtained fromthe requirement of the quasi-invariance of an action. It is proved thatsecond-class constraints do not contribute to the transformation law of thelocal symmetry which entirely is stipulated by all the first-class constraints.It is thereby shown that degeneracy of special form theories with the first-and second-class constraints is due to their quasi-invariance underlocal-symmetry transformations.
