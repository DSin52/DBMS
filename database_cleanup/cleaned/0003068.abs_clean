Comments: 6 pages, Latex, contribution to the proceedings of the TMR network

conference in Paris 1999The Wilson loop in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory admits a dualdescription as a macroscopic string configuration in the adS/CFTcorrespondence. We discuss the correction to the quark anti-quark potentialarising from the fluctuations of the superstring.
