Recently \REF\dk{Simon Dalley and Igor Klebanov,'Light Cone Quantization ofthe $c=2$ Matrix Model', PUPT-1333, hepth@xxx/920705} \refend Dalley andKlebanov proposed a light-cone quantized study of the $c=2$ matrix model, butwhich ignores $k^{+}=0$ contributions. Since the non-critical string limit ofthe matrix model involves taking the parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of thematrix model to a critical point, zero modes of the field might be important inthis study. The constrained light-cone quantization (CLCQ) approach of Heinzl,Krusche and Werner is applied . It is found that there is coupling between thezero mode sector and the rest of the theory, hence CLCQ should be implemented.
