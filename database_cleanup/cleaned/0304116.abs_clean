The quantum statistical mechanics of generally covariant systems --particles,strings and membranes-- on noncommutative field spaces is studied. We discusshow to introduce non-local communication among different systems vianoncommutativity. This idea is applied to cosmology where we argue that due tothe breaking of relativistic invariance one can consider a privileged referencesystem where many universes interact as a quantum gas in a reservoir. Ifroughly speaking, we approximate the universes as tensionless membranes, then,the interaction among universes provided by noncommutativity is harmonic. Theoscillation frequency for each universe is proportional to $B/M$, where $B$ isthe noncommutativity parameter --that we identify as the primordial magneticfield, {\it i.e.} $\sim 10^{-16} {GeV}^2$- and $M$ is the mass of the universe($\sim 10^{77} {GeV}$) and, therefore each universe have the pulsationfrequency $\omega \sim 10^{-68} s^{-1}$.
