We present the static, spherically symmetric solutions of the low energy $d =4$ string. They form a simple generalisation of the Schwarzschild solution anddescribe the gravitational field of a spherical star in perturbative stringtheory. If the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ is different from one, thesesolutions describe singular objects with naked singularities at their horizons,and whose Hawking temperature is infinite. These objects might represent``massive remnants'', the end states of black holes. Our analysis also impliesthat Brans-Dicke theory has a naked singularity. Invoking cosmic censorshipconjecture will rule out Brans-Dicke theory.
