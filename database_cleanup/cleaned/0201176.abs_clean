Title: Absorption cross section in de Sitter space

Comments: 13 pages, version to appear in MPLA

We study the wave equation for a minimally coupled massive scalar inthree-dimensional de Sitter space. We compute the absorption cross section toinvestigate its cosmological horizon in the southern diamond. Although theabsorption cross section is not defined exactly, we can be determined it fromthe fact that the low-energy $s(j=0)$-wave absorption cross section for amassless scalar is given by the area of the cosmological horizon. On the otherhand, the low-temperature limit of $j\not=0$-mode absorption cross section isuseful for extracting information surrounding the cosmological horizon. Finallywe mention a computation of the absorption cross section on the CFT-side usingthe dS/CFT correspondence.
