We study dynamical aspects of holographic correspondence between d=5 anti-deSitter supergravity and $d=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. We probe causality andlocality of ambient spacetime from super Yang-Mills theory by studyingtransmission of low-energy brane waves via an open string stretched between twoD3-branes in Coulomb branch. By analyzing two relevant physical thresholdscales, we find that causality and locality is encoded in the super Yang-Millstheory provided infinite tower of long supermultiplet operators are added.Massive W-boson and dual magnetic monopole behave more properly as extended,bilocal objects. We also study causal time-delay of low-energy excitation onheavy quark or meson and find an excellent agreement between anti-de Sittersupergravity and super Yang-Mills theory descriptions. We observe that strong`t Hooft coupling dynamics and holographic scale-size relation thereof play acrucial role to the agreement of dynamical processes.
