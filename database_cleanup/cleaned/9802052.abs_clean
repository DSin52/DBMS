Title: Comments on Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory on a Noncommutative Torus

Comments: 11 pages, two attached figures, harvmac

D0-brane theory on a torus with a nonvanishing B field is embedded into astring theory in the weak coupling limit. It is shown that the usualsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a noncommutative torus can not be the wholestory. The Born-Infeld action survives the noncommutative torus limit.
