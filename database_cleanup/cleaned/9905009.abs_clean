The Atiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin matrix corresponding to a tetrahedrallysymmetric 3-instanton is calculated. Some small variations of the matrixcorrespond to vibrations of the instanton-generated 3-Skyrmion. Thesevibrations are decomposed under tetrahedral symmetry and this decomposition iscompared to previous knowledge of the 3-Skyrmion vibration spectrum.
