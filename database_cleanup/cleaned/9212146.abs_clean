We investigate the qualitative new features of charged dilatonic black holeswhich emerge when both the Yang-Mills and Gauss-Bonnet curvature correctionsare included in the effective action. We consider perturbative effects by anexpansion up to second order in the inverse string tension on the fourdimensional Schwarzschild background and determine the backreaction. Wecalculate the thermodynamical functions and show that for magnetic charge abovea critical value, the temperature of the black hole has a maximum and goes tozero for a finite value of the mass. This indicates that the conventionalHawking evaporation law is modified by string theory at a classical level.
