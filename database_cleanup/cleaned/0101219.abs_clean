We investigate the deformation of D-brane world-volumes in curvedbackgrounds. We calculate the leading corrections to the boundary conformalfield theory involving the background fields, and in particular we study thecorrelation functions of the resulting system. This allows us to obtain theworld-volume deformation, identifying the open string metric and thenoncommutative deformation parameter. The picture that unfolds is theobtains the standard Moyal deformation of the brane world-volume. Similarly,when d\omega = 0 one obtains the noncommutative Kontsevich deformation,physically corresponding to a curved brane in a flat background. When thebackground is curved, H = d\omega \not= 0, we find that the relevant algebraicstructure is still based on the Kontsevich expansion, which now defines anonassociative star product with an A_\infty homotopy associative algebraicstructure. We then recover, within this formalism, some known results of Matrixtheory in curved backgrounds. In particular, we show how the effective actionobtained in this framework describes, as expected, the dielectric effect ofD-branes. The polarized branes are interpreted as a soliton, associated to thecondensation of the brane gauge field.
