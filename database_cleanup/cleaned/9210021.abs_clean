In string theory it is known that abelian isometries in the sigma model leadto target space duality. We generalize this duality to backgrounds withnon--abelian isometries. The procedure we follow consists of gauging theisometries of the original action and constraining the field strength $F$ tovanish. This new action generates dual theories by integrating over either theLagrange multipliers that set F=0 or the gauge fields. We find that this newduality transformation maps spaces with non--abelian isometries to spaces thatmay have no isometries at all. This suggests that duality symmetries in stringtheories need to be understood in a more general context without regard to theexistence of continuous isometries on the target space (this is also indicatedby the existence of duality in string compactifications on Calabi--Yaumanifolds which have no continuous isometries). Physically interesting examplesto which our formalism apply are the Schwarzschild metric and the 4D chargeddilatonic black hole. For these spherically symmetric black holes in fourdimensions, the dual backgrounds are presented and explicitly shown to be newsolutions of the leading order string equations. Some of these new backgroundsare found to have no continuous isometries (except for time translations) andalso have naked singularities.
