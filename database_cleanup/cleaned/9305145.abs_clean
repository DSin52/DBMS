As is known, tetrahedron equations lead to the commuting family oftransfer-matrices and provide the integrability of correspondingthree-dimensional lattice models. We present the modified version of theseequations which give the commuting family of more complicated two-layertransfer-matrices. In the static limit we have succeeded in constructing thesolution of these equations in terms of elliptic functions.
