We investigate non-local dualities between suitably compactifiedhigher-dimensional Einstein gravity and supergravities which can be revealed ifone reinterprets the dualised Kaluza-Klein two-forms in $D>4$ as antisymmetricforms belonging to supergravities. We find several examples of such acorrespondence including one between the six-dimensional Einstein gravity andthe four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion theory (truncated N=4supergravity), and others between the compactified eleven and ten-dimensionalsupergravities and the eight or ten-dimensional pure gravity. The Killingspinor equation of the D=11 supergravity is shown to be equivalent to thegeometric Killing spinor equation in the dual gravity. We give several examplesof using new dualities for solution generation and demonstrate how $p$-branescan be interpreted as non-local duals of pure gravity solutions. Newsupersymmetric solutions are presented including $M2\subset 5$-brane with tworotation parameters.
