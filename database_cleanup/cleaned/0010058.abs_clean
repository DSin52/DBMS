The solution representing a brane-anti-brane system in matrix models breaksthe usual matrix spacetime symmetry. We show that the spacetime symmetry on thebranes is not breaking, rather appears as a combination of the matrix spacetimetransformation and a gauge transformation. As a result, the tachyon field,itself an off-diagonal entry in longitudinal matrices, transforms nontriviallyunder rotations, decomposing into tensors of different ranks. We also show thatthe tachyon field can never be gauged away, and conjecture that this field isrelated to the usual complex scalar tachyon by a field redefinition. We alsobriefly discuss tachyon condensation.
