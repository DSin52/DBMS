Large $N$ two-dimensional QCD on a cylinder and on a vertex manifold (asphere with three holes) is investigated. The relation between the saddle-pointdescription and the collective field theory of QCD$_2$ is established. Usingthis relation, it is shown that the Douglas--Kazakov phase transition on acylinder is associated with the presence of a gap in the eigenvaluedistributions for Wilson loops. An exact formula for the phase transition ondisc with an arbitrary boundary holonomy is found. The role of instantons ininducing such transitions is discussed. The zero-area limit of the partitionfunction on a vertex manifold is studied. It is found that this partitionfunction vanishes unless the boundary conditions satisfy a certain selectionrule which is an analogue of momentum conservation in field theory.
