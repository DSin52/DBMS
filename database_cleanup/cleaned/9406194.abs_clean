Title: Yangian Double and Rational R-matrix

University)Comments: 25 pages

Studying the algebraic structure of the double ${\cal D}Y(g)$ of the yangian$Y(g)$ we present the triangular decomposition of ${\cal D}Y(g)$ and afactorization for the canonical pairing of the yangian with its dual inside${\cal D}Y(g)$. As a consequence we obtain an explicit formula for theuniversal R-matrix $R$ of ${\cal D}Y(g)$ and demonstrate how it works inevaluation representations of $Y(sl_2)$. We interprete one-dimensional factorarising in concrete representations of $R$ as bilinear form on highest weightpolynomials of irreducible representations of $Y(g)$ and express this form interms of {\it gamma-functions}.
