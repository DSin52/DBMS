We discuss theories with 16 and 8 supercharges in 6 and 7 dimensions. Thesetheories are defined as world-volume theories of 5- and 6-branes of type II andM theories, in the limit in which bulk modes decouple. We analyze in detail thespectrum of BPS extended objects of these theories, and show that the 6dimensional ones can be interpreted as little (non-critical) string theories.The little 5-branes of the 6 dimensional theories with 16 supercharges are usedto find new string theories with 8 supercharges, which have additional groupstructure. We describe the web of dualities relating all these theories. Weshow that the theories with 16 supercharges can be used for a Matrixdescription of M-theory on T^6 in the general case, and that they alsoreproduce Matrix theory on T^5 and T^4 in some particular limit.
