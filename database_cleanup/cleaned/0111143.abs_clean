We discuss the Schrodinger equation in presence of quaternionic potentials.The study is performed analytically as long as it proves possible, when not, weresort to numerical calculations. The results obtained could be useful toinvestigate an underlying quaternionic quantum dynamics in particle physics.Experimental tests and proposals to observe quaternionic quantum effects byneutron interferometry are briefly reviewed.
