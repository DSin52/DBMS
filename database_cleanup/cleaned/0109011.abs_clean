We use the generalised rational map ansatz introduced by Ioannidou et al. toconstruct analytically some topologically non-trivial solutions of thegeneralised SU(3) Skyrme model defined by adding a sixth order term to theusual Lagrangian. These solutions are radially symmetric and some of them canbe interpreted as bound states of Skyrmions. The same ansatz is used toconstruct low-energy configuration of the SU(N) Skyrme model.
