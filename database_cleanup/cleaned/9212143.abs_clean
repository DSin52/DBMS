Title: Hidden geometrical structures in integrable models

Authors: Patrick Dorey

Comments: 15 pages, preprint NI92018. (one minor elucidation in the last

section)The bootstrap equations for the ADE series of purely elastic scatteringtheories have turned out to be intimately connected with the geometry of rootsystems and the Coxeter element. An informal review of some of this material isgiven, mentioning also a couple of other contexts -- the Pasquier models, andthe simply-laced affine Toda field theories -- where similar structures areencountered. The relevance of twisted Coxeter elements is indicated, and aconstruction of these elements inspired by the twisted foldings of the affineToda models is described.
