We use Ward identities derived from the generalized Konishi anomaly in orderto compute effective superpotentials for SU(N), SO(N) and $Sp(N)$supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to matter in various representations. Inparticular we focus on cubic and quartic tree level superpotentials. With thistechnique higher order corrections to the perturbative part of the effectivesuperpotential can be easily evaluated.
