We make use of product integrals to provide an unambiguous mathematicalrepresentation of Wilson line and Wilson loop operators. Then, drawing uponvarious properties of product integrals, we discuss such properties of theseoperators as approximating them with partial sums, their convergence, and theirbehavior under gauge transformations. We also obtain a surface product integralrepresentation for the Wilson loop operator. The result can be interpreted asthe non-abelian version of Stokes theorem.
