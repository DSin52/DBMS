Authors: H. Aratyn and J. van de Leur

Comments: 28 pages, LaTeX

Geometry; Exactly Solvable and Integrable SystemsWe show that reductions of KP hierarchies related to the loop algebra of$SL_n$ with homogeneous gradation give solutions of the Darboux-Egoroff systemof PDE's. Using explicit dressing matrices of the Riemann-Hilbert problemgeneralized to include a set of commuting additional symmetries, we constructsolutions of the Witten--Dijkgraaf--E. Verlinde--H. Verlinde equations.
