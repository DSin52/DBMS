It is shown that the recently proposed target space duality for (0,2) modelsis not limited to models admitting a Landau-Ginzburg description. By studyingsome generic examples it is established for the broader class of vector bundlesover complete intersections in toric varieties. Instead of sharing a commonLandau-Ginzburg locus, a pair of dual models agrees in more generalnon-geometric phases. The mathematical tools for treating reflexive sheaves areprovided, as well.
