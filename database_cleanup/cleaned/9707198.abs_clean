The moduli spaces of two (0,2) compactifications of the heterotic string canshare the same Landau-Ginzburg model even though at large radius they lookcompletely different. It was argued that such a pair of (0,2) models might beconnected via a perturbative transition at the Landau-Ginzburg point.Situations of this kind are studied for some explicit models. By calculatingthe exact dimensions of the generic moduli spaces at large radius, strongindications are found in favor of a different scenario. The two moduli spacesare isomorphic and complex, K\"ahler and bundle moduli get exchanged.
