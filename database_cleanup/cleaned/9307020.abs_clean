SystemsThe string equation appearing in the double scaling limit of the Hermitianone--matrix model, which corresponds to a Galilean self--similar condition forthe KdV hierarchy, is reformulated as a scaling self--similar condition for theUr--KdV hierarchy. A non--scaling limit analysis of the one--matrix model hasled to the complexified NLS hierarchy and a string equation. We show that thiscorresponds to the Galilean self--similarity condition for the AKNS hierarchyand also its equivalence to a scaling self--similar condition for theHeisenberg ferromagnet hierarchy.
