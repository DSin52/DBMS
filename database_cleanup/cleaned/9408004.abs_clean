We consider the sine-Gordon model on a half-line, with an additionalpotential term of the form $-M\cos{\beta\over 2}(\varphi-\varphi_0)$ at theboundary. We compute the classical time delay for general values of $M$,$\beta$ and $\varphi_0$ using $\tau$-function methods and show that in theclassical limit, the method of images still works, despite the non-linearity ofthe problem. We also perform a semi-classical analysis, and find agreement withthe exact quantum S-matrix conjectured by Ghoshal and Zamolodchikov.
