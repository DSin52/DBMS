Authors: George Siopsis

Comments: 10 pages, sprocl, presented at the Arnowitt Fest, Texas A&M

University, April 1998. To appear in the Festschrift Volume "Relativity,Particle Physics, and Cosmology," published by World ScientificWe discuss non-relativistic scattering by a Newtonian potential. We show thatthe gray-body factors associated with scattering by a black hole exhibit thesame functional dependence as scattering amplitudes in the Newtonian limit,which should be the weak-field limit of any quantum theory of gravity. Thisbehavior arises independently of the presence of supersymmetry. The connectionto two-dimensional conformal field theory is also discussed.
