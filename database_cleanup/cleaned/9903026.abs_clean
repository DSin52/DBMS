We discuss a solution of the equations of motion of five-dimensional gaugedtype IIB supergravity that describes confining SU(N) gauge theories at large Nand large 't Hooft parameter. We prove confinement by computing the Wilsonloop, and we show that our solution is generic, independent of most of thedetails of the theory. In particular, the Einstein-frame metric near itssingularity, and the condensates of scalar, composite operators are universal.Also universal is the discreteness of the glueball mass spectrum and theexistence of a mass gap. The metric is also identical to a genericallyconfining solution recently found in type 0B theory.
