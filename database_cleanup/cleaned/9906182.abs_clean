Following a recent suggestion by Randall and Sundrum, we consider stringcompactification scenarios in which a compact slice of AdS-space arises as asubspace of the compactification manifold. A specific example is provided bythe type II orientifold equivalent to type I theory on (orbifolds of) $T^6$,upon taking into account the gravitational backreaction of the D3-braneslocalized inside the $T^6$. The conformal factor of the four-dimensional metricdepends exponentially on one of the compact directions, which, via theholographic correspondence, becomes identified with the renormalization groupscale in the uncompactified world. This set-up can be viewed as ageneralization of the AdS/CFT correspondence to boundary theories that includegravitational dynamics. A striking consequence is that, in this scenario, thefundamental Planck size string and the large N QCD string appear as (twodifferent wavefunctions of) one and the same object.
