We discuss the covariant formulation of local field theories described by theCompanion Lagrangian associated with p-branes. The covariantisation is shown tobe useful for clarifying the geometrical meaning of the field equations andalso their relation to the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of the standardDirac-Born-Infeld theory.
