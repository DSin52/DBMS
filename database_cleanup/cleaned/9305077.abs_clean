Certain phase space path integrals can be evaluated exactly using equivariantcohomology and localization in the canonical loop space. Here we extend this toa general class of models. We consider hamiltonians which are {\it a priori}arbitrary functions of the Cartan subalgebra generators of a Lie group which isdefined on the phase space. We evaluate the corresponding path integral andfind that it is closely related to the infinitesimal Lefschetz number of aDirac operator on the phase space. Our results indicate that equivariantcharacteristic classes could provide a natural geometric framework forunderstanding quantum integrability.
