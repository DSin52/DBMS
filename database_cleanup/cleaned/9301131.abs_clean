We display a new integrable perturbation for both N=1 and N=2 superconformalminimal models. These perturbations break supersymmetry explicitly. Theirexistence was expected on the basis of the classification of integrableperturbations of conformal field theories in terms of distinct classical KdVtype hierarchies sharing a common second Hamiltonian structure.
