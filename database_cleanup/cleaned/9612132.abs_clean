Title: The Field Theory of Generalized Ferromagnet on the Hermitian Symmetric

SpacesAuthors: Phillial Oh

Comments: 9 pages, Talk given at 15th Symposium on Theoretical Physics

Theoretical Methods in Fundamental Physics", Seoul, Korea, August 1996We discuss the recent developments in the generalized continuous Heisenbergferromagnet model formulated as a nonrelativistic field theory defined on thetarget space of the coadjoint orbits. Hermitian symmetric spaces are specialbecause they provide completely integrable field theories in 1+1 dimension andself-dual Chern-Simons solitons and vortices in 2+1 dimension.
