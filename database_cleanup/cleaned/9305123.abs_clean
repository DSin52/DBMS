One of the paradoxes associated with the theory of the formation andsubsequent Hawking evaporation of a black hole is the disappearance ofconserved global charges. It has long been known that metric fluctuations atshort distances (wormholes) violate global-charge conservation; if globalcharges are apparently conserved at ordinary energies, it is only becausewormhole-induced global-charge-violating terms in the low-energy effectiveLagrangian are suppressed by large mass denominators. However, such suppressedinteractions can become important at the high energy densities inside acollapsing star. We analyze this effect for a simple model of the black-holesingularity. (Our analysis is totally independent of any detailed theory ofwormhole dynamics; in particular it does not depend on the wormhole theory ofthe vanishing of the cosmological constant.) We find that in general all chargeis extinguished before the infalling matter crosses the singularity. No globalcharge appears in the outgoing Hawking radiation because it has all gone downthe wormholes.
