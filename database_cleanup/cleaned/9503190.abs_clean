We investigate the integrability of the Schwinger-Dyson equations in $c = 1 -\frac{6}{m(m+1)}$ string field theory which were proposed by Ikehara et al asthe continuum limit of the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the matrix chain model.We show the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations generate a closed algebra. Thisalgebra contains Virasoro algebra but does not coincide with $W_{\infty}$algebra. We include in the Schwinger-Dyson equations a new process of removingfrom the loop boundaries the operator ${\cal H}(\sigma)$ which locally changesthe spin configuration. We also derive the string field Hamiltonian from thecontinuum Schwinger-Dyson equations. Its form is universal for all $c = 1 -\frac{6}{m(m+1)}$ string theories.
