Continuing the investigation of CNM (chiral-nonminimal) hypermultipletnonlinear sigma-models, we propose extensions of the concept of the c-map whichrelate holomorphic functions to hyper-Kahler geometries. In particular, we showthat a whole series of hyper-Kahler potentials can be derived by replacing therole of the 4D, N = 1 tensor multiplet in the original c-map by 4D, N = 1non-minimal multiplets and auxiliary superfields. The resulting N = 2 modelsappear to have interesting connections to Calabi-Yau manifolds and algebraicvarieties. These models also emphasize the fact that special hyper-Kahlermanifolds (the analogs of special Kahler manifolds) without isometries exist.
