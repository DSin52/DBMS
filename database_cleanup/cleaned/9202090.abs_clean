The recent interest in ``time machines'' has been largely fueled by theapparent ease with which such systems may be formed in general relativity,given relatively benign initial conditions such as the existence of traversablewormholes or of infinite cosmic strings. This rather disturbing state ofaffairs has led Hawking to formulate his Chronology Protection Conjecture,whereby the formation of ``time machines'' is forbidden. This paper will useseveral simple examples to argue that the universe appears to exhibit a``defense in depth'' strategy in this regard. For appropriate parameter regimesCasimir effects, wormhole disruption effects, and gravitational back reactioneffects all contribute to the fight against time travel. Particular attentionis paid to the role of the quantum gravity cutoff. For the class of modelproblems considered it is shown that the gravitational back reaction becomeslarge before the Planck scale quantum gravity cutoff is reached, thussupporting Hawking's conjecture.
