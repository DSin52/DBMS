Title: Modifications of the area law and N=2 supersymmetric black holes

Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX; contribution to the Brussels conference in honour of

Francois Englert, March 1999, to be published in the proceedingsModifications of the area law are crucial in order to find agreement withmicroscopic entropy calculations based on string theory, when includingcontributions that are subleading for large charges. The deviations of the arealaw are in accord with Wald's proposal for the entropy based on a Noethercharge. We discuss this for the case of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetricblack holes.
