We present a simple algorithm to obtain solutions that generalize theIsrael--Wilson--Perj\'es class for the low-energy limit of heterotic stringtheory toroidally compactified from D=d+3 to three dimensions. A remarkable mapexisting between the Einstein--Maxwell (EM) theory and the theory underconsideration allows us to solve directly the equations of motion making use ofthe matrix Ernst potentials connected with the coset matrix of heterotic stringtheory. For the particular case d=1 (if we put n=6, the resulting theory can beconsidered as the bosonic part of the action of D=4, N=4 supergravity) weobtain explicitly a dyonic solution in terms of one real 2\times 2--matrixharmonic function and 2n real constants (n being the number of Abelian vectorfields). By studying the asymptotic behaviour of the field configurations wedefine the charges of the system. They satisfy theBogomol'nyi--Prasad--Sommmerfeld (BPS) bound.
