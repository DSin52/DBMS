Proceedings of XXXVII Karpacz Winter School edited in the Proceedings Seriesof American Mathematical Society, editors J. Lukierski and J. RembielinskiClassical version of Born-Infeld electrodynamics is recalled and its mostimportant properties discussed. Then we analyze possible abelian andnon-abelian generalizations of this theory, and show how certain soliton-likeconfigurations can be obtained. The relationship with the Standard Model ofelectroweak interactions is also mentioned.
