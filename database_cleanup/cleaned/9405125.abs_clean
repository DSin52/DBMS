The properties of the three-dimensional noncanonical osp(3/2) oscillators,The angular momentum M of the oscillators can take at most three valuesM=p-1,p,p+1, which are either all integers or all half-integers. Thecoordinates anticommute with each other. Depending on the state space theenergy spectrum can coincide or can be essentially different from those of thecanonical oscillator. The ground state is in general degenerated.
