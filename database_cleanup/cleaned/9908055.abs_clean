Within the framework of the Gaussian wave-functional approach, we investigatethe influences of quantum and finite-temperature effects on theZ_2-symmetry(\phi \to -\phi) of the (1+1)-dimensional massive sine-Gordon fieldtheory. It is explicitly demonstrated that by quantum effects the Z_2-symmetrycan be restored in one region of the parameter space and dynamicallyspontaneously broken in another region. Moreover, a finite-temperature effectcan further restore the Z_2-symmetry only.
