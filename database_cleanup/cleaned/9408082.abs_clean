We explicitly construct the extension of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra bytwo super primary fields of dimension two and three with vanishing u(1)-charge.Using a super covariant formalism we obtain two different solutions bothconsistent for generic values of the central charge c. The first one can beidentified with the super W_4-algebra - the symmetry algebra of the CP(3)Kazama-Suzuki model. With the help of unitarity arguments we predict theself-coupling constant of the field of dimension two for all superW_n-algebras. The second solution is special in the sense that it does not havea finite classical limit c->infinity and generic null fields appear. In thespirit of recent results in the N=0 case it can be understood as a unifying N=2super W-algebra for all CP(n) coset models. It does not admit any unitaryrepresentation.
