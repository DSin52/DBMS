By using the field-antifield formalism, we show that the method of Batalin,Fradkin, Fradkina and Tyutin to convert Hamiltonian systems submitted to secondclass constraints introduces compensating fields which do not belong to theBRST cohomology at ghost number one. This assures that the gauge symmetrieswhich arise from the BFFT procedure are not obstructed at quantum level. Anexample where massive electrodynamics is coupled to chiral fermions isconsidered. We solve the quantum master equation for the model and show thatthe respective counterterm has a decisive role in extracting anomalousexpectation values associated with the divergence of the Noether chiralcurrent.
