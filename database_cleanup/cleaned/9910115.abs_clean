We discuss the relevance of Eisenstein series for representing certainG(Z)-invariant string theory amplitudes which receive corrections from BPSstates only. The Eisenstein series are constructed using G(Z)-invariant massformulae and are manifestly invariant modular functions on the symmetric spaceK\G(R) of non-compact type, with K the maximal compact subgroup of G(R). Inparticular, we show how Eisenstein series of the T-duality group SO(d,d,Z) canbe used to represent one- and g-loop amplitudes in compactified string theory.We also obtain their non-perturbative extensions in terms of the Eisensteinseries of the U-duality group E_{d+1(d+1)}(Z).
