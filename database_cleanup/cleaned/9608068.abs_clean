We develop systematic geometric methods for studying thesemi-classical properties of phase space path integrals for dynamical systems,emphasizing the relations with integrable and topological quantum fieldtheories. Beginning with a detailed review of the relevant mathematicalbackground -- equivariant cohomology and the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem, wedemonstrate how the localization ideas are related to classical integrabilityand how they can be formally extended to derive explicit localization formulasfor path integrals in special instances using BRST quantization techniques.Various loop space localizations are presented and related to notions inquantum integrability and topological field theory. We emphasize the commonsymmetries that such localizable models always possess and use these symmetriesto discuss the range of applicability of the localization formulas. A number ofphysical and mathematical applications are presented in connection withelementary quantum mechanics, Morse theory, index theorems, character formulasfor semi-simple Lie groups, quantization of spin systems, unitary integrationsin matrix models, modular invariants of Riemann surfaces, supersymmetricquantum field theories, two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, conformal fieldtheory, cohomological field theories and the loop expansion in quantum fieldtheory. Some modern techniques of path integral quantization, such as coherentstate methods, are also discussed. The relations between equivariantlocalization and other ideas in topological field theory, such as theBatalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky and Mathai-Quillen formalisms, are presented.
