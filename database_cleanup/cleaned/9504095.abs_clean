Title: String-Membrane Duality in Seven Dimensions

Comments: The original version of this paper dealt mostly with one side of

as a $K_3$ compactified D=11 superfivebrane. The revised version includes ainterpretation as a $T^3$ compactified heterotic fivebrane. It also includesa discussion of D=8 membrane-membrane duality, and various changes to thereferencesJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B354 (1995) 247-255

The conjectured equivalence of the heterotic string to a $K_3$ compactifiedtype IIA superstring is combined with the conjectured equivalence of the latterto a compactified 11-dimensional supermembrane to derive a string membraneduality in seven dimensions; the membrane is a soliton of the string theory andvice versa. A prediction of this duality is that the heterotic string is a$K_3$ compactification of the solitonic 11-dimensional fivebrane. It isverified that the worldsheet action of the D=10 heterotic string is indeedobtainable by $K_3$ compactification of the worldvolume action of the11-dimensional fivebrane, and it is suggested how the worldvolume action of theD=11 supermebrane may be similarly obtained by $T^3$ compactification of theworldvolume action of a D=10 heterotic fivebrane. Generalizations to $D=8$string-threebrane and membrane-membrane duality are also discussed.
