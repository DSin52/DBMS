We propose a mechanism to trap massive vector fields as a photon on theRandall-Sundrum brane embedded in the five dimensional AdS space. Thislocalization-mechanism of the photon is realized by considering a brane action,to which a quadratic potential of the bulk-vector fields is added. We alsopoint out that this potential gives several constraints on the fluctuations ofthe vector fields in the bulk space.
