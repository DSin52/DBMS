A special Bianchi I universe is constructed in $~4D~$ string theory.Geometrically it represents a $~3D~$ anti-de-Sitter space crossed with a flatdirection whereas in terms of an associated conformal field theory it is anextremal case of a gauged WZWN theory with target the coset $~SU(1,1) \timesR^2 / R~$. Some of its properties are discussed.
