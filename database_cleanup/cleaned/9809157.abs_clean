A fermionic analogue of the Hodge star operation is shown to have an explicitoperator representation in models with fermions, in spacetimes of anydimension. This operator realizes a conjugation (pairing) not used explicitlyin field-theory, and induces a metric in the space of wave-function(al)s justas in exterior calculus. If made real (Hermitian), this induced metric turnsout to be identical to the standard one constructed using Hermitianconjugation; the utility of the induced complex bilinear form remains unclear.
