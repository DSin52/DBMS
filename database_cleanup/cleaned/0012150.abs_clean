We put forward an idea that the boundary entropy associated with integrablemassless flow of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) is identified with tachyonaction of boundary string field theory. We show that the temperatureparameterizing a massless flow in the TBA formalism can be identified withtachyon energy for the classical action at least near the ultraviolet fixedpoint, i.e. the open string vacuum.
