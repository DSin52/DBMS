Authors: Michael Teper (Oxford)

Comments: LaTeX, 28 pages, not submitted for publication

We summarise what lattice simulations have to say about the physicalproperties of continuum SU(N) gauge theories in 3+1 dimensions. The quantitiestemperature at which the theory becomes deconfined, the topologicalsusceptibility, the value of the scale Lambda{MS-bar} that governs the rate atwhich the coupling runs and the r0 parameter that characterises the staticquark potential at intermediate distances.
