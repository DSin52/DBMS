Focusing on gauge degrees of freedom specified by a 1+3 dimensions modelhosting a Maxwell term plus a Lorentz and CPT non-invariant Chern-Simons-likecontribution, we obtain a minimal extension of such a system to asupersymmetric environment. We comment on resulting peculiar self-couplings forthe gauge sector, as well as on background contribution for gaugino masses.Furthermore, a non-polynomial generalization is presented.
