We investigate the nature of the ground ring of c=1 string theory at thespecial A-D-E points in the c=1 moduli space associated to discrete subgroupsof SU(2). The chiral ground rings at these points are shown to define the A-D-Eseries of singular varieties introduced by Klein. The non-chiral ground ringsrelevant to closed-string theory are 3 real dimensional singular varietiesobtained as U(1) quotients of the Kleinian varieties. The unbroken symmetriesof the theory at these points are the volume-preserving diffeomorphisms ofthese varieties. The theory of Kleinian singularities has a close relation tothat of complex hyperKahler surfaces, or gravitational instantons. We speculateon the relevance of these instantons and of self-dual gravity in c=1 stringtheory.
