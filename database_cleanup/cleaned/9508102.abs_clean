We study the behavior of two diferent models at finite temperature in a$D$-dimensional spacetime. The first one is the $\lambda\varphi^{4}$ model andthe second one is the Gross-Neveu model. Using the one-loop approximation weshow that in the $\lambda\varphi^{4}$ model the thermal mass increase with thetemperature while the thermal coupling constant decrese with the temperature.Using this facts we establish that in the $(\lambda\varphi^{4})_{D=3}$ modelthere is a temperature $\beta^{-1}_{\star}$ above which the system can developa first order phase transition, where the origin corresponds to a metastablevacuum. In the massless Gross-Neveu model, we demonstrate that for $D=3$ thethermal correction to the coupling constant is zero. For $D\neq 3$ our resultsare inconclusive.
