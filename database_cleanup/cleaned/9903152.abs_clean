All Bianchi bialgebras have been obtained. By introducing a non-degenerateadjoint invariant inner product over these bialgebras the associated Drinfelddoubles have been constructed, then by calculating the coupling matrices forthese bialgebras several sigma-models with Poisson-Lie symmetry have beenobtained. Two simple examples as prototypes of Poisson-Lie dual models havebeen given.
