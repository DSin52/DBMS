We present evidence that the CHL string in eight dimensions is dual toF-theory compactified on an elliptic K3 with a $\Gamma_{0}(2)$ monodromy group.The monodromy group $\Gamma_{0}(2)$ allows one to turn on the flux of anantisymmetric two form along the base. The $B_{\mu \nu}$ flux is quantized andtherefore the moduli space of the CHL string is disconnected from the modulispace of F-theory/Heterotic strings (as expected). The non-zero $B_{\mu \nu}$flux obstructs certain deformations restricting the moduli of elliptic K3 to a10 dimensional moduli space. We also discuss how one can reconstruct the gaugegroups from the elliptic fibration structure.
