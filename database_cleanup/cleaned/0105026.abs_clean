in "Membranes 2000," Proceedings of the Fourth Mexican School on Gravitationand Mathematical Physics, Huatulco, 2000The Hamiltonian analysis of Polyakov action is reviewed putting emphasis instring it is computed the change of its action induced by the gaugetransformation coming from the first class constraints. As expected, theHamiltonian action is not gauge invariant due to the Hamiltonian constraintquadratic in the momenta. However, it is possible to add a boundary term to theoriginal action to build a fully gauge-invariant action at first order. Inaddition, two relatives of string theory whose actions are fullygauge-invariant under the gauge symmetry involved when the spatial slice isclosed are built. The first one is pure diffeomorphism in the sense it has noHamiltonian constraint and thus bosonic string theory becomes a sub-sector ofits space of solutions. The second one is associated with the tensionlessbosonic string, its boundary term induces a canonical transformation and thefully gauge-invariant action written in terms of the new canonical variablesbecomes linear in the momenta.
