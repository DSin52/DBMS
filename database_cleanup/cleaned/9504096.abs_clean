We investigate the question of how the knowledge of sufficiently many localconservation laws for a model can be utilized to solve the model. We show thatfor models where the conservation laws can be written in one-sided forms, like$\barpartial Q_s = 0$, the problem can always be reduced to solving a closedsystem of ordinary differential equations. We investigate the $A_1$, $A_2$, and$B_2$ Toda field theories in considerable detail from this viewpoint. One ofour findings is that there is in each case a transformation group intrinsic tothe model. This group is built on a specific real form of the Lie algebra usedto label the Toda field theory. It is the group of field transformations whichleaves the conserved densities invariant.
