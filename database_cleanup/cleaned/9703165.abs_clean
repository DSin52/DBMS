We extend to a general class of covariant gauges an approach which relatesthe thermal Green functions to forward scattering amplitudes of thermalparticles. A brief discussion of the non-transversality of the thermal gluonpolarization tensor is given in this context. This method is then applied tothe calculation of the ln(T) contributions associated with generalconfigurations of 2 and 3-point gluon functions. The results are Lorentzcovariant and have the same structure as the ultraviolet divergentcontributions which occur at zero temperature.
