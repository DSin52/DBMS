We prove that a class of one-loop partition functions found by Dienes, givingrise to a vanishing cosmological constant to one-loop, cannot be realized by aconsistent lattice string. The construction of non-supersymmetric string with avanishing cosmological constant therefore remains as elusive as ever. We alsodiscuss a new test that any one-loop partition function for a lattice stringmust satisfy.
