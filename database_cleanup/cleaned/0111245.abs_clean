We compute RR charges of D2-branes on a background with H-field which belongsto a nontrivial cohomology class. We discover that the RR charge depends on theconfiguration of the background `electric' RR field. This result explains theambiguity in the definition of the RR charge previously observed in the SU(2)WZW model.
