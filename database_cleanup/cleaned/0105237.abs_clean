We investigate conformal mechanics associated with the rotatingBertotti-Robinson (RBR) geometry found recently as the near-horizon limit ofthe extremal rotating Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion black holes. The solutionbreaks the $SL(2,R)\times SO(3)$ symmetry of Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetimeto $SL(2,R)\times U(1)$ and breaks supersymmetry in the sense of $N=4, d=4$supergravity as well. However, it shares with BR such properties as confinementof timelike geodesics and discreteness of the energy of test fields on thegeodesically complete manifold. Conformal mechanics governing the radialgeodesic motion coincides with that for a charged particle in the BR background(a relativistic version of the De Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model), with theazimuthal momentum playing the role of a charge. Similarly to the BR case, thetransition from Poincar\'e to global coordinates leads to a redefinition of theHamiltonian making the energy spectrum discrete. Although the metric does notsplit into a product space even asymptotically, it still admits aninfinite-dimensional extension of $SL(2,R)$ as asymptotic symmetry. The latteris shown to be given by the product of one copy of the Virasoro algebra andU(1), the same being valid for the extremal Kerr throat.
