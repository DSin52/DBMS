An analysis of a spherically symmetric braneworld configuration is performedwhen the intrinsic curvature scalar is included in the bulk action; thevanishing of the electric part of the Weyl tensor is used as the boundarycondition for the embedding of the brane in the bulk. All the solutions outsidea static localized matter distribution are found; some of them are of theSchwarzschild-(A)dS_{4} form. Two modified Oppenheimer-Volkoff interiorsolutions are also found; one is matched to a Schwarzschild-(A)dS_{4} exterior,while the other does not. A non-universal gravitational constant arises,depending on the density of the considered object; however, the conventionallimits of the Newton's constant are recovered. An upper bound of the order ofTeV for the energy string scale is extracted from the known solar systemmeasurements (experiments). On the contrary, in usual brane dynamics, thisstring scale is calculated to be larger than TeV.
