A U(N) Chern-Simons theory on noncommutative $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is constructedthe BRST-symmetry and the topological linear vector supersymmetry. It is shownthat the theory is finite and $\q_{\m\n}$-independent at the one loop level andthat the calculations respect the restriction of the topological supersymmetry.Thus the topological $\q$-deformed Chern-Simons theory is an example of a modelwhich is non-singular in the limit $\q \to 0$.
