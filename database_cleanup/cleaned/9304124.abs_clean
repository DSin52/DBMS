Title: On a Jordan-algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics

constructionAuthors: Wolfgang Bischoff

Comments: 12pages, latex, THEP 93/7

In this note I discuss some aspects of a formulation of quantum mechanicsbased entirely on the Jordan algebra of observables. After reviewing some factsof the formulation in the \CS -approach I present a Jordan-algebraic Hilbertspace construction (inspired by the usual GNS-construction), thereby obtaininga real Hilbert space and a (Jordan-) representation of the algebra ofobservables on this space. Taking the usual case as a guideline I subsequentlyderive a Schr\"odinger equation on this Hilbert space.
