We find a general class of rotating charged black hole solutions to N=2, D=5gauged supergravity coupled to vector supermultiplets. The supersymmetryproperties of these solutions are studied, and their mass and angular momentaare obtained. We also compute the stress tensor of the dual D=4, N=4 superYang-Mills theory in the limit of strong `t Hooft coupling. It is shown thatclosed timelike curves occur outside the horizon, indicating loss of unitarityin the dual CFT. For imaginary coupling constant of the gravitini to the gaugefields, one can obtain multi-centered rotating charged de Sitter black holes.Some physical properties of these solutions are also discussed.
