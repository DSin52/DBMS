We derive the two equations of Davey-Stewartson type from a zero curvaturecondition associated with SL(2,{\bf R}) in $2+1$ dimensions. We show in generalhow a $2+1$ dimensional zero curvature condition can be obtained from theself-duality condition in $3+3$ dimensions and show in particular how theDavey-Stewartson equations can be obtained from the self-duality conditionassociated with SL(2,{\bf R}) in $3+3$ dimensions.
