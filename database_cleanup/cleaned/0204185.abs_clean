In this paper we study the noncommutative extension of a modified U(n) sigmamodel in 2+1 dimensions. Using the method of dressing transformations, aniterative approach for the construction of solutions from a given seedsolution, we demonstrate the construction of multi-soliton andsoliton-antisoliton configurations for general n. As illustrative examples wediscuss U(3) solitons and consider the head-on collision of a U(2) soliton andan antisoliton explicitly, which will result in a 90^{\text{o}} anglescattering. Further we discuss the head-on collision of one U(2) soliton withtwo antisolitons. This results in a 60^{\text{o}} angle scattering.
