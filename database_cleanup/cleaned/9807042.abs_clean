The relationship between N-soliton solutions to the Euclidean sine-Gordonequation and Lorentzian black holes in Jackiw-Teitelboim dilaton gravity isinvestigated, with emphasis on the important role played by the dilaton indetermining the black hole geometry. We show how an N-soliton solution can beused to construct ``sine-Gordon'' coordinates for a black hole of mass M, andconstruct the transformation to more standard ``Schwarzchild-like''coordinates. For N=1 and 2, we find explicit closed form solutions to thedilaton equations of motion in soliton coordinates, and find the relationshipbetween the soliton parameters and the black hole mass. Remarkably, the blackhole mass is non-negative for arbitrary soliton parameters. In the one-solitoncase the coordinates are shown to cover smoothly a region containing the wholeinterior of the black hole as well as a finite neighbourhood outside thehorizon. A Hamiltonian analysis is performed for slicings that approach thesoliton coordinates on the interior, and it is shown that there is no boundarycontribution from the interior. Finally we speculate on the sine-Gordonsolitonic origin of black hole statistical mechanics.
