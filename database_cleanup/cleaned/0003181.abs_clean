superextensionsComments: 9 pages, LaTeX, talk given at the International Workshop

"Supersymmetry and Quantum Symmetries", JINR, Dubna, Russia, July 26-31, 1999It is shown that the method of nonlinear realization of local supersymmetrybeing applied to the n=(1,1) superconformal symmetry allows one reduce the newversion of the super-Liouville equation to the ordinary one owing to therelaxation of the auxiliary equation of motion fixing the gauge parameters.
