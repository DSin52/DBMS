Based on a path integral prescription for anomaly calculation, we analyze aneffective theory of the two-dimensional $N=2$ supergravity, i.e., $N=2$super-Liouville theory. We calculate the anomalies associated with the BRSTsupercurrent and the ghost number supercurrent. From those expressions ofanomalies, we construct covariant BRST and ghost number supercurrents in theeffective theory. We then show that the (super-)coordinate BRST current algebraforms a superfield extension of the topological conformal algebra for an {\itarbitrary\/} type of conformal matter or, in terms of the string theory, for anarbitrary number of space-time dimensions. This fact is very contrast with$N=0$ and $N=1$ (super-)Liouville theory, where the topological algebra singlesout a particular value of dimensions. Our observation suggests a topologicalnature of the two-dimensional $N=2$ supergravity as a quantum theory.
