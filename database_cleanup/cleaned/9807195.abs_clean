Title: Beyond Gauge Theories

Comments: 14 pages, latex2e; Presented at WEIN 98 in Santa Fe, NM (June 1998);

Superstring theory, and a recent extension called M theory, are leadingcandidates for a quantum theory that unifies gravity with the other forces. Assuch, they are certainly not ordinary quantum field theories. However, recentduality conjectures suggest that a more complete definition of these theoriescan be provided by the large N limits of suitably chosen U(N) gauge theoriesassociated to the asymptotic boundary of spacetime.
