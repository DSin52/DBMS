3-d Sakharov ConferenceThe complex non-local action functional is used in classical electrodynamicsto describe the back-reaction effects for the charge moving in the constanthomogeneous electromagnetic field. We apply the mass-shift method to obtain thehigher order radiation effects in the non-relativistic cyclotron motion andgeneralize the method to the case of Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi particle.
