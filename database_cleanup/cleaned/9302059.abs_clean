Title: Free field resolution for nonunitary representations of N=2

SuperVirasoroComments: 12 pages

We study N=2 SuperVirasoro SCFT for the generic value of the central charge.The main tool is the nonstandard bosonisation suggested in \ref\rRoz{L.Rozansky a letter to M. Bershadsky, 1989}, \ref\rSeBGR{B. Gato-Rivera, A.Semikhatov Phys. Letts. B293 (1992) 72},\ref\rBLNW{M. Bershadsky, W. Lerche, D.Nemeshansky, N. Warner N=2 Extended superconformal structure of Gravity and WGravity coupled to Matter HUTP-A034/92}. The free field resolutions for theirreducible representations are obtained; the characters of theserepresentations are computed. The quantum hamiltonian reduction from theKac-Moody $\hat{sl}_k(2|1)$ to N=2 $SVir$ is constructed.
