Dynamics of cylindrical and spherical relativistic domain walls isinvestigated with the help of a new method based on Taylor expansion of thescalar field in a vicinity of the core of the wall. Internal oscillatory modesfor the domain walls are found. These modes are non-analytic in the "width" ofthe domain wall. Rather non-trivial transformation to a special coordinatesystem, widely used in investigations of relativistic domain walls, is studiedin detail.
