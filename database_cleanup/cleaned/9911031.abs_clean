EffectWe propose the two formalisms for obtaining the noncommutative spacetime in amagnetic field. One is the first-order formalism and the other is thesecond-order formalism. Although the noncommutative spacetime is realizedmanifestly in the first-order formalism, the second-order formalism would bemore useful for calculating the physical quantities in the noncommutativegeometry than the first-order one. Several interesting points for string theoryand fractional quantum Hall effect are discussed. In particular, we point outthat the noncommutative geometry is closely related to the fractional quantumHall effect(FQHE).
