Higher order coefficients of the inverse mass expansion of one-loop effectiveactions are obtained from a one-dimensional path integral representation. Forthe case of a massive scalar loop in the background of both a scalar potentialand a (non Abelian) gauge field explicit results to $O(T^5)$ in the proper timeparameter are presented.
