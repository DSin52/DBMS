Title: Geodesic Flow on the n-Dimensional Ellipsoid as a Liouville Integrable

SystemComments: Latex, 8 pages, no figures

We show that the motion on the n-dimensional ellipsoid is complete integrableby exhibiting n integrals in involution. The system is separable at classicaland quantum level, the separation of classical variables being realized by theinverse of the momentum map. This system is a generic one in a new class ofn-dimensional complete integrable Hamiltonians defined by an arbitrary functionf(q,p) invertible with respect to momentum p and rational in the coordinate q.
