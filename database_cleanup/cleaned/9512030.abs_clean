The symmetric space sine-Gordon models arise by conformal reduction ofordinary 2-dim $\sigma$-models, and they are integrable exhibiting a black-holetype metric in target space. We provide a Lagrangian formulation of thesesystems by considering a triplet of Lie groups $F \supset G \supset H$. We showthat for every symmetric space $F/G$, the generalized sine-Gordon models can bederived from the $G/H$ WZW action, plus a potential term that is algebraicallyspecified. Thus, the symmetric space sine-Gordon models describe certainintegrable perturbations of coset conformal field theories at the classicallevel. We also briefly discuss their vacuum structure, Backlundtransformations, and soliton solutions.
