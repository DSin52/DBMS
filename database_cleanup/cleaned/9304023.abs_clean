We construct an $SO(10)$ grand unified theory in the formulation ofnon-com-\break mutative geometry. The geometry of space-time is that of aproduct of a continuos four dimensional manifold times a discrete set ofpoints. The properties of the fermionic sector fix almost uniquely the Higgsstructure. The simplest model corresponds to the case where the discrete setconsists of three points and the Higgs fields are ${\u {16}_s}\times\overline{\u {16}}_s$ and ${\u {16}_s}\times {\u {16}_s} $. The requirementthat the scalar potential for all the Higgs fields not vanish imposes strongrestrictions on the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs fields and thus thefermion masses. We show that it is possible to remove these constraints byextending the number of discrete points and adding a singlet fermion and a ${\u{16}_s}$ Higgs field. Both models are studied in detail.
