The problem of renormalisability of the SU(n) theory with massive gaugebosons is reinverstigated in the present work. We expound that the quantizationunder the Lorentz condition caused by the mass term of the gauge fields leadsto a ghost action which is the same as that of the usual SU(n) Yang-Millstheory in the Landau gauge. Furthermore, we clarify that the mass term of thegauge fields cause no additional complexity to the Slavnov-Taylor identity ofthe generating functional for the regular vertex functions and does not changethe equations satisfied by the divergent part of this generating functional.Finally, we prove that the renormalisability of the theory can be deduced fromthe renormalisability of the Yang-Mills theory.
