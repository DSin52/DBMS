It is shown, that in the general case the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation(reduction of $4d$ oscillator on the twistor space by the Hamiltonian action of$U(1)$ with further time-reparametrization) leads to the integrable system,describing the interaction of a spinless electrically charged particle with adyon .
