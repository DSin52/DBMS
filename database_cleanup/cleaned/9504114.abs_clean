Using mirror symmetry in Calabi-Yau manifolds M, three point functions ofA(M)-model operators on the genus $0$ Riemann surface in cases of one-parameterfamilies of $d$-folds realized as Fermat type hypersurfaces embedded inweighted projective spaces and a two-parameter family of $d$-fold embedded in aweighted projective space ${\amb}$ are studied. These three point functions${\corr{\,{{\cal O}^{(1)}_{a}}\, {{\cal O}^{(l-1)}_{b}}\, {{\calO}^{(d-l)}_{c}}\, }}$ are expanded by indeterminates ${q_l}$=${e^{2\pi i{t_l}}}$ associated with a set of {\kae} coordinates $\{{t_l}\}$ and theirexpansion coefficients count the number of maps. From these analyses, we canread fusion structure of Calabi-Yau A(M)-model operators. In our cases theyconstitute a subring of a total quantum cohomology ring of the A(M)-modeloperators. In fact we switch off all perturbation operators on the topologicaltheories except for marginal ones associated with {\kae} forms of M. For thatreason, the charge conservation of operators turns out to be a classical one.
