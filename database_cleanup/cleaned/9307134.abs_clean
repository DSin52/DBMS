Title: Optimal Photon Localization

Authors: J. Mourad

Comments: 6 pages

We show that there is only one operator having some minimal propertiesenabling it to be a one photon position operator. These proerties are stated,and the solution is shown to be the photon position operator proposed by Pryce.This operator has non-commuting components. Nevertheless, it is shown that onecan find states localized with an arbitrary precision.
