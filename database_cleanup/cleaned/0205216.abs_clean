We obtain the correct all-loop beta-function of pure N=1 super Yang-Millstheory from the supergravity solution of the warped deformed conifold,including also some nonperturbative corrections. The crucial ingredient is thegauge-gravity relation that can be inferred by taking into account thephenomenon of gaugino condensation.
