We study systematically the higher order corrections to the parity violatingpart of the effective action for the Abelian Chern-Simons theory in 2+1dimensions, using the method of derivative expansion. We explicitly calculatethe parity violating parts of the quadratic, cubic and the quartic terms (infields) of the effective action. We show that each of these actions can besummed, in principle, to all orders in the derivatives. However, such astructure is complicated and not very useful. On the other hand, at every orderin the powers of the derivatives, we show that the effective action can also besummed to all orders in the fields. The resulting actions can be expressed interms of the leading order effective action in the static limit. We prove gaugeinvariance, both large and small of the resulting effective actions. Variousother features of the theory are also brought out.
