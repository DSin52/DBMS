Massless Scalar FieldAuthors: Youngjai Kiem

Comments: 9 pages,PUPT-1484

Phase transition in spherically symmetric collapse of a massless scalar fieldis studied in 4-d Einstein gravity. A class of exact solutions that show theevolution of a constant incoming energy flux turned on at a point in the pastnull infinity are constructed to serve as an explicit example. The recentlydiscovered phase transition in this system via numerical methods\cite{choptuik} is manifest; above a threshold value of the incooming energyflux, a black hole is dynamically formed and below that, the incoming flux isreflected forward into the future null infinity. The critical exponent isevaluated and discussed using the solutions.
