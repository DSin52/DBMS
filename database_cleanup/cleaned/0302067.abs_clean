Title: Sidestepping the Cosmological Constant with Football-Shaped Extra

DimensionsAuthors: Sean M. Carroll and Monica M. Guica

We present an exact solution for a factorizable brane-world spacetime withtwo extra dimensions and explicit brane sources. The compactification manifoldhas the topology of a two-sphere, and is stabilized by a bulk cosmologicalconstant and magnetic flux. The geometry of the sphere is locally round exceptfor conical singularities at the locations of two antipodal branes, deformingthe sphere into an American-style football. The bulk magnetic flux needs to befine-tuned to obtain flat geometry on the branes. Once this is done, the branegeometry is insensitive to the brane vacuum energy, which only affects theconical deficit angle of the extra dimensions. Solutions of this form provide anew arena in which to explore brane-world phenomenology and the effects ofextra dimensions on the cosmological constant problem.
