$\chat=1$ fermionic string theory, which is considered as a fermionic stringtheory in two dimension, is shown to decompose into two mutually independentparts, one of which can be viewed as a topological model and the other isirrelevant for the theory. The physical contents of the theory is largelygoverned by this topological structure, and the discrete physical spectrum of$\chat=1$ string theory is naturally explained as the physical spectrum of thetopological model. This topological structure turns out to be related with anovel hidden $N=2$ superconformal algebra (SCA) in the enveloping algebra ofthe $N=3$ SCA in fermionic string theories.
