We investigate the nucleation of circular cosmic strings in models ofgeneralized inflationary universes with an accelerating scale factor. Weconsider toy cosmological models of a smooth inflationary exit and transitioninto a flat Minkowski spacetime. Our results establish that an inflationaryexpanding phase is necessary but not sufficient for quantum nucleation ofcircular cosmic strings to occur.
