We discuss mirror symmetry in generalized Calabi-Yau compactifications oftype II string theories with background NS fluxes. Starting from type IIBcompactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds with NS three-form flux we show that themirror type IIA theory arises from a purely geometrical compactification on adifferent class of six-manifolds. These mirror manifolds have SU(3) structureand are termed half-flat; they are neither complex nor Ricci-flat and theirholonomy group is no longer SU(3). We show that type IIA appropriatelycompactified on such manifolds gives the correct mirror-symmetric low-energyeffective action.
