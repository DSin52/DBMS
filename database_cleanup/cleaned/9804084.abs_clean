We first review the interpretation of world-sheet defects as $D$ branesdescribed by a critical theory in 11 dimensions, that we interpret as $M$theory. We then show that $D$-brane recoil induces dynamically ananti-de-Sitter (AdS) space-time background, with criticality restored by atwelfth time-like dimension described by a Liouville field. Local physics inthe bulk of this AdS$_{11}$ may be described by an $Osp(1|32,R) \otimesOsp(1|32,R)$ topological gauge theory (TGT), with non-local boundary states indoubleton representations. We draw analogies with structures previouslyexhibited in two-dimensional black-hole models. Wilson loops of `matter' in theTGT may be described by an effective string action, and defect condensation mayyield string tension and cause a space-time metric to appear.
