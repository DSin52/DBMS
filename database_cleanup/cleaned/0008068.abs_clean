We consider scattering of electromagnetic plane waves on a D3-brane spikewhich emanates normal to D3-barne in the extra space direction. We areinterested in studying physical effects on D3-brane which are produced by aspike attached to D3-brane. We have observed that the spike sucks almost allelectromagnetic radiation and therefore acts like a black hole. This is becauseabsorption cross section for j=1 tends to a constant at low energy limit. Thisbehaviour is appealing for a string interpretation of the spike soliton becausethe propagation of $j=1$ mode is indeed distinctive. Instead, the scatteredpart of the radiation on a D3-brane tends to zero demonstrating non-Thompsonbehaviour.
