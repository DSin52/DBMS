We investigate duality transformations in a class of backgrounds withnon-Abelian isometries, i.e. Bianchi-type (homogeneous) cosmologies inarbitrary dimensions. Simple duality transformations for the metric and theantisymmetric tensor field, generalizing those known from the Abelian isometry(Bianchi I) case, are obtained using either a Lagrangian or a Hamiltonianapproach. Applying these prescriptions to a specific conformally invariant$\s$-model, we show that no dilaton transformation leads to a new conformalbackground. Some possible ways out of the problem are suggested.
