The highest weight modules of the chiral algebra of orthogonal WZW models atlevel one possess a realization in fermionic representation spaces; theKac-Moody and Virasoro generators are represented as unbounded limits of evenCAR algebras. It is shown that the representation theory of the underlying evenCAR algebras reproduces precisely the sectors of the chiral algebra. This factallows to develop a theory of local von Neumann algebras on the puncturedcircle, fitting nicely in the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts framework. The relevantlocalized endomorphisms which generate the charged sectors are explicitlyconstructed by means of Bogoliubov transformations. Using CAR theory, thefusion rules in terms of sector equivalence classes are proven.
