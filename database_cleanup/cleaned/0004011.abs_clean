We consider systems of D6 branes in the presence of a nonzero $B$ field ofdifferent ranks. We study the scattering of gravitons in the correspondingsupergravity backgrounds. We show that the nonzero $B$ field does not modifythe form of the scattering potential. The graviton scattering equation has twosolutions one normalizable and one non-normalizable. The normalizable solutiondoes not lead to an absorption, however the non-normalizable one does. Weanalyse the absorption of gravitons by the branes and show that it is nonzeroin the decoupling limit. This result suggests that even in the presence of a$B$ field the D6 branes worldvolume theory does not decouple from the bulkgravity. For comparison we analyse the form of the scattering potential andabsorption for Dp branes with $p <5$ and for NS5 branes.
