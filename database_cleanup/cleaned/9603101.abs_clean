Gauged linear sigma models with C^m-valued scalar fields and gauge groupU(1)^d, d \leq m, have soliton solutions of Bogomol'nyi type if a suitablychosen potential for the scalar fields is also included in the Lagrangian. Heresuch models are studied on (2+1)-dimensional Minkowski space. If the dynamicsof the gauge fields is governed by a Maxwell term the appropriate potential isa sum of generalised Higgs potentials known as Fayet-Iliopoulos D-terms. Manyinteresting topological solitons of Bogomol'nyi type arise in models of thiskind, including various types of vortices (e.g. Nielsen-Olesen, semilocal andsuperconducting vortices) as well as, in certain limits, textures (e.g.CP^(m-1) textures and gauged CP^(m-1) textures). This is explained and generalresults about the spectrum of topological defects both for broken and partiallybroken gauge symmetry are proven. When the dynamics of the gauge fields isgoverned by a Chern-Simons term instead of a Maxwell term a different scalarpotential is required for the theory to be of Bogomol'nyi type. The generalform of that potential is given and a particular example is discussed.
