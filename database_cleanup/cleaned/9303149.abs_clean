We investigate the fractal structure of $2d$ quantum gravity, both for puregravity and for gravity coupled to multiple gaussian fields and for gravitycoupled to Ising spins. The roughness of the surfaces is described in terms ofbaby universes and using numerical simulations we measure their distributionwhich is related to the string susceptibility exponent $\g_{string}$.
