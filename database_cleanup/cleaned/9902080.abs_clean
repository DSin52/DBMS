Recently a TeV-scale Supersymmetric Standard Model (TSSM) was proposed inwhich the gauge coupling unification is as precise (at one loop) as in theMSSM, and occurs in the TeV range. Proton stability in the TSSM is due to ananomaly free Z_3 X Z_3 discrete gauge symmetry, which is also essential forsuccessfully generating neutrino masses in the desirable range. In this paperwe show that the TSSM admits anomaly free non-Abelian discrete flavor gaugesymmetries (based on a left-right product tetrahedral group) which togetherwith a ``vector-like'' Abelian (discrete) flavor gauge symmetry suppressesdangerous higher dimensional operators corresponding to flavor changing neutralcurrents (FCNCs) to an acceptable level. Discrete flavor gauge symmetries aremore advantageous compared with continuous flavor gauge symmetries as thelatter must be broken, which generically results in unacceptably large gaugemediated flavor violation. In contrast, in the case of discrete flavor gaugesymmetries the only possibly dangerous sources of flavor violation either comefrom the corresponding ``bulk'' flavon (that is, flavor symmetry breakingHiggs) exchanges, or are induced by flavon VEVs. These sources of flavorviolation, however, are adequately suppressed by the above flavor gaugesymmetries for the string scale \sim 10-100 TeV
