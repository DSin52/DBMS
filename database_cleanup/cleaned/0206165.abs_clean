The heterotic string free fermionic formulation produced a large class ofthree generation models, with an underlying SO(10) GUT symmetry which is brokendirectly at the string level by Wilson lines. A common subset of boundarycondition basis vectors in these models is the NAHE set, which corresponds toZ2 X Z2 orbifold of an SO(12) Narain lattice, with (h11,h21)=(27,3).Alternatively, a manifold with the same data is obtained by starting with a Z2X Z2 orbifold at a generic point on the lattice, with (h11,h21)=(51,3), andadding a freely acting Z2 involution. The equivalence of the two constructionsis proven by examining the relevant partition functions. The explicitrealization of the shift that reproduces the compactification at the freefermionic point is found. It is shown that other closely related shiftsreproduce the same massless spectrum, but different massive spectrum, thusdemonstrating the utility of extracting information from the full partitionfunction. A freely acting involution of the type discussed here, enables theuse of Wilson lines to break the GUT symmetry and can be utilized innon-perturbative studies of the free fermionic models.
