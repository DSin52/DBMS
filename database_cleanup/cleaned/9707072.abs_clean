The complete, missing, Hamiltonian treatment of the standard SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)model with Grassmann-valued fermion fields in the Higgs phase is given. Webypass the complications of the Hamiltonian theory in the Higgs phase,resulting from the spontaneous symmetry breaking with the Higgs mechanism, bystudying the Hamiltonian formulation of the Higgs phase for the gaugeequivalent Lagrangian in the unitary gauge. A canonical basis of Dirac'sobservables is found and the reduced physical Hamiltonian is evaluated. Itsself-energy part is nonlocal for the electromagnetic and strong interactions,but local for the weak ones. Therefore, the Fermi 4-fermion interactionreappears at the nonperturbative level.
