The coupling of $N=1$ SCFT of type $(4m,2)$ to two-dimensional supergravitycan be formulated non-perturbatively in terms of a discrete super-eigenvaluemodel proposed by Alvarez-Gaum\'e, et al. We derive the superloop equationsthat describe, in the double scaling limit, the non-perturbative solution ofthis model. These equations are equivalent to the double scaled super-Virasoroconstraints satisfied by the partition function. They are formulated in termsof a $\widehat c=1$ theory, with a $\IZ_2$-twisted scalar field and aWeyl-Majorana fermion in the Ramond sector. We have solved the superloopequations to all orders in the genus expansion and obtained the explicitexpressions for the correlation functions of gravitationally dressed scalingoperators in the NS- and R-sector. In the double scaling limit, we obtain aformulation of the model in terms of a new supersymmetric extension of the KdVhierarchy.
