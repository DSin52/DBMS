Journal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 45 (1997) 589-626

The classical and quantum aspects of the Schwinger model on the torus areconsidered. First we find explicitly all zero modes of the Dirac operator inthe topological sectors with nontrivial Chern index and is spectrum. In thesecond part we determine the regularized effective action and discuss thepropagators related to it.Finally we calculate the gauge invariant averages of the fermion bilinearsand correlation functions of currents and densities. We show that in theinfinite volume limit the well-known result for the chiral condensate can beobtained and the clustering property can be established.
