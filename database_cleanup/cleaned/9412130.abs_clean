We give an algebraic proof of the spin-statistics connection for theparabosonic and parafermionic quantum topological charges of a theory of localobservables with a modular PCT-symmetry. The argument avoids the use of thespinor calculus and also works in 1+2 dimensions. It is expected to be aprogress towards a general spin-statistics theorem including also(1+2)-dimensional theories with braid group statistics.
