Title: De Rham-Kodaira's Theorem and Dual Gauge Transformations

Comments: 22pages, Latex

A general action is proposed for the fields of $q$-dimensional differentialform over the compact Riemannian manifold of arbitrary dimensions. Mathematicaltools are based on the well-known de Rham-Kodaira decomposing theorem onharmonic integral. A field-theoretic action for strings, $p$-branes andhigh-spin fields is naturally derived. We also have, naturally, the generalizedMaxwell equations with an electromagnetic and monopole current on a curvedspace-time. A new type of gauge transformations ({\it dual} gaugetransformations) plays an essential role for coboundary $q$-forms.
