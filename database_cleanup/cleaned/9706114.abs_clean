Authors: V.V. Tugai, A.A. Zheltukhin

Comments: 6 pages REVTeX (talk at the seminar "Supersymmetry and quantum field

theory" dedicated to the memory of Acad. Dmitrij Volkov, Kharkov, Jan. 1997)Incorect sign in last line of formula (15) is corrected. Information aboutgovernment and international grants is addedA possibility of an extension of the minimality principle for electromagneticinteractions of charged and neutral particles having spin 1/2 is investigated.
