Title: Twisting of quantum (super)algebras. Connection of Drinfeld's and

Cartan-Weyl realizations for quantum affine algebrasUniversity)Comments: 28 pages

We show that some factors of the universal R-matrix generate a family oftwistings for the standard Hopf structure of any quantized contragredient Lie(super)algebra of finite growth. As an application we prove that any twoisomorphic superalgebras with different Cartan matrices have isomorphicq-deformations (as associative superalgebras) and their standardcomultiplications are connected by such twisting. We present also an explicitrelation between the generators of the second Drinfeld's realization andCartan-Weyl generators of quantized affine nontwisted Kac-Moody algebras.Further development of the theory of quantum Cartan-Weyl basis, closely relatedwith this isomorphism, is discussed. We show that Drinfeld's formulas of acomultiplication for the second realization are a twisting of the standardcomultiplication by factors of the universal R-matrix. Finally, properties ofthe Drinfeld's comultiplication are considered.
