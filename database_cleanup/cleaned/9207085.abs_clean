Deviations from scale invariance resulting from small perturbations of ageneral two dimensional conformal field theory are studied. They are expressedin terms of beta functions for renormalization of general couplings under localchange of scale. The beta functions for homogeneous background are givenperturbatively in terms of the data of the original conformal theory withoutany specific assumptions on its nature. The renormalization of couplings toprimary operators and to first descendents is considered as well as that ofcouplings of a dilatonic type which involve explicit dependence on world sheetcurvature.
