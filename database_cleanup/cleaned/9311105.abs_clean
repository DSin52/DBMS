A system of electrons in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with Coulombinteractions is described by a renormalizable quantum field theory similar butnot equal to QED_3. Renormalization group techniques are used to investigatethe infrared behaviour of the system that flows to a fixed point with non-Fermiliquid characteristics. There are anomalous dimensions in the fermionicobservables, no quasiparticle pole, and anomalous screening of the Coulombinteraction. These results are robust as the Fermi level is not changed by theinteraction. The system resembles in the infrared the one-dimensional Luttingerliquid.
