As a step toward constructing realistic brane world models in string theory,we consider the interactions of a pair of non-BPS branes. We construct a dyonicgeneralization of the non-BPS branes first constructed by Bergman, Gaberdieland Sen as orbifolds of D-branes on $T^4/\BZ_2$. The force between a dyonicbrane and an electric brane is computed and is found to vanish at a nontrivialcritical separation. This equilibrium point is unstable. For smallerseparations the branes coalesce to form a composite dyonic state, while forlarger separations the branes run off to infinity. We suggest generalizationsthat will lead to potentials with stable local minima.
