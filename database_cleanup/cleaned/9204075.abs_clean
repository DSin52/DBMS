We consider the low energy limit of three dimensional Quantum Chromodynamicswith an even number of flavors. We show that Parity is not spontaneouslybroken, but the global (flavor) symmetry is spontaneously broken. The lowenergy effective lagrangian is a nonlinear sigma model on the Grassmannian.Some Chern--Simons terms are necessary in the lagrangian to realize thediscrete symmetries correctly. We consider also another parametrization of thelow energy sector which leads to a three dimensional analogue of theWess--Zumino--Witten--Novikov model. Since three dimensional QCD is believed tobe a model for quantum anti--ferromagnetism, our effective lagrangian candescribe their long wavelength excitations (spin waves).
