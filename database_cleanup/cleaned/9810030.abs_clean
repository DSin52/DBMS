Authors: M.I. Gorenstein, V.P. Shelest, Yu.A. Sitenko, G.M. Zinovjev

1973Statistical method is applied to Neveu and Schwartz model for obtaining thewidths etc. The properties of the dual model spectrum of states constructed ofboth commuting and anticommuting operators are considered. In this case thespin characteristics coincide with the results of the statistical bootstrapmodel.
