Authors: Paolo Pasti, Dmitri Sorokin and Mario Tonin

Comments: LaTeX2e file, 10 pages. Based on talks given at the E. S. Fradkin

Memorial Conference "Quantization, Gauge Theory and Strings", Moscow, June5-10, 2000 and at the European RTN Network Conference "The quantum structureof spacetime and the geometric nature of fundamental interactions", Berlin,October 4-10, 2000Journal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 49 (2001) 649-656

The geometrical (superembedding) approach is used as a tool for deriving fromthe worldvolume dynamics of superbranes field theoretical models exhibitingpartial supersymmetry breaking. In this way we obtain nonlinear actions forGoldstone superfields associated with physical degrees of freedom of thesuperbranes.
