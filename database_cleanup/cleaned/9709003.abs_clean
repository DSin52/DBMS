We describe gauge-fixing at the level of virtual paths in the path integralas a non-symplectic BRST-type of flow on the path phase space. As a consequencea gauge-fixed, non-local symplectic structure arises. Restoring of locality isdiscussed. A pertinent anti-Lie-bracket and an infinite dimensional group ofgauge fermions are introduced. Generalizations to Sp(2)-symmetric BLT-theoriesare made.
