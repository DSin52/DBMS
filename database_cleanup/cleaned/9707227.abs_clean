The algebra of linear and quadratic functions of basic observables on thephase space of either the free particle or the harmonic oscillator possesses afinite-dimensional anomaly. The quantization of these systems outside thecritical values of the anomaly leads to a new degree of freedom which sharesits internal character with spin, but nevertheless features an infinite numberof different states. Both are associated with the transformation properties ofwave functions under the Weyl-symplectic group $WSp(6,\Re)$. The physicalmeaning of this new degree of freedom can be established, with a major scope,only by analysing the quantization of an infinite-dimensional algebra ofdiffeomorphisms generalizing string symmetry and leading to more generalextended objects.
