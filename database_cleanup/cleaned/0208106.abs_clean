The systematization of the purely Lagrangean approach to constrained systemsin the form of an algorithm involves the iterative construction of ageneralized Hessian matrix W taking a rectangular form. This Hessian willexhibit as many left zero-modes as there are Lagrangean constraints in thetheory. We apply this approach to a general Lagrangean in the first orderformulation and show how the seemingly overdetermined set of equations issolved for the velocities by suitably extending W to a rectangular matrix. As abyproduct we thereby demonstrate the equivalence of the Lagrangean approach tothe traditional Dirac-approach. By making use of this equivalence we show thata recently proposed symplectic algorithm does not necessarily reproduce thefull constraint structure of the traditional Dirac algorithm.
