Serious misprint corrections on equations and on figure captionClassical Electrodynamics is not a consistent theory because of its fieldinadequate behaviour in the vicinity of their sources. Its problems with theelectron equation of motion and with non-integrable singularity of the electronself field and of its stress tensor are well known. These inconsistencies areeliminated if the discrete and localized (classical photons) character of theelectromagnetic interaction is anticipatively recognized already in a classicalcontext. This is possible, in a manifestly covariant way, with a new model ofspacetime structure, shown in a previous paper $^{1}$, that invalidates theLorentz-Dirac equation. For a point classical electron there is no fieldsingularity, no causality violation and no conflict with energy conservation inthe electron equation of motion. The electromagnetic field must bere-interpreted in terms of average flux of classical photons. Implications of asingularity-free formalism to field theory are discussed.
