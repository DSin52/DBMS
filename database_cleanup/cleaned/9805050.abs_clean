A 5D black hole(M$_5$) is investigated in the type IIB superstring theorycompactified on S$^1 \times $T$^4$. This corresponds to AdS$_3 \times $S$^3\times $T$^4$ in the near horizon with asymptotically flat space. Here theharmonic gauge is introduced to decouple the mixing between the dilaton andothers. On the other hand we obtain the BTZ balckhole(AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$) as the non-dilatonic solution. We calculatethe greybody factor of the dilaton as a test scalar both for a 5D blackhole(M$_5 \times $S$^1 \times $T$^4$) and the BTZ black hole(AdS$_3 \times$S$^3 \times $T$^4$). The result of the BTZ black hole agrees with the greybodyfactor of the dilaton in the dilute gas approximation of a 5D black hole.
