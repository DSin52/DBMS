The fermionic sector of the Standard Model of Elementary Particles emerges asthe low energy limit of a single fermionic field freely propagating in a higherdimensional background. The local geometrical framework is obtained byenforcing at a space-time level the whole gauge group SO(1,3) x U(1) x SU(2) xSU(3) associated to fundamental interactions; equivalently, by assuming thatinternal gauge transformations are indeed local space-time transformations. Thegeometry naturally embodies freedoms corresponding to gravitational andnon-gravitational gauge fields. As a consequence of the fact that thestructural group is in part unitary, the motion of test particles getsautomatically squeezed on an effective 1+3 space-time. Dimensional reductiontakes place without compactification. In close analogy to the specialrelativistic mass-energy relation, the theory associates to every elementaryparticle an intrinsic energy presumably of the order of the Planck scale. Thetheory predicts the existence of a right-handed component of the neutrino andindicates the possibility of an extra U(1) gauge interaction.
