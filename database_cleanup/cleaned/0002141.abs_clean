Title: Superspace Representations of SU(2,2/N) Superalgebras and Multiplet

ShorteningAuthors: S. Ferrara (CERN, TH Division)

Comments: Talk given at the TMR Conference on Quantum Aspects of Gauge

Theories, Supersymmetry and Unification, Paris, 1-7 September 1999We derive massless and massive representations of all SU(2,2/N) superalgebrasby using superfields defined in "harmonic superspace". This method allows oneto easily construct "short superfields" which are relevant in the analysis ofthe AdS/CFT correspondence.
