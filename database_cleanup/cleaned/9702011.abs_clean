We consider theories with a spontaneously broken gauged R-symmetry, which canonly occur in supergravity models. These give rise to cosmic R-strings uponwhich gravitino zero modes can exist. We construct solutions to theRarita-Schwinger spin-3/2 equation describing the gravitino in the field ofthese cosmic strings and show that under some conditions these solutions maygive rise to gravitino currents on the string. We discuss further mathematicaland physical questions associated with these solutions.
