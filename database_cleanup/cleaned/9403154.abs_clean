We show that the differential complex $\Omega_{B}$ over the braided matrixalgebra $BM_{q}(N)$ represents a covariant comodule with respect to thecoaction of the Hopf algebra $\Omega_{A}$ which is a differential extension of$GL_{q}(N)$. On the other hand, the algebra $\Omega_{A}$ is a covariant braidedcomodule with respect to the coaction of the braided Hopf algebra $\Omega_{B}$.Geometrical aspects of these results are discussed.
