We discuss superparticle and superstring dynamics in AdS_3 x S^3 supported byR-R 3-form background using light-cone gauge approach. Starting with thesuperalgebra psu(1,1|2) + psu(1,1|2) representing the basic symmetry of thisbackground we find the light-cone superparticle Hamiltonian. We determine theharmonic decomposition of light-cone superfield describing fluctuations of typeIIB supergravity fields expanded near AdS_3 x S^3 background and compute thecorresponding Kaluza-Klein spectrum. We fix the fermionic and bosoniclight-cone gauges in the covariant Green-Schwarz AdS_3 x S^3 superstring actionand find the light-cone string Hamiltonian. We also obtain a realization of thegenerators of psu(1,1|2) + psu(1,1|2) in terms of the superstring 2-d fields inthe light-cone gauge.
