A correction to the Hamiltonian of the quark-antiquark system, arising due tothe rigidity term in the gluodynamics string effective action, is obtained.This correction contains additional contributions to the orbital momentum ofthe system and several higher derivative operators. With the help of thederived Hamiltonian a rigid string-induced term in the Hamiltonian of therelativistic quark model is evaluated for the case of large masses of a quarkand antiquark.
