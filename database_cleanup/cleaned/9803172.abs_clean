We study the problem of axial and gauge anomalies in a reducible theoryinvolving vector and tensor gauge fields coupled in a topological way. Weconsider that vector and axial fermionic currents couple with the tensor fieldin the same topological manner as the vector gauge one. This kind of couplingleads to an anomalous axial current, contrarily to the results found inliterature involving other tensor couplings, where no anomaly is obtained.
