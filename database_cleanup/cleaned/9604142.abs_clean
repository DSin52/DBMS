Title: A Geometry for Multidimensional Integrable Systems

Comments: LaTeX, 29 pages. To be published in J.Geom.Phys

SystemsA deformed differential calculus is developed based on an associativestar-product. In two dimensions the Hamiltonian vector fields model the algebraof pseudo-differential operator, as used in the theory of integrable systems.Thus one obtains a geometric description of the operators. A dual theory isalso possible, based on a deformation of differential forms. This calculus isapplied to a number of multidimensional integrable systems, such as the KPhierarchy, thus obtaining a geometrical description of these systems. The limitin which the deformation disappears corresponds to taking the dispersionlesslimit in these hierarchies.
