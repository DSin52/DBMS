We study instanton effects in theories with compact extra dimensions. Weperform an instanton calculation in a 5d theory on a circle of radius R, withgauge, scalar, and fermion fields in the bulk of the extra dimension. We showthat, depending on the matter content, instantons of size rho << R can dominatethe amplitude. Using deconstruction as an ultraviolet definition of the theoryallows us to show, in a controlled approximation, that for a small number ofbulk fermions, the amplitude for small size instantons exponentially grows ase^{O(1)R/rho}.
