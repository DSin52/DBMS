The simplest non-trivial solutions of WDVV equations are A_n andB_n-potentials, which describe metrics of K.Saito on spaces of versaldeformation of A_n and B_n-singularities. These are some polynomials, whichwere known for $n\leqslant$ 4. We find some recurrence relations, which give apossibility to find all A_n and B_n-potentials. In passing we give recurrenceformulas for coefficients of dispersionless KP hierarchy.
