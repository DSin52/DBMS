Title: On the Three-dimensional Lattice Model

Authors: Zhan-Ning Hu

Comments: 8 pages, latex, 4 figures

Using the restricted star-triangle relation, it is shown that the $N$-statespin integrable model on a three-dimensional lattice with spins interactinground each elementary cube of the lattice proposed by Mangazeev, Sergeev andStroganov is a particular case of the Bazhanov-Baxter model.
