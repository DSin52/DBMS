Title: Current Algebras in $3+1$ dimensions

Authors: Jouko Mickelsson

Comments: talk given at the XIX Internat. Colloq. on Group Theoretical Methods

in Physics, Salamanca, July 1992, 4 pagesAspects of a generalized representation theory of current algebras in $3+1$dimensions are discussed in terms of the Fock bundle method, the sesquilinearform approach (of Langmann and Ruijsenaars), and Hilbert space cocycles.
