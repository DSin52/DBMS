By considering the B-field dynamical and studying its interaction withRamond-Ramond (RR) background we observe the breaking of the B-field gaugesymmetry in the effective action. This effect takes place due tonon-perturbative coupling of the B-field to membrane topological charge. As aresult, the B-field is renormalized in the RR backgrounds, making it impossibleto obtain consistent non-commutative models with constant B-field.We argue that the gauge invariance is restored by introducing appropriateexternal D-brane configuration.
