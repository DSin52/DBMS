Title: Quantum deformations for the diagonal R-matrices

Comments: 6 pages, Talk at Workshop on Supersymmetry and Quantum Groups, Dubna,

15-20 July 1993We consider two different types of deformations for the linear group $ GL(n)$which correspond to using of a general diagonal R-matrix. Relations betweenbraided and quantum deformed algebras and their coactions on a quantum planeare discussed. We show that tensor-grading-preserving differential calculi canbe constructed on braided groups , quantum groups and quantum planes for thecase of the diagonal R-matrix.
