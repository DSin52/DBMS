The basic mathematical assumptions for autonomous linear kinetic equationsfor a classical system are formulated, leading to the conclusion that if theyare differential equations on its phase space $M$, they are at most of the 2ndorder. For open systems interacting with a bath at canonical equilibrium theyhave a particular form of an equation of a generalized Fokker-Planck type. Weshow that it is possible to obtain them as Liouville equations of Hamiltoniandynamics on $M$ with a particular non-commutative differential structure,provided certain geometric in character, conditions are fulfilled. To this end,symplectic geometry on $M$ is developped in this context, and an outline of therequired tensor analysis and differential geometry is given. Certain questionsfor the possible mathematical interpretation of this structure are alsodiscussed.
