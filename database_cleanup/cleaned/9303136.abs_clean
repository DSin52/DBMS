An invariant definition of the operator $\Delta $ of the Batalin-Vilkoviskyformalism is proposed. It is defined as the divergence of a Hamiltonian vectorfield with an odd Poisson bracket (antibracket). Its main properties, whichfollow from this definition, as well as an example of realization onK\"ahlerian supermanifolds, are considered. The geometrical meaning of theBatalin-Vilkovisky formalism is discussed.
