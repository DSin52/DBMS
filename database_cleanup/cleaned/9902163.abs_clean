Authors: P.Pronin and K.Stepanyantz

Comments: 22 pages, LATEX, 1 eps figure

We investigate nonperturbative effects in N=1 supersymmetric theories andpropose a new expression for the effective action, which correctly reproducesquantum anomalies and agrees with the transformation law of instanton measure.Actually the result is a nonperturbative extension of Veneziano-Yankielowitcheffective Lagrangian. The possibility of integrating out the gluino condensateis discussed.
