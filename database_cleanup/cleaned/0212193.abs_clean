Authors: Ofer Aharony

Comments: 27 pages, lecture notes from the Cargese 2002 summer school. v2

references addedIn these lecture notes from the 2002 Cargese summer school we review theprogress that has been made towards finding a string theory for QCD (or forpure (super)Yang-Mills theory) following the discovery of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence. We start with a brief review of the AdS/CFT correspondence anda general discussion of its application to the construction of a string theoryfor QCD. We then discuss in detail two possible paths towards a QCD stringtheory, one which uses a mass deformation of the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory(the Polchinski-Strassler background) and the other using a compactification of"little string theory" on a 2-sphere (the Maldacena-Nunez solution). A thirdapproach (the Klebanov-Strassler solution) is described in other lectures ofthis school. We briefly assess the advantages and disadvantages of all threeapproaches.
