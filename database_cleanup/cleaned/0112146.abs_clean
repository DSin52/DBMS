Connes and Kreimer have discovered a Hopf algebra structure behindrenormalization of Feynman integrals. We generalize the Hopf algebra to thecase of ribbon graphs, i.e. to the case of theories with matrix fields. TheHopf algebra is naturally defined in terms of surfaces corresponding to ribbongraphs. As an example, we discuss renormalization of $\Phi^4$ theory and the1/N expansion.
