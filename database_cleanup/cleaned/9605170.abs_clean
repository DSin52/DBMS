We study gaugino condensation in the context of superstring effectivetheories using the linear multiplet formulation for the dilaton superfield.Including nonperturbative corrections to the K\"ahler potential for the dilatonmay naturally achieve dilaton stabilization, with supersymmetry breaking andgaugino condensation; these three issues are interrelated in a very simple way.In a toy model with a single static condensate, a dilaton $vev$ is found withina phenomenologically interesting range. The effective theory differssignificantly from condensate models studied previously in the chiralformulation.
