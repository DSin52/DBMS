Comments: LaTex, 9 pages, no figures, Invited talk at the 10 International

Conference Problems of Quantum Field Theory, Alushta (Cremea - Ukrain), May13-18, 1996We describe a model of massive matter fields interacting through higher-spingauge fields in 2+1 dimensional space-time. The two main conclusions are thatthe parameter of mass $M$ appears as a module characterizing an appropriatevacuum solution of the full non-linear model and that $M$ affects a structureof a global vacuum higher-spin symmetry which leaves invariant the chosenvacuum solution.
