The S-duality invariance of the equations of motion of four dimensionalstring effective action with cosmological constant, $\Lambda $, is studied. Itis demonstrated that the S-duality symmetry of the field equations are brokenfor nonzero $\Lambda$. The ``naturalness'' hypothesis is invoked to argue that$\Lambda $ should remain small since exact S-duality symmetry will force thecosmological constant to vanish in the string effective action.
