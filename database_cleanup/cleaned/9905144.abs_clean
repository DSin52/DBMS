We propose a method to obtain a manifestly supersymmetric action functionalfor interacting brane systems. It is based on the induced map of theworldvolume of low-dimensional branes into the worldvolume of the space-timefilling brane ((D-1)-brane), which may be either dynamical or auxiliary, andimplies an identification of Grassmann coordinate fields of lower dimensionalbranes with an image of the Grassmann coordinate fields of that (D-1)-brane.With this identification the covariant current distribution forms with supporton the superbrane worldvolumes become invariant under the target spacesupersymmetry and can be used to write the coupled superbrane action as anintegral over the D-dimensional manifolds ((D-1)-brane worldvolume). We comparethe equations derived from this new ('Goldstone fermion embedded') action withthe ones produced by a more straightforward generalization of the free braneactions based on the incorporation of the boundary terms with Lagrangemultipliers ('superspace embedded' action). We find that both proceduresproduce the same equations of motion and thus justify each other. Both actionsare presented explicitly for the coupled system of a D=10 super-D3-brane and afundamental superstring which ends on the super-D3-brane.
