A BIon may be defined as a finite energy solution of a non-linear fieldtheory with distributional sources. By contrast a soliton is usually defined tohave no sources. I show how harmonic coordinates map the exteriors of thetopologically and causally non-trivial spacetimes of extreme p-branes to BIonicsolutions of the Einstein equations in a topologically trivial spacetime inwhich the combined gravitational and matter energy momentum is located ondistributional sources. As a consequence the tension of BPS p-branes isclassically unrenormalized. The result holds equally for spacetimes withsingularities and for those, like the M-5-brane, which are everywheresingularity free.
