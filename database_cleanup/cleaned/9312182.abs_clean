We present a systematic approach to constructing current algebras based onnon-semi-simple groups. The Virasoro central charges corresponding to thesecurrent algebras are not, in general, given by integer numbers. The key pointin this construction is that the bilinear form appearing in the current algebracan be different from the bilinear form used to raise and lower group indices.The action which realises this current algebra as its symmetry is also found.
