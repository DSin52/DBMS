The one-loop effective action for general trajectories of D-particles inMatrix theory is calculated in the expansion with respect to the number ofderivatives up to six, which gives the equation of motion consistently. Theresult shows that the terms with six derivatives vanish for straight-linetrajectories, however, they do not vanish in general. This provides a concreteexample that non-renormalization of twelve-fermion terms does not necessarilyimply that of six-derivative terms.
