Title: The Coupling Constants and Masses of the Standard Model as Symmetry

NormalizationsComments: 20 pages, latex, macros included

The numerical input for the quantitative consequences of the electroweakstandard model, the hypercharge and isospin coupling constants and the Higgsfield ground state mass value, are interpreted as normalizations of thesymmetries involved. Using an additional statistical argument, a first orderquantitative determination of the Weinberg angle as a normalization ratio givesthe experimentally acceptable value $\tan^2\th={1\over3}$.
