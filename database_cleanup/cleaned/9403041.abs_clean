A WZW model for the non-semi-simple D-dimensional Heisenberg group, whichdirectly generalizes the E_{2}^{c} group, is constructed. It is found tocorrespond to an D-dimensional string background of plane-wave type withphysical Lorentz signature D-2. Perturbative and non-perturbativeconsiderations lead both to an integer central charge c=D.
