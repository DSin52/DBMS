We determine explicitly all structure constants of the whole chiral BRSTcohomology ring in $D=2$ string theory including both the discrete states andtachyon states. This is made possible by establishing several identities forSchur polynomials with operator argument and exploring associativity.Furthermore we find that the (chiral) symmetry algebra of the charges obtainedby using the descent equations can actually be read off from the cohomologyring structure by simple operation involving the ghost field $b$. We alsodetermine the enlarged symmetry algebra which contains the charges having ghostnumber $-1$ and $1$. Finally the complete symmetry transformation rules arederived for closed string discrete states by carefully combining the left andright sectors. It turns out that the new states introduced recently by Wittenand Zwiebach are naturally created when symmetries act on the old states.
