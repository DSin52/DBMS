Title: Higher order terms in the contraction of SO(3,2)

Authors: Walter Smilga

The contraction of a spin-1/2 representation of the de Sitter group SO(3,2)yields a translation operator that consists of the usual momentum operator plusa second order term, the "momentum spin" as described by F. Guersey. Thecontribution of momentum spin to the kinematics of a multiparticle system in atangential space of anti de Sitter space is analyzed. It is shown that it canbe described by a perturbation term with the structure of the interaction termof quantum electrodynamics. An evaluation of the corresponding couplingconstant reproduces Wyler's heuristic formula for the electromagnetic couplingconstant.
