A deformed Nahm equation for the BPS equation in the noncommutative N=4supersymmetric U(2) Yang-Mills theory is obtained. Using this, we constructedexplicitly a monopole solution of the noncommutative BPS equation to the linearorder of the noncommutativity scale. We found that the leading order correctionto the ordinary SU(2) monopole lies solely in the overall U(1) sector and thatthe overall U(1) magnetic field has an expected long range component ofmagnetic dipole moment.
