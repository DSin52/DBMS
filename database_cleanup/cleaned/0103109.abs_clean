In the semiclassical approximation of Grassmann-valued electric charges forregularizing Coulomb self-energies, we extract the uniqueacceleration-independent interaction hidden in any Lienard-Wiechert solutionfor the system of N positive-energy spinning particles plus the electromagneticfield in the radiation gauge of the rest-frame instant form. With the help of asemiclassical Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, this allows us to find therelativistic semiclassical Darwin potential. In the 2-body case thequantization of the lowest order reproduces exactly the results from thereduction of the Bethe-Salpeter equation.
