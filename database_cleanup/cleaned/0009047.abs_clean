We find solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity for M5-branes wrapped onRiemann surfaces. These solutions preserve ${\cal N} = 2$ four-dimensionalsupersymmetry. They are dual to ${\cal N} = 2$ gauge theories, includingnon-conformal field theories. We work out the case of ${\cal N} = 2$ Yang-Millsin detail.
