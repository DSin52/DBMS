We discuss the two-dimensional dilaton gravity with a scalar field as thesource matter where the coupling with the gravity is given, besides the minimalone, through an external field. This coupling generalizes the conformal anomalyin the same way as those found in recent literature, but with a diferentmotivation. The modification to the Hawking radiation is calculated explicityand shows an additional term that introduces a dependence on the (effective)mass of the black-hole.
