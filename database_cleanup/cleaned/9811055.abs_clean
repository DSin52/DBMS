approachAuthors: Federica Vian

Comments: 7 pages, 2 Figures, LaTeX. Talk given at the Workshop on the Exact

Renormalization Group, Faro (Portugal), 10-12 September 1998, to be publishedby World ScientificIn these notes the exact renormalization group formulation of the scalartheory is briefly reviewed. This regularization scheme is then applied tosupersymmetric theories. In case of a supersymmetric gauge theory it is alsoshown how to recover gauge invariance, broken by the introduction of theinfrared cutoff.
