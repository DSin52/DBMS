We consider the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method with a new R-matrixdepending on two parameters $q$ and $t$. We find that the underlying algebraicstructure is the two-parameter deformed algebra $SU_{q,t}(2)$ enlarged byintroducing an element belonging to the centre. The corresponding Hamiltoniandescribes the spin-1/2 XXZ model with twisted periodic boundary conditions.
