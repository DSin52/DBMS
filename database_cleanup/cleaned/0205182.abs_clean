We analyze the worldline formalism in the presence of a gravitationalbackground. In the worldline formalism a path integral is used to quantize theworldline coordinates of the particles. Contrary to the simpler cases of scalarand vector backgrounds, external gravity requires a precise definition of theultraviolet regularization of the path integral. Taking into account the UVregularization, we describe the first quantized representation of the one-loopeffective action for a scalar particle. We compute explicitly the contributionto the graviton tadpole and self-energy to test the validity of the method. Theresults obtained by usual field theoretical Feynman diagrams are reproduced inan efficient way. Finally, we comment on the technical problems related to thefactorization of the zero mode from the path integral on the circle.
