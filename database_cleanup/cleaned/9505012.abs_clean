We consider the topological gauged WZW model in the generalized momentumrepresentation. The chiral field $g$ is interpreted as a counterpart of theelectric field $E$ of conventional gauge theories. The gauge dependence of wavefunctionals $\Psi(g)$ is governed by a new gauge cocycle $\phi_{GWZW}$. Weevaluate this cocycle explicitly using the machinery of Poisson$\sigma$-models. In this approach the GWZW model is reformulated as a Schwarztype topological theory so that the action does not depend on the world-sheetmetric. The equivalence of this new formulation to the original one is provedfor genus one and conjectured for an arbitrary genus Riemann surface. As aby-product we discover a new way to explain the appearance of Quantum Groups inthe WZW model.
