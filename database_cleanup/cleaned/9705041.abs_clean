A first principles calculation of the quantum corrections to the electriccharge of a dyon in an N=2 gauge theory with arbitrary gauge group ispresented. These corrections arise from the fermion fields via the mechanism offermion fractionalization. For a dyon whose magnetic charge is a non-simpleco-root, the correction is a discontinuous function on the moduli space ofvacua and the discontinuities occur precisely on co-dimension one curves onwhich the dyon decays. In this way, the complete spectrum of dyons at weakcoupling is found for a theory with any gauge group. It is shown how thisspectrum is consistent with the semi-classical monodromies.
