We revise the problem of the quantization of relativistic particle,presenting a modified consistent canonical scheme, which allows one not only toinclude arbitrary backgrounds in the consideration but to get in course of thequantization a consistent relativistic quantum mechanics, which reproducesliterally the behavior of the one-particle sector of the corresponding quantumfield. At the same time this construction presents a possible solution of thewell-known old problem how to construct a consistent quantum mechanics on thebase of a relativistic wave equation.
