We study how the DGP (Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati) brane affects particledynamics in linearized approximation. We find that once the particle is removedfrom the brane it is repelled to the bulk. Assuming that the cutoff forgravitational interaction is $M_*\sim 1/\epsilon$, we calculate the classicalself energy of a particle as the function of its position. Since the particlewants to go to the region where its self energy is lower, it is repelled fromthe brane to the bulk where it gains its 5D self energy. Cases when mass of theparticle $m<8\pi^2M_*$ and $m>8\pi^2M_*$ are qualitatively different, and inlater case one has to take into account effects of strong gravity. In bothcases the particle is repelled from the brane. For $m<8\pi^2M_*$ we obtain thesame result from the 'electrostatic' analog of the theory. In that languagemass (charge) in the bulk induces charge distribution on the brane whichshields the other side of the brane and provides repulsive force. The DGP braneacts as a conducting plane in electrostatics (keeping in mind that in gravitydifferent charges repel). The repulsive nature of the brane requires a certainlocalization mechanism. When the particle overcomes the localizing potential itrapidly moves to the bulk. Particles of mass $m>8\pi^2M_*$ form a black holewithin $1/M_*$ distance from the brane.
