We examine string-theory orientifold planes of various types including the Spand SO-odd planes, and deduce the gravitational Chern-Simons couplings on theirworld-volumes. Consistency checks are carried out in different spacetimedimensions using various dualities, including those relating string theory withF-theory and M-theory. It is shown that when an orientifold 3-plane crosses a5-brane, the jump in the charge is accompanied by a corresponding change in thegravitational couplings.
