Following systematically the generalized Hamiltonian approach of Batalin,Fradkin and Tyutin, we embed the second-class non-abelian self-dual model of P.K. Townsend et al into a gauge theory. The strongly involutive Hamiltonian andconstraints are obtained as an infinite power series in the auxiliary fields.By formally summing the series we obtain a simple interpretation for thefirst-class Hamiltonian, constraints and observables.
