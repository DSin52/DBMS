The duality-type symmetries of string cosmology naturally lead to apre-big-bang phase of accelerated evolution as dual counterpart of thedecelerated expansion of standard cosmology. We discuss several properties ofthis scenario, including the possibility that tracks of the pre-big-bang may befound either in the spectrum of relic gravitons or in the distortion theyinduce on the cosmic microwave background.
