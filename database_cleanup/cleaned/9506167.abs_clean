Analytic Bethe ansatz is executed for a wide class of finite dimensional$U_q(B^{(1)}_r)$ modules. They are labeled by skew-Young diagrams which, ingeneral, contain a fragment corresponding to the spin representation. For thetransfer matrix spectra of the relevant vertex models, we establish a number offormulae, which are $U_q(B^{(1)}_r)$ analogues of the classical ones due toJacobi-Trudi and Giambelli on Schur functions. They yield a full solution tothe previously proposed functional relation ($T$-system), which is a Todaequation
