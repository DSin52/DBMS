We study the low-energy effective Lagrangian of $N=2$ heterotic string vacuaat the classical and quantum level. The couplings of the vector multiplets areuniquely determined at the tree level, while the loop corrections are severelyconstrained by the exact discrete symmetries of the string vacuum. We evaluatethe general transformation law of the perturbative prepotential and determineits form for the toroidal compactifications of six-dimensional $N=1$supersymmetric vacua.
