We construct spherical harmonics for fuzzy spheres of even and odddimensions, generalizing the correspondence between finite matrix algebras andfuzzy two-spheres.The finite matrix algebras associated with the various fuzzy spheres have anatural basis which falls in correspondence with tensor constructions ofirreducible representations of orthogonal groups SO(n). This basis is useful indescribing fluctuations around various D-brane constructions of fuzzy sphericalobjects. The higher fuzzy spheres are non-associative algebras that appear asprojections of associative algebras related to Matrices. The non-associativity(as well as the non-commutativity) disappears in the leading large $N$ limit,ensuring the correct classical limit. Some simple aspects of the combinatoricsof the fuzzy four-sphere can be accounted by a heuristic picture of giantfractional instantons.
