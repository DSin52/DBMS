A global extension of the Batalin-Marnelius proposal for a BRST inner productto gauge theories with topologically nontrivial gauge orbits is discussed. Itis shown that their (appropriately adapted) method is applicable to a largeclass of mechanical models with a semisimple gauge group in the adjoint andfundamental representation. This includes cases where the Faddeev-Popov methodfails. Simple models are found also, however, which do not allow for awell-defined global extension of the Batalin-Marnelius inner product due to aGribov obstruction. Reasons for the partial success and failure are worked outand possible ways to circumvent the problem are briefly discussed.
