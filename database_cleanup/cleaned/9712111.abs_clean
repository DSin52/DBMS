We consider the scaling limit of the two-dimensional $q$-state Potts modelfor $q\leq 4$. We use the exact scattering theory proposed by Chim andZamolodchikov to determine the one and two-kink form factors of the energy,order and disorder operators in the model. Correlation functions and universalcombinations of critical amplitudes are then computed within the two-kinkapproximation in the form factor approach. Very good agreement is foundwhenever comparison with exact results is possible. We finally consider thelimit $q\to 1$ which is related to the isotropic percolation problem. Althoughthis case presents a serious technical difficulty, we predict a value close to74 for the ratio of the mean cluster size amplitudes above and below thepercolation threshold. Previous estimates for this quantity range from 14 to220.
