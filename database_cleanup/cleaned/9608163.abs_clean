We study the correspondence between IIb solitonic 1-branes and monopoles inthe context of the 3-brane realization of $D=4$ $N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.We show that a bound state of 1-branes stretching between two separated3-branes exhibits a family of super-symmetric ground states that can beidentified with the ADHMN construction of the moduli space of $SU(2)$monopoles.. This identification is supported by the construction of themonopole gauge field as a space-time coupling in the quantum mechanicaleffective action of a 1-brane used as a probe. The analysis also reveals an1-branes in the ground states are described by non-commuting matrix valuedfields which develop poles at the boundary. Finally, the construction isgeneralized to $SU(n)$ monopoles with arbitrary $n>2$.
