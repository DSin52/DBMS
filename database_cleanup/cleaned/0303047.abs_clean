We study flux tubes on Higgs branches with curved geometry in supersymmetricgauge theories. As a first example we consider N=1 QED with one flavor ofcharges and with Higgs branch curved by adding a Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term. Weshow that in a generic vacuum on the Higgs branch flux tubes exist but become``thick''. Their internal structure in the plane orthogonal to the string isdetermined by ``BPS core'' formed by heavy fields and long range ``tail ''associated with light fields living on the Higgs branch. The string tension isgiven by the tension of ``BPS core'' plus contribution coming from the``tail''. Next we consider N=2 QCD with gauge group SU(2)and two flavors offundamental matter (quarks) with the same mass. We perturb this theory by themass term for the adjoint field which to the leading order in perturbationparameter do not break N=2 supersymmetry and reduces to FI term. The Higgsbranch has Eguchi-Hanson geometry. We work out string solution in the genericvacuum on the Higgs branch and calculate its string tension. We also discuss ifthese strings can turn into semilocal strings, the possibility related to theconfinement/deconfinement phase transition.
