Title: Nonlinear Electromagnetic Self-Duality and Legendre Transformations

Authors: Mary K. Gaillard and Bruno Zumino

Comments: 17 pages, full postscript available from

We discuss continuous duality transformations and the properties of classicaltheories with invariant interactions between electromagnetic fields and matter.The case of scalar fields is treated in some detail. Special discrete elementsof the continuous group are shown to be related to the Legendre transformationwith respect to the field strengths.
