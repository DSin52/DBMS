We show that recently formulated four-dimensional self-dual supersymmetricYang-Mills theory, which is consistent background for open $~N=2$~ superstring,generates two-dimensional $~N=(1,1),~\, N=(1,0) $~ and $~N=(2,0)$~supersymmetric gauged Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten $~\s\-$models on cosetmanifolds $~G/H$, after appropriate dimensional reductions. This is supportingevidence for the conjecture that the self-dual supersymmetric Yang-Mills theorywill generate lower-dimensional supersymmetric integrable models afterdimensional reductions.
