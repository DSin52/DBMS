Title: The Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for quadratic algebras of Koszul type

Authors: Alexander Braverman and Dennis Gaitsgory

Comments: 11 pages, TeX

In this paper we discuss a generalization of the classica PBW-theorem to thecase of Koszul algebras. Our result is a slight generalization of that obtainedby A.Polischuk and L.Positselsky, but the proof is different and usesdeformation theory.
