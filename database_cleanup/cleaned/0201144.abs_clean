The IR/UV mixing and the violation of unitarity are two of the mostintriguing aspects of noncommutative quantum field theories. In this paper therelation between these two phenomena is explained and established. We start outby showing that the S-matrix of noncommutative field theories is hermitiananalytic. As a consequence, a noncommutative field theory is unitary if thediscontinuities of its Feynman diagram amplitudes agree with the expressionscalculated using the Cutkosky formulae. These unitarity constraints relate thediscontinuities of amplitudes with physical intermediate states; and allow usto see how the IR/UV mixing may lead to a breakdown of unitarity. Specifically,we show that the IR/UV singularity does not lead to the violation of unitarityin the space-space noncommutative case, but it does lead to its violation in aspace-time noncommutative field theory. As a corollary, noncommutative fieldtheory without IR/UV mixing will be unitary in both the space-space andspace-time noncommutative case. To illustrate this, we introduce and analysethe noncommutative Lee model--an exactly solvable quantum field theory. We showthat the model is free from the IR/UV mixing in both the space-space andspace-time noncommutative cases. Our analysis is exact. Due to absence of theIR/UV mixing one can expect that the theory is unitary. We present some checkssupporting this claim. Our analysis provides a counter example to the generallyheld beliefs that field theories with space-time noncommutativity arenon-unitary.
