We analyze the scalar field sector of the Kazakov--Migdal model of inducedQCD. We present a detailed description of the simplest one dimensional{($d$$=$$1$)} model which supports the hypothesis of wide applicability of themean--field approximation for the scalar fields and the existence of criticalbehaviour in the model when the scalar action is Gaussian. Despite theocurrence of various non--trivial types of critical behaviour in the $d=1$model as $N\rightarrow\infty$, only the conventional large-$N$ limit isrelevant for its {\it continuum} limit. We also give a mean--field analysis ofthe $N=2$ model in {\it any} $d$ and show that a saddle point always exists inthe region $m^2>m_{\rm crit}^2(=d)$. In $d=1$ it exhibits critical behaviour as$m^2\rightarrow m_{\rm crit}^2$. However when $d$$>$$1$ there is no criticalbehaviour unless non--Gaussian terms are added to the scalar field action. Weargue that similar behaviour should occur for any finite $N$ thus providing asimple explanation of a recent result of D. Gross. We show that criticalbehaviour at $d$$>$$1$ and $m^2>m^2_{\rm crit}$ can be obtained by adding a$logarithmic$ term to the scalar potential. This is equivalent to a localmodification of the integration measure in the original Kazakov--Migdal model.Experience from previous studies of the Generalized Kontsevich Model impliesthat, unlike the inclusion of higher powers in the potential, this minormodification should not substantially alter the behaviour of the Gaussianmodel.
