Title: On Lie point symmetry of classical Wess-Zumino-Witten model

Authors: Karmadeva Maharana

Comments: LateX, 9 pages

We perform the group analysis of Witten's equations of motion for a particlemoving in the presence of a magnetic monopole, and also when constrained tomove on the surface of a sphere, which is the classical Wess-Zumino-Wittenmodel. We also consider variations of this model. Our analysis gives thegenerators of the corresponding Lie point symmetries. The Lie symmetrycorresponding to Kepler's third law is obtained in two related examples.
