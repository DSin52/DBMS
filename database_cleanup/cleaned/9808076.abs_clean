Title: Manifestly covariant action for symmetric Chern-Simons field theory

Authors: Won Tae Kim and Myung Seok Yoon

Comments: 19 pages, revtex, one paragraph is replaced with other issue and

physical application is exhibitedWe study a three-dimensional symmetric Chern-Simons field theory with ageneral covariance and it turns out that the original Chern-Simons theory isjust a gauge fixed action of the symmetric Chern-Simons theory whose constraintalgebra belongs to fully first class constraint system. The AbelianChern-Simons theory with matter coupling is studied for the construction ofanyon operators without any ordering ambiguity with the help of this symmetricChern-Simons action. Finally we shall discuss some connections between thepresent symmetric formulation of Chern-Simons theory and the St\"ukelbergmechanism.
