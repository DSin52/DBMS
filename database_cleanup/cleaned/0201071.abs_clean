It is shown that the notion of W_\infty-algebra originally carried out over a(compact) Riemann surface can be extended to n complex dimensional (compact)manifolds within a symplectic geometrical setup. The relationships with theKodaira-Spencer deformation theory of complex structures are discussed.Subsequently, some field theoretical aspects at the classical level are brieflyunderlined.
