We propose a description of open string fields on a D25-brane in vacuumstring field theory. We show that the tachyon mass is correctly reproduced fromour proposal and further argue that the mass spectrum of all other open stringstates is correctly obtained as well. We identify the string coupling constantfrom the three-tachyon coupling and show that the tension of a D25-brane iscorrectly expressed in terms of the coupling constant, which resolves thecontroversy in the literature. We also discuss a reformulation of ourdescription which is rather similar to boundary string field theory.
