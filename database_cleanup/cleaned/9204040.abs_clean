We describe the duality group $\Gamma=SU(3,3,Z)$ for the Narain lattice ofthe $T^6/Z_3$ orbifold and its action on the corresponding moduli space. Asymplectic embedding of the momenta and winding numbers allows us to connectthe orbifold lattice to the special geometry of the moduli space. As anapplication, a formal expression for an automorphic function, which is acandidate for a non--perturbative superpotential, is given.
