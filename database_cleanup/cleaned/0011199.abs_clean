We present the results of a numerical investigation of percolation propertiesin a version of the classical Heisenberg model. In particular we study thepercolation properties of the subsets of the lattice corresponding toequatorial strips of the target manifold ${\cal S}^2$. As shown by us severalyears ago, this is relevant for the existence of a massless phase of the model.Our investigation yields strong evidence that such a massless phase does indeedexist. It is further shown that this result implies lack of asymptotic freedomin the massive continuum limit. A heuristic estimate of the transitiontemperature is given which is consistent with the numerical data.
