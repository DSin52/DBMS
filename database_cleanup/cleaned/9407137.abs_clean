A Higgsless model for strong, electro-weak and gravitational interactions isproposed. This model is based on the local symmetry group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)xCwhere C is the local conformal symmetry group. The natural minimal conformallyinvariant form of total lagrangian is postulated. It contains all StandardModel fields and gravitational interaction. Using the unitary gauge and theconformal scale fixing conditions we can eliminate all four real components ofthe Higgs doublet in this model. However the masses of vector mesons, leptonsand quarks are automatically generated and are given by the same formulas as inthe conventional Standard Model. The gravitational sector is analyzed and it isshown that the model admits in the classical limit the Einsteinian form ofgravitational interactions. No figures.
