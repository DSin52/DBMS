The critical exponent corresponding to the renormalization of the compositeoperator $\bar{\psi}\psi$ is computed in quantum electrodynamics at$O(1/\Nf^2)$ in arbitrary dimensions and covariant gauge at the non-trivialzero of the $\beta$-function in the large $\Nf$ expansion and the exponentcorresponding to the anomalous dimension of the electron mass which is a gaugeindependent object is deduced. Expanding in powers of $\epsilon$ $=$ $2$ $-$$d/2$ we check it is consistent with the known three loop perturbativestructure and determine the subsequent coefficients in the coupling constant
