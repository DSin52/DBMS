Brane gas cosmology is a scenario inspired by string theory which proposes asimple resolution to the initial singularity problem and gives a dynamicalexplanation for the number of spatial dimensions of our universe. In this workwe have studied analytically and numerically the late-time behaviour of thesetype of cosmologies taking a proper care of the annihilation of winding modes.This has help us to clarify and extend several aspects of their dynamics. Wehave found that the decay of winding states into non-winding states behavinglike a gas of ordinary non-relativistic particles precludes the existence of alate expansion phase of the universe and obstructs the growth of three largespatial dimensions as we observe today. We propose a generic solution to thisproblem by considering the dynamics of a gas of non-static branes. We have alsoobtained a simple criterion on the initial conditions to ensure the smallstring coupling approximation along the whole dynamical evolution, andconsequently, the consistency of an effective low-energy description. Finally,we have reexamined the general conditions for a loitering period in theevolution of the universe which could serve as a mechanism to resolve the {\slbrane problem} - a problem equivalent to the {\sl domain wall problem} instandard cosmology - and discussed the scaling properties of a self-interactingnetwork of winding modes taking into account the effects of the dilatondynamics.
