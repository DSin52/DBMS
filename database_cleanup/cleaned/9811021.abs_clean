The massive IIA string theory whose low energy limit is the massivesupergravity theory constructed by Romans is obtained from M-theorycompactified on a 2-torus bundle over a circle in a limit in which the volumeof the bundle shrinks to zero. The massive string theories in 9-dimensionsgiven by Scherk-Schwarz reduction of IIB string theory are interpreted asF-theory compactified on 2-torus bundles over a circle. The M-theory solutionthat gives rise to the D8-brane of the massive IIA theory is identified.Generalisations of Scherk-Schwarz reduction are discussed.
