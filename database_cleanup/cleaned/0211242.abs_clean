Title: The Master Ward Identity and Generalized Schwinger-Dyson Equation in

Classical Field TheoryAuthors: Michael Duetsch, Klaus Fredenhagen

Comments: 56 pages

In the framework of perturbative quantum field theory a new, universalrenormalization condition (called Master Ward Identity) was recently proposedby one of us (M.D.) in a joint paper with F.-M. Boas. The main aim of thepresent paper is to get a better understanding of the Master Ward Identity byanalyzing its meaning in classical field theory. It turns out that it is themost general identity for classical local fields which follows from the fieldequations. It is equivalent to a generalization of the Schwinger-Dyson Equationand is closely related to the Quantum Action Principle of Lowenstein and Lam.The validity of the Master Ward Identity makes possible a local constructionof quantum gauge theories.As a byproduct we complete Peierls' manifestly covariant definition of thePoisson bracket.
