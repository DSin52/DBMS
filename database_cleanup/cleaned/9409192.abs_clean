We study algebras with a distributive law and the Koszulness of associatedoperads. As a corollary of our theory we prove that the homology operad of thelittle cubes operad is Koszul, the result which was originally proven by E.Getzler and J.D.S. Jones in their preprint "Operads, homotopy algebra, anditerated integrals for double loop spaces" using the combinatorics of thestratification of the Fulton-MacPherson compactification of the configurationspace. Since the above mentioned result whose purely algebraic proof we giveplays and important role in closed string field theory and especially themethods used in the original proof of Getzler and Jones are very relevant forthis part of mathematical physics, we decided to put our paper here, thoughsome 80% of its material belongs rather to universal and homological algebra.
