We present a simple unifying gauge theoretical formulation of gravitationaltheories in two dimensional spacetime. This formulation includes the effects ofa novel matter-gravity coupling which leads to an extended de Sitter symmetryalgebra on which the gauge theory is based. Contractions of this theoryencompass previously studied cases.
