If string theory controls physics at the string scale, the dynamics of theearly universe before the GUT era will be governed by the low-energy stringequations of motion. Studying these equations for FRW spacetimes, we find thatdepending on the initial conditions when the stringy era starts, and on thetime when it ends, there are a wide variety of qualitatively distinct types ofevolution. We classify these, and present the general solution to the equationsof motion.
