Light-Front (LF) Hamiltonian for QED in (1+1)-dimensions is constructed usingthe boson form of this model with additional Pauli-Villars type ultravioletregularization. Perturbation theory, generated by this LF Hamiltonian, isproved to be equivalent to usual covariant chiral perturbation theory. Theobtained LF Hamiltonian depends explicitly on chiral condensate parameterswhich enter in a form of some coupling constants.
