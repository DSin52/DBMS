In this paper it is shown how the generating functional for Green's functionsin relativistic quantum field theory and in thermal field theory can beevaluated in terms of a standard quantum mechanical path integral. With thiscalculational approach one avoids the loop-momentum integrals usuallyencountered in Feynman perturbation theory, although with thermal Green'sfunctions, a discrete sum (over the winding numbers of paths with respect tothe circular imaginary time) must be computed. The high-temperature expansionof this sum can be performed for all Green's functions at the same time, and isparticularly simple for the static case. The procedure is illustrated byevaluating the two-point function to one-loop order in a $\phi^3_6$ model.
