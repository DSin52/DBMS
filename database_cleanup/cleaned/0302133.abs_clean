Title: Particle Spectrum of the Supersymmetric Standard Model from the Massless

Excitations of a Four Dimensional SuperstringAuthors: B. B. Deo and L. Maharana

A superstring action is quantised with Neveu Schwarz(NS) and Ramond(R)boundary conditions. The zero mass states of the NS sector are classified asthe vector gluons, W-mesons, $B_{\mu}$-mesons and scalars containing Higgs. Thefifteen zero mass fermions are obtained from the Ramond sector. A space timesupersymmetric Hamiltonian of the Standard Model is presented without anyconventional SUSY particles.
