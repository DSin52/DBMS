The one-loop partition function for a charged self-interacting Bose gas atfinite temperature in D-dimensional spacetime is evaluated within a pathintegral approach making use of zeta-function regularization. For D even, a newadditional vacuum term ---overlooked in all previous treatments and coming fromthe multiplicative anomaly related to functional determinants-- is found andits dependence on the mass and chemical potential is obtained. The presence ofthe new term is shown to be crucial for having the factorization invariance ofthe regularized partition function. In the non interacting case, therelativistic Bose-Einstein condensation is revisited. By means of a suitablecharge renormalization, for D=4 the symmetry breaking phase is shown to beunaffected by the new term, which, however, gives actually rise to a nonvanishing new contribution in the unbroken phase.
