The work proposes a geometric background of the theory of field interactionsand strings in spaces with higher order anisotropy. Our approach proceeds bydeveloping the concept of higher order anisotropic superspace which unifies thelogical and mathematical aspects of modern Kaluza-Klein theories andgeneralized Lagrange and Finsler geometry and leads to modelling of physicalprocesses on higher order fiber bundles provided with nonlinear anddistingushed connections and metric structures. The view adopted is that ageneral field theory should incorporate all possible anisotropic and stochasticmanifestations of classical and quantum interactions and, in consequence, acorresponding modification of basic principles and mathematical methods informulation of physical theories. The presentation is divided into two parts.The first five sections cover the higher order anisotropic superspaces. Wefocus on the geometry of distinguished by nonlinear connection vectorsuperbundles, consider different supersymmetric extensions of Finsler andLagrange spaces and analyze the structure of basic geometric objects on suchsuperspaces. The remaining five sections are devoted to the theory of higherorder anisotropic superstrings. In the framework of supersymmetric nonlinearsigma models in Finser extended backgrounds we prove that the low-energydynamics of such strings contains motion equations for locally anisotropicfield interactions.
