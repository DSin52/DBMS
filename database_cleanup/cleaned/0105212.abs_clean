Authors: Justin Khoury, Burt A. Ovrut, Paul J. Steinhardt and Neil Turok

Comments: 4 pages

We respond to the criticisms by Kallosh, Kofman and Linde concerning ourproposal of the ekpyrotic universe scenario. We point out a number of errors intheir considerations and argue that, at this stage, the ekpyrotic model is apossible alternative to inflationary cosmology as a description of the veryearly universe.
