We construct an approximate solution of field equations in the Abelian Higgsmodel which describes motion of a curved vortex. The solution is found to thefirst order in the inverse mass of the Higgs field with the help of theHilbert-Chapman-Enskog method. Consistency conditions for the approximatesolution are obtained with the help of a classical Ward identity. We find thatthe Higgs field of the curved vortex of the topological charge $n \geq 2$ inthe (n-1)-th order and it follows a Nambu-Goto type trajectory, the other oneis of the first order and its trajectory in general is not of the Nambu-Gototype. For $|n|=1$ the single zero in general does not lie on Nambu-Goto typetrajectory.
