One and two loop self-energies are worked out explicitly for a heavy scalarfield interacting weakly with a light self-interacting scalar field at finitetemperature. The ring/daisy diagrams and a set of necklace diagrams can besummed simultaneously. This simple model serves to illustrate the connectionbetween multi-loop self-energy diagrams and multiple scattering in a medium.
