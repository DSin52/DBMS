We investigate $N=2$ extended superconformal symmetry, using the half-twistedLandau-Ginzburg models. The first example is the $D_{2n+2}$ -type minimalmodel. It has been conjectured that this model has a spin $n$ super $W$current. We checked this by the direct computations of the BRS cohomology classup to $n=4$. We observe for $n\le 3$ the super W currents generate the ringisomorphic to the chiral ring of the model with respect to the classicalproduct. We thus conjecture that this isomorphism holds for any $n$. The nextexample is $ CP_{n}$ coset model. In this case we find a sort of Miuratransformation which gives the simple formula for the super W currents of spin\{1,2,...,n\} in terms of the chiral superfields. Explicit form of the super Wcurrents and their Poisson brackets are obtained for $CP_{2},CP_{3}$ case. Wealso conjecture that as long as the classical product is concerned, these superW currents generate the ring isomorphic to the chiral ring of the model andthis is checked for $CP_2$ model.
