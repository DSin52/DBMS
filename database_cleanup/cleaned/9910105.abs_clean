Strominger has derived the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the BTZ black holeusing asymptotic Virasoro algebra. We apply Strominger's method to a black holesolution found by Martinez and Zanelli (MZ). This is a solution ofthree-dimensional gravity with a conformal scalar field. The solution is not$AdS_3$, but it is asymptotically $AdS_3$; therefore, it has the asymptoticVirasoro algebra. We compute the central charge for the theory and comparesCardy's formula with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. It turns out that thefunctional form does agree, but the overall numerical coefficient does not.This is because this approach gives the "maximum possible entropy" for thenumerical coefficient.
