Starting from the new minimal multiplet of supergravity in $2+2$ dimensions,we construct two types of self-dual supergravity theories. One of them involvesa self-duality condition on the Riemann curvature and implies the equations ofmotion following from the Hilbert-Einstein type supergravity action. The otherone involves a self-duality condition on a {\it torsionful} Riemann curvaturewith the torsion given by the field-strength of an antisymmetric tensor field,and implies the equations of motion that follow from an $R^2$-type action.
