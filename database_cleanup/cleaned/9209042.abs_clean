Thus far in the search for, and classification of, `physical' modularinvariant partition functions $\sum N_{LR}\,\c_L\,\C_R$ the attention has beenfocused on the {\it symmetric} case where the holomorphic and anti-holomorphicsectors, and hence the characters $\c_L$ and $\c_R$, are associated with thesame Kac-Moody algebras $\g_L=\g_R$ and levels $k_L=k_R$. In this paper weconsider the more general possibility where $(\g_L,k_L)$ may not equal$(\g_R,k_R)$. We discuss which choices of algebras and levels may correspond towell-defined conformal field theories, we find the `smallest' such {\itheterotic} (\ie asymmetric) partition functions, and we give a method,generalizing the Roberts-Terao-Warner lattice method, for explicitlyconstructing many other modular invariants. We conclude the paper by provingthat this new lattice method will succeed in generating all the heteroticpartition functions, for all choices of algebras and levels.
