We advocate a framework for constructing perturbative closed stringcompactifications which do not have large-radius limits. The idea is to augmentthe class of vacua which can be described as fibrations by enlarging themonodromy group around the singular fibers to include perturbative stringyduality symmetries. As a controlled laboratory for testing this program, westudy in detail six-dimensional (1,0) supersymmetric vacua arising fromtwo-torus fibrations over a two-dimensional base. We also construct someexamples of two-torus fibrations over four-dimensional bases, and comment onthe extension to other fibrations.
