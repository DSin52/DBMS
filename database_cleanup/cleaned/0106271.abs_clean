Cosmological brane world solutions are found for five-dimensional bulkspacetimes with a scalar field. A supergravity inspired method for obtainingstatic solutions is combined with a method for finding brane cosmologies withconstant bulk energies. This provides a way to generate full (bulk and brane)cosmological solutions to brane worlds with bulk scalar fields. Examples ofthese solutions, and their cosmological evolution, are discussed.
