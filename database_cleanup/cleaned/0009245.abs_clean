Rim. 7 pages, JHEP styleThe reflection amplitudes in non-affine Toda theories which possess extendedconformal symmetry are calculated. Considering affine Toda theories asperturbed non-affine Toda theories and using reflection relations which relatedifferent fields with the same conformal dimension, we deduce the vacuumexpectation values of local fields for all dual pairs of non-simply lacedaffine Toda field theories. As an application, we calculate the leading term inthe short and long distance predictions of the two-point correlation functionsin the massive phase of two coupled minimal models. The central charge of theunperturbed models ranges from $c=1$ to $c=2$, where the perturbed modelscorrespond to two magnetically coupled Ising models and Heisenberg spinladders, respectively.
