Comments: 154 pages,latex, 17 figures (not included,hard copy available on

request)Various aspects of the theory of quantum integrable systems are reviewed.Basic ideas behind the construction of integrable ultralocal and nonultralocalquantum models are explored by exploiting the underlying algebraic structuresrelated to the Yang-Baxter equations. Physical meaning of abstractmathematical notions like universal R-matrix, quantized algebras,Sklyanin algebra, braided algebra, Hopf algebra etc. and the role played bythem in integrable systems are highlighted. Systematic construction of quantumintegrable lattice as well as field models and their exact excitation spectraare presented through examples. The coordinate and algebraic formulations ofthe Bethe ansatz are illustrated with comparison, along with the description ofnested and functional Bethe ansatzes. The techniques for deriving quantumHamiltonians from the Lax operators are demonstrated on concrete models. Theexposition of this review is kept in a fairly elementary level with emphasis onthe physical contents.
