These pedagogical lectures present some material, classical or more recent,on (Rational) Conformal Field Theories and their general setting ``in thebulk'' or in the presence of a boundary. Two well posed problems are theclassification of modular invariant partition functions and the determinationof boundary conditions consistent with conformal invariance. It is shown whythe two problems are intimately connected and how graphs -ADE Dynkin diagramsand their generalizations- appear in a natural way.
