correctionsFollowing the new gauging fixing method of D'Hoker and Phong, we studytwo-loop superstrings in hyperelliptic language. By using hyperellipticrepresentation of genus 2 Riemann surface we derive a set of identitiesinvolving the Szeg\"o kernel. These identities are used to prove the vanishingof the cosmological constant and the non-renormalization theorem point-wise inmoduli space by doing the summation over all the 10 even spin structures.Modular invariance is maintained at every stage of the computation explicitly.The 4-particle amplitude is also computed and an explicit expression for thechiral integrand is obtained. We use this result to show that the perturbativecorrection to the $R^4$ term in type II superstring theories is vanishing attwo loops.In this paper, a summary of the main results is presented with detailedderivations to be provided in two subsequent publications.
