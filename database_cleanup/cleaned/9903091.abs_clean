We consider SO(4) x SO(6) invariant type IIB string solution describingD3-branes superposed with D-instantons homogeneously distributed over D3-braneworld-volume. In the near D3-brane horizon limit this background interpolatesbetween AdS_5 x S^5 space in UV and flat space (with non-constant dilaton andRR scalar) in IR. Generalizing the AdS/CFT conjecture we suggest that type IIBstring in this geometry is dual to N=4 SYM theory in a state with a constantself-dual gauge field background. The semiclassical string representation forthe Wilson factor implies confinement with effective string tension dependingon constant D-instanton density parameter. This provides a simple example oftype IIB string -- gauge theory duality with clear D-brane and gauge theoryinterpretation.
