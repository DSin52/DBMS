Title: Black Hole Thermodynamics, Induced Gravity and Gravity in Brane Worlds

Comments: 9 pages, minor changes in the text, reference added

One of explanations of the black hole entropy implies that gravity isentirely induced by quantum effects. By using arguments based on the AdS/CFTcorrespondence we give induced gravity interpretation of the gravity in a braneworld in higher dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. The underlying quantumtheory is SU(N) theory where $N$ is related to the CFT central charge. Thetheory includes massless fields which correspond to degrees of freedom of theboundary CFT. In addition, on the brane there are massive degrees of freedomwith masses proportional to $l^{-1}$ where $l$ is the radius of AdS. At theconformal boundary of AdS they are infinitely heavy and completely decouple. Itis the massive fields which can explain the black hole entropy. We support ourinterpretation by a microscopic model of a 2D brane world in $AdS_3$.
