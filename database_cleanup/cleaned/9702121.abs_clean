Title: The five exceptional simple Lie superalgebras of vector fields

Comments: LeTeX, 23 pages

The five simple exceptional complex Lie superalgbras of vector fields aredescribed. One of them is new; the other four are explicitely described for thefirst time. All of the exceptional Lie superalgebras are obtained with the helpof the Cartan prolongation or a generalized prolongation.The description of several of the exceptional Lie superalgebras is associatedwith the Lie superalgebra AS - the nontrivial central extension of thesupertraceless subalgebra SPE(4) of the periplectic Lie superalgebra PE(4) thatpreserves the nondegenerate odd bilinear form on the (4|4)-dimensionalsuperspace. (A nontrivial central extension of SPE(n) only exists for n=4.)
