Title: New $AdS_3$ Branes and Boundary States

Authors: Arvind Rajaraman

Comments: 18 pages, latex

We examine D-branes on $AdS_3$, and find a three-brane wrapping the entire$AdS_3$, in addition to 1-branes and instantonic 2-branes previously discussedin the literature. The three-brane is found using a construction of Maldacena,Moore, and Seiberg. We show that all these branes satisfy Cardy's condition andextract the open string spectrum on them.
