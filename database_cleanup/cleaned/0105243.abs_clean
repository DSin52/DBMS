We argue that any viable mechanism of gauge field localization shouldautomatically imply charge universality on the brane. We study whether thiscondition is satisfied in the two known proposals aimed to localize vectorfield in flat bulk space. We construct a simple calculable model withconfinement in the bulk and deconfinement on the brane, as in theShifman--Dvali set up. We find that in our model the 4-dimensional Coulomb lawis indeed reproduced on the brane due to the massless localized photon mode.The charge universality is enforced by the presence of ``confining strings''.On the other hand, charge universality condition is not satisfied in another,brane-induced localization mechanism when the number of extra dimensions d islarger than two. We demonstrate that in the non-Abelian case the gauge fieldsinside the brane are never four-dimensional and their self-interaction isstrong at all distances of interest. Hence this mechanism does not work ford>2. At d=2 the charge universality is still a problem, but it holdsautomatically at d=1. At d=1, however, the bulk gauge fields are stronglycoupled in the non-Abelian case.
