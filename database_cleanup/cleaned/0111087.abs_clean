We study the star algebra of ghost sector in vacuum string field theory(VSFT). We show that the star product of two states in the Siegel gauge is BRSTexact if we take the BRST charge to be the one found in hep-th/0108150, and theBRST exact states are nil factors in the star algebra. By introducing a newstar product defined on the states in the Siegel gauge, the equation of motionof VSFT is characterized as the projection condition with respect to this newproduct. We also comment on the comma form of string vertex in the ghostsector.
