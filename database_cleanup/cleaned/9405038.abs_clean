We derive explicit integral formulas for eigenfunctions of quantum integralsof the Calogero-Sutherland-Moser operator with trigonometric interactionpotential. In particular, we derive explicit formulas for Jack's symmetricfunctions. To obtain such formulas, we use the representation of theseeigenfunctions by means of traces of intertwining operators between certainmodules over the Lie algebra $\frak gl_n$, and the realization of these moduleson functions of many variables.
