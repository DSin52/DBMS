AdS2 has an SL(2,R) isometry group. It is argued that in the context ofquantum gravity on AdS2 this group is enlarged to the full infinite-dimensional1+1 conformal group. Massive scalar fields are coupled to AdS2 gravity andshown to have associated conformal weights h(m) shifted by their mass. Forintegral values of h primary boundary operators are obtained as h normalderivatives of the scalar field. AdS2 string theories arise in the`very-near-horizon' limit of S1-compactified AdS3 string theories. This limitcorresponds to energies far below the compactification scale. The dualconformal field theory has one null dimension and can in certain cases bedescribed as the discrete light cone quantization of a two-dimensional deformedsymmetric-product conformal field theory. Evidence is given that the AdS2Virasoro algebra is related to the right-moving AdS3 Virasoro algebra by atopological twist which shifts the central charge to zero.
