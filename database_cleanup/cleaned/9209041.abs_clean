In the context of hermitean one--matrix models we show that the emergence ofthe NLS hierarchy and of its reduction, the KdV hierarchy, is an exact resultof the lattice characterizing the matrix model. Said otherwise, we are notobliged to take a continuum limit to find these hierarchies. We interpret thisresult as an indication of the topological nature of them. We discuss thetopological field theories associated with both and discuss the connection withtopological field theories coupled to topological gravity already studied inthe literature.
