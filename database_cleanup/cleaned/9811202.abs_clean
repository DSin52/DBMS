Quantum mechanics on manifolds is not unique and in general infinite numberof inequivalent quantizations can be considered. They are specified by theinduced spin and the induced gauge structures on the manifold. Theconfiguration space of collective mode in the Skyrme model can be identifiedwith $S^{3}$ and thus the quantization is not unique. This leads to thedifferent predictions for the physical observables.
