We investigate the SU(N) Principal Chiral Model on a half-line with aparticular set of boundary conditions (BCs). In previous work these BCs havebeen shown to correspond to boundary scattering matrices (K-matrices) which arerepresentation conjugating and whose matrix structure corresponds to one of thesymmetric spaces SU(N)/SO(N) or SU(N)/Sp(N). Starting from the bulk particlespectrum and the K-matrix for a particle in the vector representation weconstruct K-matrices for particles in higher rank representations scatteringoff the boundary. We then perform an analysis of the physical strip polestructure and provide a complete set of boundary Coleman-Thun mechanisms forthose poles which do not correspond to particles coupling to the boundary. Wefind that the model has no non-trivial boundary states.
