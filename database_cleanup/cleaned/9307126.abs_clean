KUL-TF-93/32We summarize the application of the field--antifield formalism to thequantization of gauge field theories. After the gauge fixing, the main issuesare the regularization and anomalies. We illustrate this for chiral $W_3$gravity. We discuss also gauge theories with a non-local action, induced by amatter system with an anomaly. As an illustration we use induced WZW models,including a discussion of non--local regularization, the importance of themeasure and regularization of multiple loops. In these theories antifieldsbecome propagating --- one of many roles assigned to them in the BV formalism.
