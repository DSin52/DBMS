The encoding of an inflating patch of space-time in terms of a dual theory isdiscussed. Following Bousso's interpretation of the holographic principle, wefind that those are generically described not by states in the dual theory butby density matrices. We try to implement this idea on simple deformations ofthe AdS/CFT examples, and an argument is given as to why inflation is soelusive to string theory.
