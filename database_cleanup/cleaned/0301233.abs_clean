By using the systematic approach of parent action method, we derive thePolyakov and two Weyl-invariant actions of bosonic p-branes ($p \geq 2$)starting from the Nambu-Goto action, and establish the duality symmetries inthis set of four actions. Moreover, we discover a new bosonic p-brane action(including the string theory) and deduce two corresponding Weyl-invariantformulations by proposing a new special parent action. We find that the sameduality symmetries as those mentioned above exist in this new set of actions.The new p-brane actions are also briefly analyzed.
