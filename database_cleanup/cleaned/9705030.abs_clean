We discuss consistency conditions for branes at orbifold singularities. Theconditions have a world-sheet interpretation in terms of tadpole cancellationand a space-time interpretation in terms of anomalies. As examples, we considertype II and type I branes on $C^2/Z_M$ orbifolds. We give orientifoldconstructions of phases of type I or heterotic string theory, involvingbranches with extra tensor multiplets, which arise when small SO(32) instantonssit on orbifold singularities.
