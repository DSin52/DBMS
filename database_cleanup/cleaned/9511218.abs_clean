We probe the geometry around an elementary BPS (EBPS) state in heteroticstring theory compactified on a six-torus by scattering a massless scalar offit and comparing with the corresponding experiment in which the EBPS state isreplaced by a classical extremal black hole background satisfying the BPScondition. We find that the low energy limit of the scattering amplitudesprecisely agree if one takes the limit $m_{\rm bh} >> m_P$. In the classicalexperiment, beyond a certain frequency of the incident wave, part of the waveis found to be absorbed by the black hole, whereas in case of the stringscattering there is a critical frequency (inelastic threshold) of the probebeyond which the EBPS state gets excited to a higher mass non-BPS elementarystate. The classical absorption threshold matches exactly with the inelasticthreshold in the limit of maximum degeneracy of the EBPS state of a given mass.In that limit we can therefore identify absorption by the black hole asexcitation of the elementary string state to the next vibrational state of thestring and consequently also identify the non-BPS string state as anon-extremal black hole.
