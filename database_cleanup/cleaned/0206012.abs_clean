Title: D-geometric Structure of Orbifolds

Authors: Tomomi Muto

Comments: 17 pages, 10 figures

We study D-branes on abelian orbifolds C^d/Z_N for d=2, 3. The toric datadescribing the D-brane vacuum moduli space, which represents the geometryprobed by D-branes, has certain redundancy compared with the classicalgeometric description of the orbifolds. We show that the redundancy has asimple combinatorial structure and find analytic expressions for degrees of theredundancy. For d=2 the structure of the redundancy has a connection withrepresentations of SU(N) Lie algebra, which provides a new correspondencebetween geometry and representation theory. We also prove that non-geometricphases do not appear in the Kahler moduli space for d=2.
