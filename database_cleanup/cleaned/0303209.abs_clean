We find the effective action for any D-brane in a general bosonic backgroundof supergravity. The results are explicit in component fields up to secondorder in the fermions and are obtained in a covariant manner. No interactionterms between fermions and the field $f=b+F$, characteristic of the bosonicactions, are considered. These are reserved for future work. In order to obtainthe actions, we reduce directly from the M2-brane world-volume action to theD2-brane world-volume action. Then, by means of T-duality, we obtain the otherDp-brane actions. The resulting Dp-brane actions can be written in a singlecompact and elegant expression.
