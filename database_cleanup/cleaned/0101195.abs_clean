We propose a systematic way of constructing $N=2, d=4$ superfield Born-Infeldaction with a second nonlinearly realized N=2 supersymmetry. The latter,together with the manifest N=2 supersymmetry, form a central-charge extended$N=4, d=4$ supersymmetry. We embed the Goldstone-Maxwell N=2 multiplet into aninfinite-dimensional off-shell supermultiplet of this N=4 supersymmetry andimpose an infinite set of covariant constraints which eliminate all extra N=2superfields through the Goldstone-Maxwell one. The Born-Infeld superfieldLagrangian density is one of these composite superfields. The constraints canbe solved by iterations to any order in the fields. We present the sought N=2Born-Infeld action up to the 10th order. It encompasses the action foundearlier by Kuzenko and Theisen to the 8th order from a self-dualityrequirement. This is a strong indication that the complete N=2 Born-Infeldaction with partially broken N=4 supersymmetry is also self-dual.
