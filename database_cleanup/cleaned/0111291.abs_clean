By considering 5--dimensional cosmological models with a bulk filled with aperfect fluid and a cosmological constant, we have found regular instantonicsolution which is free from any singularity at the origin of theextra--coordinate and describe 5--dimensional asymptotically anti de Sitterwormhole, when the bulk has a topology $ R \times S^4 $ and is filled with dustand a negative cosmological constant. Compactified brane-world instantons whichare built up from such instantonic solution describe either a single brane or astring of branes. Their analytical continuation to the pseudo--Riemannianmetric can give rise to either 4-dimensional inflating branes or solutions withthe same dynamical behaviour for extra--dimension and branes, in addition tomultitemporal solutions. Dust brane-world models with other spatial topologiesare also considered.
