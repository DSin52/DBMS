We construct the supersymmetric effective action at order alpha'^4 of theabelian open superstring. It includes the alpha'^4 terms in the abelianBorn-Infeld action, and in particular the leading derivative correction of theform d^4F^4. Besides linear supersymmetry this sector of the open stringeffective action also has a nonlinear supersymmetry. The terms d^4F^4 and theirfermionic partners have an arbitrary coefficient, and we discuss the possiblefate of such coefficients when higher orders in alpha' are included.
