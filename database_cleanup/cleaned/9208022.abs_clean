Authors: A. Marshakov

Comments: 15 pages, report FIAN/TD-8/92, revised and improved version

I present a short review of our results with S.Kharchev, A.Mironov, A.Morozovand A.Zabrodin on Generalized Kontsevich model which in a sense can beinterpreted as unifying ``string field theory'' for $c < 1$ minimal seriescoupled to 2d gravity. The problem of interpolation between different models isdiscussed. It is found that this problem is closely connected with``deformations'' within the set of solutions to KP hierarchy, described by asort of reparameterization of a spectral curve and change of asymptotics of thebasis in the Grassmannian. The $c \rightarrow 1$ limit is considered along thisline.
