We show that two-dimensional topological BF theories coupled to particlescarrying non-Abelian charge admit a new coupling involving the Lagrangemultiplier field. When applied to the gauge theoretic formulation of dilatonicgravity it gives rise to a source term for the gravitational field. We showthat the system admits black hole solutions.
