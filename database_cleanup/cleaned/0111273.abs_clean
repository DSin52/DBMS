The perturbative finiteness of various topological models (e.g. BF models)has its origin in an extra symmetry of the gauge-fixed action, the so-calledvector supersymmetry. Since an invariance of this type also exists for gravityand since gravity is closely related to certain BF models, vector supersymmetryshould also be useful for tackling various aspects of quantum gravity. Withthis motivation and goal in mind, we first extend vector supersymmetry of BFmodels to generic manifolds by incorporating it into the BRST symmetry withinthe Batalin-Vilkovisky framework. Thereafter, we address the relationshipbetween gravity and BF models, in particular for three-dimensional space-time.
