A proof of Goldstone's theorem is given for the case in which global chiralsymmetry is dynamically broken. The proof highlights a needed consistencybetween the exact Schwinger--Dyson equation for the fermion propagator and theexact Bethe--Salpeter equation for fermion--antifermion bound states. Acriterion, based on the Cornwall, Jackiw and Tomboulis effective action forcomposite operators, is provided for maintaining the consistency when theequations are modified by approximations. For gauge theories in which partialconservation of the axial current (PCAC) should hold, a constraint on theapproximations to the fermion--gauge boson vertex function is discussed, and avertex model is given which satisfies both the PCAC constraint and the vectorWard--Takahashi identity.
