By taking into account the effect of the would be Chern-Simons term, wecalculate the quantum correction to the Chern-Simons coefficient insupersymmetric Chern-Simons Higgs theories with matter fields in thefundamental representation of SU(n). Because of supersymmetry, the correctionsin the symmetric and Higgs phases are identical. In particular, the correctionis vanishing for N=3 supersymmetric Chern-Simons Higgs theories. The resultshould be quite general, and have important implication for the moreinteresting case when the Higgs is in the adjoint representation.
