Title: Modular Invariance as an Explanation for the Absence of Monopoles.

Comments: 13 pages, LaTex

It is shown that modular invariance provides a natural explanation for theabsence of monopoles when assumed to be a discrete gauge symmetry. It followsthat monopoles can not be seen because it is always possible to find a suitablegauge-fixing in which they are not present. This result relies upon an easy toprove but non-trivial property of the modular group. A modular-invariantformulation for the hamiltonian of the electromagnetism is given. No monopolearises if independent modular transformations are allowed at each point inspace-time where point-like charges are present.
