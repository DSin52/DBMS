It is pointed out that the energy of the bound states of D-branes and stringsis determined by the central charge of the space-time supersymmetry. Theuniversality which is seen at the black hole horizon appears also on thehas a minimum when considered as a function of the independent parameters(moduli). This provides a new evidence that the near-horizon space-timegeometry of the dilaton black holes can be represented by the bound states ofbranes. The axion-dilaton dyonic black holes have the mass formula of thenon-threshold type bound state. Upon uplifting to higher dimensions they maygive information about such states.
