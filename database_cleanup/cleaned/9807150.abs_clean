We consider some long multiplets describing bulk massive excitations ofM-theory two-branes and IIB string three-branes which correspond to ``nonchiral'' primary operators of the boundary OSp(8/4) and SU(2,2/4)superconformal field theories. Examples of such multiplets are the ``radial''modes on the branes, including up to spin 4 excitations, which may be thenconsidered as prototypes of states which are not described by the K-K spectrumof the corresponding supergravity theories on AdS_4 x S_7 and AdS_5 x S_5respectively.
