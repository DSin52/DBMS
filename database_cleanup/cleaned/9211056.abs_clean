Magnetic monopole solutions to heterotic string theory are discussed intoroidal compactifications to four spacetime dimensions. Particular emphasis isplaced on the relation to previously studied fivebrane solutions in tendimensions and on the possibility of constructing exact monopole solutionsrelated to symmetric fivebranes.
