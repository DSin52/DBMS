Title: Gribov ambiguities and the fundamental domain

Comments: 18p with 8 figs. Lecture delivered at the NATO ASI ``Confinement,

Duality and Non-perturbative Aspects of QCD'', Newton Institute, Cambridge,UK, 23 June - 4 July, 1997This lecture is dedicated to the memory of Vladimir Gribov.We discuss the procedure of complete gauge fixing to avoid Gribov copies, aswell as results for the low-lying glueball spectrum in intermediate volumes forthe torus and for the sphere that became available recently.
