Irrational conformal field theory (ICFT) includes rational conformal fieldtheory as a small subspace, and the affine-Virasoro Ward identities describethe biconformal correlators of ICFT. We reformulate the Ward identities as anequivalent linear partial differential system with flat connections and newnon-local conserved quantities. As examples of the formulation, we solve thesystem of flat connections for the coset correlators, the correlators of theaffine-Sugawara nests and the high-level $n$-point correlators of ICFT.
