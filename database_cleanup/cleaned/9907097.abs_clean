Three-photon vertex in a dense degenerated plasma is calculated. It isdiscovered the polarization tensor has the longitudinal part which makespossible an interaction between transverse and longitudinal modes in themedium. Using dispersion relations it is shown that the only kinematicallypermitted type of the photon splitting is the decay of the transverse photon totwo plasmons.
