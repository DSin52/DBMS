By using anholonomic frames in (pseudo) Riemannian spaces we defineanisotropic extensions of Euclidean Taub-NUT spaces. With respect to coordinateframes such spaces are described by off-diagonal metrics which could bediagonalized by corresponding anholonomic transforms. We define the conditionswhen the 5D vacuum Einstein equations have as solutions anisotropic Taub-NUTspaces. The generalized Killing equations for the configuration space ofanisotropically spinning particles (anisotropic spinning space) are analyzed.Simple solutions of the homogeneous part of these equations are expressed interms of some anisotropically modified Killing-Yano tensors. The generalresults are applied to the case of the four-dimensional locally anisotropicTaub-NUT manifold with Euclidean signature. We emphasize that all constructionsare for(pseudo) Riemannian spaces defined by vacuum soltions, with genericanisotropy, of 5D Einstein equations, the solutions being generated by applyingthe moving frame method.
