Authors: Alfred S. Goldhaber (ITP, SUNY Stony Brook)

Comments: 10 pages, LATEX with no macros. Added discussion of another

fundamental soliton, the magnetic vortex, explaining why it doesn'tfractionate chargeJackiw and Rebbi found two types of intrinsically stable or `fundamental'soliton (kinks in 1+1 D and magnetic monopoles in 3+1 D) which can carry piecesof elementary-particle charges. After two decades there are no more, and it isargued here why that is inevitable.
