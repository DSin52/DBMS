There is an interesting dichotomy between a space-time metric considered asexternal field in a flat background and the same considered as an intrinsicpart of the geometry of space-time. We shall describe and compare two otherexternal fields which can be absorbed into an appropriate redefinition of thegeometry, this time a noncommutative one. We shall also recall some previousincidences of the same phenomena involving bosonic field theories. It is knownthat some such theories on the commutative geometry of space-time can bere-expressed as abelian-gauge theory in an appropriate noncommutative geometry.The noncommutative structure can be considered as containing extra modes all ofwhose dynamics are given by the one abelian action.
