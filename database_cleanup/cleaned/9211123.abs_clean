By consireding representation theory for non-associative algebras weconstruct the fundamental and adjoint representations of the octonion algebra.We then show how these representations by associative matrices allow aconsistent octonionic gauge theory to be realised. We find thatnon-associativity implies the existence of new terms in the transformation lawsof fields and the kinetic term of an octonionic Lagrangian.
