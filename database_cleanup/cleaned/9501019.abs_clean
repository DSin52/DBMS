Title: Some conclusions for noncritical string theory drawn from two- and

three-point functions in the Liouville sectorAuthors: H. Dorn and H.-J. Otto

Comments: 11 pages, latex, no figures, to appear in the proceedings of the

XXVIII. Int. Symp. on the Theory of Elementary Particles, Wendisch-Rietz,August 30 - September 3, 1994Starting from the known expression for the three-point correlation functionsfor Liouville exponentials with generic real coefficients at we can prove theLiouville equation of motion at the level of three-point functions. Based onthe analytical structure of the correlation functions we discuss a possiblemass shell condition for excitations of noncritical strings and make someobservations concerning correlators of Liouville fields.
