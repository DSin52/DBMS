Duality symmetric electromagnetic action a la Schwarz-Sen is shown to appearnaturally in a chain of equivalent actions which interchange equations ofmotion with Bianchi identities. Full symmetry of the electromagnetic stresstensor is exploited by generalizing this duality symmetric action to allow fora space-time dependent mixing angle between electric and magnetic fields. Therotated fields are shown to satisfy Maxwell-like equations which involve themixing angle as a parameter, and a generalized gauge invariance of the newaction is established.
