We describe abstract (p,q) string networks which are the string networks ofSen without the information about their embedding in a background spacetime.The non-perturbative dynamical formulation invented for spin networks, in termsof causal evolution of dual triangulations, is applied to them. The formaltransition amplitudes are sums over discrete causal histories that evolve (p,q)string networks. The dynamics depend on two free SL(2,Z) invariant functionswhich describe the amplitudes for the local evolution moves.
