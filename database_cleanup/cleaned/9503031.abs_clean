Starting from string field theory for 2d gravity coupled to c=1 matter weanalyze N-point off-shell tree amplitudes of discrete states. The amplitudesexhibit the pole structure and we use the oscillator representation to extractthe residues. The residues are generated by a simple effective action. We showthat the effective action can be directly deduced from a string field action ina special transversal-like gauge.
