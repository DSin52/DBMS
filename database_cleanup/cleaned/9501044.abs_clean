We consider integrable models of the Haldane-Shastry type with open boundaryconditions. We define monodromy matrices, obeying the reflection equation,which generate the symmetries of these models. Using a map to theCalogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian of BC type, we derive the spectrum and thehighest weight eigenstates.
