Yang-Mills TheoriesAuthors: I.L. Buchbinder

"Supersymmetry and Quantum Symmetries", Dubna, Russia, July 26-31, to appearin the ProceedingsWe study a problem of low-energy effective action in N=4 super Yang-Millstheories. Using harmonic superspace approach we consider N=4 SYM in terms ofunconstrained N=2 superfield and apply N=2 background field method to findingeffective action for N=4 SU(n) SYM broken down to U(n)$^{n-1}$. Generalstructure of leading low-energy corrections to effective action is discussedand calculational procedure for their explicit finding is presented.
