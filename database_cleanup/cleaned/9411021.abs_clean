The basic concepts of non-commutative probability theory are reviewed andapplied to the large $N$ limit of matrix models. We argue that this is theappropriate framework for constructing the master field in terms of which large$N$ theories can be written. We explicitly construct the master field in anumber of cases including QCD$_2$. There we both give an explicit constructionof the master gauge field and construct master loop operators as well. Mostimportant we extend these techniques to deal with the general matrix model, inwhich the matrices do not have independent distributions and are coupled. Wecan thus construct the master field for any matrix model, in a well definedHilbert space, generated by a collection of creation and annihilationoperators---one for each matrix variable---satisfying the Cuntz algebra. Wealso discuss the equations of motion obeyed by the master field.
