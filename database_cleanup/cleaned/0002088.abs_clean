We consider a relativistic brane propagating in Minkowski spacetime describedby any action which is local in its worldvolume geometry. We examine theconservation laws associated with the Poincar\'e symmetry of the backgroundfrom a worldvolume geometrical point of the view. These laws are exploited toexplore the structure of the equations of motion. General expressions areprovided for both the linear and angular momentum for any action depending onthe worldvolume extrinsic curvature. The conservation laws are examined inperturbation theory. It is shown how non-trivial solutions with vanishingenergy-momentum can be constructed in higher order theories. Finally,subtleties associated with boundary terms are examined in the context of thebrane Einstein-Hilbert action.
