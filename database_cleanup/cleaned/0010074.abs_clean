added, typo correctedThe motivations for the construction of an 8-component representation offermion fields based on a two dimensional representation of time reversaltransformation and CPT invariance are discussed. Some of the elementaryproperties of the quantum field theory in the 8-component representation arestudied. It includes the space-time and charge conjugation symmetries, theimplementation of a reality condition, the construction of interactiontheories, the field theoretical imaginary- and real-time approach tothermodynamics of fermionic systems, the quantization of fermion fields, theirparticle content and the Feynman rules for perturbation theories. It is shownthat in the new presentation, a CPT violation can be formulated in principle.The construction of interaction theories in the 8-component theory for fermionsis shown to be constrained by the CPT invariance. The short distance behaviorand relativistic covariance are studied. In the path integral representation ofthe thermodynamical potential, the conventional imaginary-time approach isshown to be smoothly connected to a real-time thermal field theory in the8-component representation for fermion fields without any additionalsubtraction of infinities. The metastability at zero density and the nature ofthe spontaneous CP violation in color superconducting phases of stronginteraction ground states are clarified.
