Recent proofs of the convergence of the linear delta expansion in zero and inone dimensions have been limited to the analogue of the vacuum generatingfunctional in field theory. In zero dimensions it was shown that with anappropriate, $N$-dependent, choice of an optimizing parameter $\l$, which is animportant feature of the method, the sequence of approximants $Z_N$ tends to$Z$ with an error proportional to ${\rm e}^{-cN}$. In the present paper weestablish the convergence of the linear delta expansion for the connectedvacuum function $W=\ln Z$. We show that with the same choice of $\l$ thecorresponding sequence $W_N$ tends to $W$ with an error proportional to ${\rme}^{-c\sqrt N}$. The rate of convergence of the latter sequence is governed bythe positions of the zeros of $Z_N$.
