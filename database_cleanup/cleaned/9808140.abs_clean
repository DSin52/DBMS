We consider one-loop quantum corrections to soliton energies and centralcharges in the supersymmetric $\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon models in 1+1dimensions. In both models, we unambiguously calculate the correction to theenergy in a simple renormalization scheme and obtain $\Delta H = - m/(2\pi)$,in agreement with previous results. Furthermore, we show that there is anidentical correction to the central charge, so that the BPS bound remainssaturated in the one-loop approximation. We extend these results to arbitrary1+1 dimensional supersymmetric theories.
