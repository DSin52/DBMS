Title: Physical Meaning of Quantum Space-Time Symmetries

Authors: Andrei Demichev

Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX; one reference and the corresponding remark in the

text have been addedA definition is given and the physical meaning of quantum transformations ofa non-commutative configuration space (quantum group coactions) is discussed.It is shown that non-commutative coordinates which are transformed by quantumgroups are the natural generalization of the notion of a tensor operator forusual groups and that the quantum group coactions induce semigroups oftransformations of states of a system. Two examples of non-commutativetransformations and the corresponding semigroups are considered.
