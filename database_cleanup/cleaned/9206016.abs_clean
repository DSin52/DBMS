Classical solutions of equations of motion in low energy effective fieldtheory, describing fundamental charged heterotic string, are found. Thesesolutions automatically carry an electric current equal to the charge per unitlength, and hence are accompanied by both, electric and magnetic fields. Forcebetween two parallel strings vanish due to cancellation between electric andmagnetic forces, and also between graviton, dilaton, and antisymmetric tensorfield induced forces. Multi-string solutions describing configuration ofparallel strings are also found. Finally, the solutions are shown to possesspartially broken space-time supersymmetry.
