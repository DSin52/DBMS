Improving on an earlier proposal, we construct the gauge theories of thequantum groups $U_q(N)$. We find that these theories are consistent also withan ordinary (commuting) spacetime. The bicovariance conditions of the quantumdifferential calculus are essential in our construction. The gauge potentialsand the field strengths are $q$-commuting ``fields", and satisfy$q$-commutation relations with the gauge parameters. The transformation rulesof the potentials are given explicitly, and generalize the ordinaryinfinitesimal gauge variations. The $q$-lagrangian invariant under the $U_q(N)$variations has the Yang-Mills form $\Fmn^i \Fmn^j g_{ij}$, the ``quantummetric'' $g_{ij}$ being a generalization of the Killing metric.
