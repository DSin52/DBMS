We construct the N=1 supersymmetric extension of the polytropic gas dynamics.We give both the Lagrangian as well as the Hamiltonian description of thissystem. We construct the infinite set of "Eulerian'' conserved chargesassociated with this system and show that they are in involution, therebyproving complete integrability of this system. We construct the SUSY -Bextension of this system as well and comment on the similarities anddifferences between this system and an earlier construction of thesupersymmetric Chaplygin gas. We also derive the N=1 supersymmetric extensionof the elastic medium equations, which, however, do not appear to beintegrable.
