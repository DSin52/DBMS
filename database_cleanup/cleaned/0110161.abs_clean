We consider the Maldacena conjecture applied to the near horizon geometry ofa D1-brane in the supergravity approximation and present numerical results of atest of the conjecture against the boundary field theory calculation usingsupersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ). We present numericalresults with approximately 1000 times as many states as we previouslyconsidered. These results support the Maldacena conjecture and are within10-15% of the predicted numerical results in some regions. Our results arestill not sufficient to demonstrate convergence, and, therefore, cannot beconsidered to a numerical proof of the conjecture. We present a method forusing a ``flavor'' symmetry to greatly reduce the size of the basis and discussa numerical method that we use which is particularly well suited for this typeof matrix element calculation.
