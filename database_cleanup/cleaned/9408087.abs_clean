Explicit expressions are presented for general branching functions for cosetsof affine Lie algebras $\hat{g}$ with respect to subalgebras $\hat{g}^\prime$for the cases where the corresponding finite dimensional algebras $g$ and$g^\prime$ are such that $g$ is simple and $g^\prime$ is either simple or sumsof $u(1)$ terms. A special case of the latter yields the string functions. Ourderivation is purely algebraical and has its origin in the results on the BRSTcohomology presented by us earlier. We will here give an independent and simpleproof of the validity our results. The method presented here generalizes in astraightforward way to more complicated $g$ and $g^\prime$ such as {\it e g }sums of simple and $u(1)$ terms.
