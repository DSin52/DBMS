Title: Regular charged black hole with a charged de Sitter core

Authors: W.F. Kao

Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure, some modifications added

We show that there is a class of regular charged black hole with a charged deSitter core similar to the de Sitter-Schwarzschild black hole. One can showthat the total energy momentum tensor for the static and spherically symmetricphoton field can be made conserved even the Coulomb like energy momentum tensorfor photon is not conserved alone. Possible impact and the numerical solutionsof the charged black hole will be shown in this paper.
