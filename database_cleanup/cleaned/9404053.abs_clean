Title: Modular Invariance and Characteristic Numbers

Comments: 14 pages

Journal-ref: Commun.Math.Phys. 174 (1995) 29-42

We show that a general miraculous cancellation formula, the divisibility ofcertain characteristic numbers and some other topologiclal results are con-sequences of the modular invariance of elliptic operators on loop spaces.Previously we have shown that modular invariance also implies the rigidity ofmany elliptic operators on loop spaces.
