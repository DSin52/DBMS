We study the spectrum of 1+1 dimensional large $N$ QCD coupled to an adjointMajorana fermion of mass $m$. As $m\to 0$ this model makes a transition fromconfinement to screening. We argue that in this limit the spectrum becomescontinuous for mass greater than twice the mass of the lightest bound state.This critical mass is nothing but the threshold for a decay into two lighteststates. We present numerical results based on DLCQ that appear to support ourclaim.
