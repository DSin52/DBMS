We consider a massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling in$\mathbf{S}^{1}\times \mathbf{S}^{3}$ space, which mimics the thermal expandinguniverse, and calculate explicitly all relevant thermodynamical functions inthe low- and high-temperature regimes, extending previous analysis of entropybounds and entropy/energy ratios performed in the conformal case. For hightemperatures, new mass-dependent entropy ratios are established which,differently to the conformal limit, fulfil Bekenstein's and Verlinde's boundsin the physical region.
