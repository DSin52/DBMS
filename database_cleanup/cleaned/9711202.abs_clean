We study dynamics of triple junction of (p,q) strings in Type IIB stringtheory. We probe tension and mass density of (p,q) strings by studying harmonicfluctuations of the triple junction. We show that they agree perfectly with BPSformula provided suitable geometric interpretation of the junction is given. Weprovide a precise statement of BPS limit and force-balance property. At weakcoupling and sufficiently dense limit, we argue that (p,q)-string embedded instring network is a `wiggly string', whose low-energy dynamics can be describedvia renormalization group evolved, smooth effective non-relativistic string. Wealso suggest the possibility that, upon Type IIB strings are promoted toM-theory membrane, there can exist `evanescent' bound-states at triple junctionin the continuum.
