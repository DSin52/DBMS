Title: From Wrapped Supermembrane to M(atrix) Theory From Wrapped Supermembrane

to M(atrix) TheoryAuthors: Tamiaki Yoneya

Comments: Talk presented at the 3rd Sakharov International Conference on

Physics, Moscow, June, 2002The issue of justifying the matrix-theory proposal is revisited. We firstdiscuss how the matrix-string theory is derived directly starting from theeleven dimensional supermembrane wrapped around a circle of radius$R=g_s\ell_s$, without invoking any stringy assumptions, such as S- andT-dualities. This derivation provides us a basis for studying both string($R\to 0)$- and M ($R\to \infty$)-theory limits of quantum membrane theory in asingle unified framework. In particular, we show that two different boosts ofsupermembrane, namely one of unwrapped membrane along the M-theory circle andthe other of membrane wrapped about a transervse direction which is orthogonalto the M-theory circle, give the same matrix theory in the 11 dimensionallimit, $R\to \infty$ (with $N\to \infty$). We also discuss briefly the natureof possible covariantized matrix (string) theories.
