We reexamine the oscillator construction of the D25-brane solution and thetachyon fluctuation mode of vacuum string field theory given previously. Boththe classical solution and the tachyon mode are found to violateinfinitesimally their determining equations in the level cut-offregularization. We study the effects of these violations on physical quantitiessuch as the tachyon mass and the ratio of the energy density of the solutionrelative to the D25-brane tension. We discuss a possible way to resolve theproblem of reproducing the expected value of one for the ratio.
