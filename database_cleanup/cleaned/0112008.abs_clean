We discuss the partners of the stress energy tensor and their structure inLogarithmic conformal field theories. In particular we draw attention to thefundamental differences between theories with zero and non-zero central charge.However they are both characterised by at least two independent parameters. Weshow how, by using a generalised Sugawara construction, one can calculate thelogarithmic partner of T. We show that such a construction works in the c=-2theory using the conformal dimension one primary currents which generate alogarithmic extension of the Kac-Moody algebra.
