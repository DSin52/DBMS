We consider NS-NS superstring model with several ``magnetic'' parameters$b_s$ (s=1, ...,N) associated with twists mixing a compact $S^1$ direction withangles in $N$ spatial 2-planes of flat 10-dimensional space. It generalizes theKaluza-Klein Melvin model which has single parameter $b$. The correspondingU-dual background is a R-R type IIA solution describing an orthogonalintersection of $N$ flux 7-branes. Like the Melvin model, the NS-NS stringmodel with $N$ continuous parameters is explicitly solvable; we present itsperturbative spectrum and torus partition function explicitly for the N=2 case.For generic $b_s$ (above some critical values) there are tachyons in the $S^1$winding sector. A remarkable feature of this model is that while in the MelvinN=1 case all supersymmetry is broken, a fraction of it may be preserved for $N>1$ by making a special choice of the parameters $b_s$. Such solvable NS-NSmodels may be viewed as continuous-parameter analogs of non-compact orbifoldmodels. They and their U-dual R-R fluxbrane counterparts may have some``phenomenological'' applications. In particular, in N=3 case one finds aspecial 1/4 supersymmetric R-R 3-brane background. Putting Dp-branes in flattwisted NS-NS backgrounds leads to world-volume gauge theories with reducedamount of supersymmetry. We also discuss possible ways of evolution of unstablebackgrounds towards stable ones.
