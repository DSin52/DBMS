In this work we propose an alternative description of the quantum mechanicsof a massive and spinning free particle in anti-de~Sitter spacetime, using aphase space rather than a spacetime representation. The regularizing characterof the curvature appears clearly in connection with a notion of localization inphase space which is shown to disappear in the zero curvature limit. We show inparticular how the anti-de~Sitter optimally localized (coherent) statescontract to plane waves as the curvature goes to zero. In the first part wegive a detailed description of the classical theory {\it \a la Souriau\/}. Thisserves as a basis for the quantum theory which is constructed in the secondpart using methods of geometric quantization. The invariant positive K\"ahlerpolarization that selects the anti-de~Sitter quantum elementary system is shownto have as zero curvature limit the Poincar\'e polarization which is no longerK\"ahler. This phenomenon is then related to the disappearance of the notion oflocalization in the zero curvature limit.
