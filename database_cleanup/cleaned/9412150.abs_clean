Title: Black Hole Solutions in String Theory

Comments: Based on talks given at MRST 94, McGill University and at

Mini-workshop on Extended Objects, Newton Institute, March 1994, 4 pages, TeXWe present two-parameter solutions of the low-energy four-dimensionalheterotic string which in the extremal limit reduce to supersymmetric monopole,string and domain wall solutions. The effective scalar coupling to the Maxwellfield, $e^{-\alpha \phi} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$, gives rise to a new stringblack hole with $\alpha = \sqrt{3}$, in contrast to the pure dilaton black holesolution which has $\alpha=1$. Implications of string/fivebrane duality in$D=10$ to four-dimensional dualities are discussed.
