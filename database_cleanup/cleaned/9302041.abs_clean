Following the approach of Grignani and Nardelli [1], we show how to cast thetwo-dimensional model $L \sim curv^2 + torsion^2 + cosm.const$ -- and in factany theory of gravity -- into the form of a Poincare gauge theory. By means ofdiffeomorphism invariance of the action still leads to a nasty constraintalgebra. Moreover, by simple changes of variables (e.g. in a path integral) onecan reabsorb all the modifications of the original theory.
