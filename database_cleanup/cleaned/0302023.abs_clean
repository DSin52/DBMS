We analyse the effect of general brane kinetic terms for bulk scalars,fermions and gauge bosons in theories with extra dimensions, with and withoutsupersymmetry. We find in particular a singular behaviour when these termscontain derivatives orthogonal to the brane. This is brought about by$\delta(0)$ divergences arising at second and higher order in perturbationtheory. We argue that this behaviour can be smoothed down by classicalrenormalization.
