Title: Some Three Generation (0,2) Calabi-Yau Models

Comments: Another very minor change to data in Example 4

Journal-ref: Phys. Lett. B349 (1995) 76

It has recently been realized that a large class of Calabi-Yau models inwhich the VEV of the gauge connection is not set equal to the spin connectionof the Calabi-Yau manifold are valid classical solutions of string theory. Weprovide some examples of three generation models based on such generalizedCalabi-Yau compactifications, including models with observable gauge group$SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$.
