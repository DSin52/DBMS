proofs, references detailedPhysicsThe prequantization map for a Poisson-Gerstenhaber algebra of dynamicalvariables represented by differential forms within the polysymplecticformulation of the De Donder--Weyl covariant Hamiltonian field theory ispresented and the corresponding prequantum Schroedinger equation for anon-homogeneous form valued wave function is derived. This is the first steptoward understanding the procedures of covariant precanonical fieldquantization from the point of view of geometric quantization.
