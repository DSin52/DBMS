We extend a recently proposed non-local and non-covariant version of theThirring model to the finite-temperature case. We obtain a completely bosonizedexpression for the partition function, describing the thermodynamics of thecollective modes which are the underlying excitations of this system. From thisresult we derive closed formulae for the free-energy, specific-heat, two-pointcorrelation functions and momentum distribution, as functionals ofelectron-electron coupling potentials.
