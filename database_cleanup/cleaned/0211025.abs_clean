We consider the evolution of massive scalar fields in (asymptotically) deSitter spacetimes of arbitrary dimension. Through the proposed dS/CFTcorrespondence, our analysis points to the existence of new nonlocal dualitiesfor the Euclidean conformal field theory. A massless conformally coupled scalarfield provides an example where the analysis is easily explicitly extended to'tall' background spacetimes.
