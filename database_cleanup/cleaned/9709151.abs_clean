233-249Semiclassical approximation based on extracting a c-number classicalcomponent from quantum field is widely used in the quantum field theory.Semiclassical states are considered then as Gaussian wave packets in thefunctional Schrodinger representation and as Gaussian vectors in the Fockrepresentation. We consider the problem of divergences and renormalization inthe semiclassical field theory in the Hamiltonian formulation. Althoughdivergences in quantum field theory are usually associated with loop Feynmangraphs, divergences in the Hamiltonian approach may arise even at the treelevel. For example, formally calculated probability of pair creation in theleading order of the semiclassical expansion may be divergent. This observationwas interpretted as an argumentation for considering non-unitary evolutiontransformations, as well as non-equivalent representations of canonicalcommutation relations at different time moments. However, we show that thisdifficulty can be overcomed without the assumption about non-unitary evolution.We consider first the Schrodinger equation for the regularized field theorywith ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs. We study the problem of making a limitto the local theory. To consider such a limit, one should impose not only therequirement on the counterterms entering to the quantum Hamiltonian but alsothe requirement on the initial state in the theory with cutoffs. We find such arequirement in the leading order of the semiclassical expansion and show thatit is invariant under time evolution. This requirement is also presented as acondition on the quadratic form entering to the Gaussian state.
