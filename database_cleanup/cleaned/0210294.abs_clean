Within the context of traditional logarithmic grand unification at M_GUT =10^(16) GeV, we show that it is nevertheless possible to observe certain GUTstates such as X and Y gauge bosons at lower scales, perhaps even in the TeVrange. We refer to such states as ``GUT precursors.'' Such states offer aninteresting alternative possibility for new physics at the TeV scale, even whenthe scale of gauge coupling unification remains high, and suggest that it maybe possible to probe GUT physics directly even within the context of high-scalegauge coupling unification. More generally, our results also suggest that it ispossible to construct self-consistent ``hybrid'' models containing widelyseparated energy scales, and give rise to a Kaluza-Klein realization ofnon-trivial fixed points in higher-dimensional gauge theories. We also discusshow such theories may be deconstructed at high energies.
