We construct the quantum versions of the monodromy matrices of KdV theory.The traces of these quantum monodromy matrices, which will be called as ``${\bfT}$-operators'', act in highest weight Virasoro modules. The ${\bfT}$-operators depend on the spectral parameter $\lambda$ and their expansionaround $\lambda = \infty$ generates an infinite set of commuting Hamiltoniansof the quantum KdV system. The ${\bf T}$-operators can be viewed as thecontinuous field theory versions of the commuting transfer-matrices ofintegrable lattice theory. In particular, we show that for the values$c=1-3{{(2n+1)^2}\over {2n+3}} , n=1,2,3,... $of the Virasoro central chargethe eigenvalues of the ${\bf T}$-operators satisfy a closed system offunctional equations sufficient for determining the spectrum. For theground-state eigenvalue these functional equations are equivalent to those ofmassless Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for the minimal conformal field theory${\cal M}_{2,2n+3}$; in general they provide a way to generalize the techniqueof Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz to the excited states. We discuss ageneralization of our approach to the cases of massive field theories obtainedby perturbing these Conformal Field Theories with the operator $\Phi_{1,3}$.The relation of these ${\bf T}$-operators to the boundary states is alsobriefly described.
