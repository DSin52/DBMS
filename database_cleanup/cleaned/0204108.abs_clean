In this paper a new supersymmetric extension of conformal mechanics is putforward. The beauty of this extension is that all variables have a cleargeometrical meaning and the super-Hamiltonian turns out to be theLie-derivative of the Hamiltonian flow of standard conformal mechanics. In thispaper we also provide a supersymmetric extension of the other conformalgenerators of the theory and find their "square-roots". The whole superalgebraof these charges is then analyzed in details. We conclude the paper by showingthat, using superfields, a constraint can be built which provides the exactsolution of the system.
