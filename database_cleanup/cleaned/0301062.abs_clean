We study the Nonlinear (Polynomial, N-fold,...) Supersymmetry algebra inone-dimensional QM. Its structure is determined by the type of conjugationoperation (Hermitian conjugation or transposition) and described with the helpof the Super-Hamiltonian projection on the zero-mode subspace of a supercharge.We show that the SUSY algebra with transposition symmetry is always polynomialin the Hamiltonian if supercharges represent differential operators of finiteorder. The appearance of the extended SUSY with several (complex or real)supercharges is analyzed in details and it is established that no more than twoindependent supercharges may generate a Nonlinear superalgebra which can beappropriately specified as {\cal N} = 2 SUSY. In this case we find anon-trivial hidden symmetry operator and rephrase it as a non-linear functionof the Super-Hamiltonian on the physical state space. The full {\cal N} = 2Non-linear SUSY algebra includes "central charges" both polynomial andnon-polynomial (due to a symmetry operator) in the Super-Hamiltonian.
