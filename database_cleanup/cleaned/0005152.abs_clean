Using the path integral approach, we discuss the correlation functions of the$SL(2,\bfC)/SU(2)$ WZW model, which corresponds to the string theory on theEuclidean $AdS_3$. We obtain the two- and three-point functions for genericprimary fields in closed forms. By an appropriate change of the normalizationof the primary fields, our results coincide with those by Teschner, which wereobtained by using the bootstrap approach. The supergravity results are alsoobtained in the semi-classical limit.
