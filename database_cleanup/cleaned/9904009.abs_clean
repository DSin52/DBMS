Quantum causal histories are defined to be causal sets with Hilbert spacesattached to each event and local unitary evolution operators. The reflexivity,antisymmetry, and transitivity properties of a causal set are preserved in thequantum history as conditions on the evolution operators. A quantum causalhistory in which transitivity holds can be treated as ``directed'' topologicalquantum field theory. Two examples of such histories are described.
