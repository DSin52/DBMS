We revisit the quantum Hall system with no Zeeman splitting energy using thenoncommutative field theory. We analyze the BPS condition for thedelta-function interaction near the filling factor $\nu=1$. Multi-skyrmions areshown to saturate the BPS bounds. The dimension of the moduli space of $k$skyrmions is $4k+2$. Advantage of the noncommutative field description isdemonstrated through the derivation of the effective nonlinear $\sigma$ modelLagrangian.
