In this paper we consider compactifications of type I strings on Abelianorbifolds. We discuss the tadpole cancellation conditions for the general casewith D9-branes only. Such compactifications have (perturbative) heterotic dualswhich are also realized as orbifolds (with non-standard embedding of the gaugeconnection). The latter have extra twisted states that become massive onceorbifold singularities are blown-up. This is due to the presence ofperturbative heterotic superpotential with couplings between the extra twistedstates, the orbifold blow-up modes, and (sometimes) untwisted matter fields.Anomalous U(1) (generically present in such models) also plays an importantrole in type I-heterotic (tree-level) duality matching. We illustrate theseissues on a particular example of Z_3 \otimes Z_3 orbifold type I model (andits heterotic dual). The model has N=1 supersymmetry, U(4)^3 \otimes SO(8)gauge group, and chiral matter. We also consider compactifications of type Istrings on Abelian orbifolds with both D9- and D5-branes. We discuss tadpolecancellation conditions for a certain class of such models. We illustrate themodel building by considering a particular example of type I theorycompactified on Z_6 orbifold. The model has N=1 supersymmetry, [U(6)\otimesU(6)\otimes U(4)]^2 gauge group, and chiral matter. This would correspond to anon-perturbative chiral vacuum from the heterotic point of view.
