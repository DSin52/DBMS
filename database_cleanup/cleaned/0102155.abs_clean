In this review, we summarize exact results for the three-dimensional BTZblack hole. We use rigorous mathematical results to clarify the generalstructure and properties of this black hole spacetime and its microscopicdescription. In particular, we study the formation of the black hole by pointparticle collisions, leading to an exact analytic determination of the Choptuikscaling parameter. We also show that a `No Hair Theorem' follows immediatelyfrom a mathematical theorem of hyperbolic geometry, due to Sullivan. Amicroscopic understanding of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and decay rate formassless scalars, is shown to follow from standard results of conformal fieldtheory.
