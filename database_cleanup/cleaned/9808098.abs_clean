It is observed that some structures recently uncovered in the study ofCalogero-Sutherland models and anyons are close analogs of well-knownstructures of boundary conformal field theory. These examples of ``boundaryconformal quantum mechanics'', in spite of their apparent simplicity, have arather reach structure, including some sort of T-duality, and could provideuseful frameworks for testing general properties of boundary conformaltheories. Of particular interest are the duality properties of anyons andCalogero-Sutherland particles in presence of boundary-violations of conformalinvariance; these are here briefly analyzed leading to the conjecture of ageneral interconnection between (deformed) boundary conformal quantummechanics, T-type duality, and (``exchange'' or ``exclusion'') exoticstatistics. These results on the point-particle quantum-mechanics side arecompared with recent results on the action of T-duality on open strings thatsatisfy conformal-invariance-violating boundary conditions. Moreover, it isobserved that some of the special properties of anyon and Calogero-Sutherlandquantum mechanics are also enjoyed by the M(atrix) quantum mechanics which hasrecently attracted considerable attention.
