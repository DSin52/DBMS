String backgrounds associated with gauged $G/H$ WZNW models in general dependnon-trivially on $\alpha'$. We note, however, that there exists a localcovariant $\a'$-dependent field redefinition that relates the exactmetric-dilaton background corresponding to the $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ model to itsleading-order form ($D=2$ black hole). As a consequence, there exists a`scheme' in which the string effective equations have the latter as an exactsolution. However, the corresponding equation for the tachyon (which, likeother Weyl anomaly coefficients, has scheme-dependent form) still containscorrections of all orders in $\alpha'$. As a result, the `probes' (thetachyons) still feel the $\alpha'$-corrected background. The fieldredefinitions we discuss contain the dilaton terms in the metric transformationlaw. We comment on exact forms of the duality transformation in different`schemes'.
