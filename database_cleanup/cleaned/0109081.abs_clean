We search for a possible bosonic (i.e. non-supersymmetric) string/gaugetheory correspondence by using IIB and 0B strings as a guide. Our constructionis based on the low-energy bosonic string effective action modified by an extraform flux. The closed string tachyon can be stabilyzed if the AdS scale L doesnot exceed certain critical value, L<L_c. We argue that the extra form may begenerated as a soliton from 3-string junctions, similarly to the knownnon-perturbative (Jackiw-Rebbi-'t Hooft-Hasenfratz) mechanism in gaugetheories. The stable AdS_{13} x S^{13} solution is found, which apparentlyimplies the existence of a 12-dimensional AdS-boundary conformal field theorywith the SO(14) global symmetry in the large N 't Hooft limit. We alsogeneralize the conjectured AdS/CFT duality to finite temperature, and calculatethe `glueball' masses from the dilaton wave equation in the AdS black holebackground, in various spacetime dimensions.
