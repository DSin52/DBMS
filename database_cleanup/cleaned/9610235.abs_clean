Title: Properties of Supermembrane Axions

Authors: F. Aldabe

Comments: 25 pages, 2 figures. We no longer use the conjecture that M-theory is

a theory of membranes. We use instead the coupling of the membrane to 11dimensional supergravity to support our resultsIn the presence of membranes, M-theory becomes in the low energy limit 11dimensional supergravity action coupled to a supermembrane action. The fieldsof the first action are the same fields which couple to the membrane. It isshown that the axionic moduli of the membrane obtained by wrapping the threeform potential about three-cycles of a Calabi-Yau manifold can take nonzerointeger values. This novel property allows M-theory to have smooth transitionfrom the Kahler cone of a geometrical phase to a Kahler cone of anothergeometrical phase. Nongeometrical phases which define the boundary of theextended Kahler cone of the geometrical phases have discrete spectrum, and arecontinuously connected to the geometric phases. Using this new property, werelate the M-theory model dependent axion to the type IIA model dependent axionand show that a potential develops for the type IIA axion in the strongcoupling regime which does not seem to be generated by instantons. Evidence ispresented, using these moduli, which supports the Strominger conjecture on thewinding p-branes.
