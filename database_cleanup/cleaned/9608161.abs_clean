Title: Integrability as Effective Principle of Nonperturbative Field and String

TheoriesComments: 5 pages, LaTeX, no figures; based on a talk given at the Second

International Sakharov Conference, 20-24 May 1996, Moscow, RussiaOne of the perspectives in modern quantum field and string theory is relatedwith the attempts to go beyond the perturbation theory. It turns out that a keyprinciple in the formulation of all known non-perturbative results is {\itintegrability}, i.e. arising of the structures of completely integrablesystems. I discuss several important steps in this direction and speculate onits further possible development.
