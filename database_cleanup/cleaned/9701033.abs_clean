The gravitational measure on an arbitrary topological three-manifold isconstructed. The nontrivial dependence of the measure on the conformal factoris discussed. We show that only in the case of a compact manifold with boundarythe measure acquires a nontrivial dependence on the conformal factor which isgiven by the Liouville action. A nontrivial Jacobian (the divergent part of it)generates the Einstein-Hilbert action. The Hartle-Hawking wave function ofUniverse is given in terms of the Liouville action. In the gaussianapproximation to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation this result was earlier derived byBanks et al. Possible connection with the Chern-Simons gravity is alsodiscussed.
