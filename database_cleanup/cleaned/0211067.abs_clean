Conference in Physics (Moscow, Lebedev Physical Institute, June 24-29, 2002)We review a recent progress in constructing the low-energy effective actionof N=4 SYM theory. This theory is formulated in terms of N=2 harmonicsuperfields corresponding to N=2 vector multiplet and hypermultiplet. Such aformulation possesses the manifest N=2 supersymmetry and an extra hiddenon-shell supersymmetry. Exploring the hidden N=2 supersymmetry we proved thatthe known non-holomorphic potentials of the form ln W ln \bar{W} can beexplicitly completed by the appropriate hypermultiplet-dependent terms to theentire N=4 supersymmetric form. The non-logarithmic effective potentials do notadmit an N=4 completion and, hence, such potentials cannot occur in N=4supersymmetric theory. As a result we obtain the exact N=4 supersymmetriclow-energy effective action in N=4 SYM theory.
