We study N=1 dualities in four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories interms of wrapping D 6-branes around 3-cycles of Calabi-Yau threefolds in typeIIA string theory. We generalize the recent work of geometrical realization forthe models which have the superpotential corresponding to an $A_k$ typesingularity, to various models presented by Brodie and Strassler, consisting of$D_{k+2}$ superpotential of the form $W=Tr X^{k+1} + Tr XY^2$. We discuss alarge number of representations for the field $Y$, but with $X$ always in theadjoint (symmetric) [antisymmetric] representation for $SU (SO) [Sp]$ gaugegroups.
