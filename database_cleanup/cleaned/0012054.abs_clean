The D0-D6 system, which is not supersymmetric in the absence of aNeveu-Schwarz B-field, becomes supersymmetric if a suitable constant B-field isturned on. On one side of the supersymmetric locus, this system has a BPS boundstate, and on the other side it does not. After compactification on T^6, thisgives a simple example in which the number of 1/8 BPS states jumps as themoduli of the compactification are changed. The D0-D8 system in a B-field hastwo different supersymmetric loci, only one of which is continuously connectedto the familiar supersymmetric D0-D8 system without a B-field. In a certainrange, the D0-D8 system also has a BPS bound state. In the limit in which theB-field goes to infinity, supersymmetric D0-D6 and D0-D8 systems and theirbound states can be studied using noncommutative Yang-Mills theory.
