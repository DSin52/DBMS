We review the specific problems that arise when studying instantons on atorus. We discuss how the Nahm transformation shows that no exact charge oneinstanton on T**4 can exist. However, taking one of the directions (the time)to infinity, it can be shown that vacuum to vacuum tunnelling solutions exist.A precise description of the moduli space for T**3xR, studied numerically usinglattice techniques, remains an interesting open problem. New is an explicitapplication of the Nahm transformation to (anti-)selfdual constant curvaturesolutions on T**4 and a discussion of its properties relevant to instantons onT**3xR.
