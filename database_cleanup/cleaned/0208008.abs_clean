Title: Shortcuts in a Dynamical Universe and the Horizon Problem

We consider the dynamics of a FRW brane in a purely AdS background, from thepoint of view of the bulk, and explicitly construct the geodesical behaviour ofgravitational signs leaving and subsequently returning to the brane. Incomparison with photons following a geodesic inside the brane, we verify thatshortcuts exist, though they are extremely small for today's Universe. However,we show that at times just before nucleosynthesis, if high redshifts wereavailable, the effect could be sufficiently large to solve the horizon problem.Assuming an inflationary epoch in the brane evolution, we argue that theinfluence of those signs trought the extra dimension in the causal structurecannot be neglected. This effect could be relevant for probing the extradimension in inflationary scenarios.
