In this talk we report some results about the construction of solitonsolutions for the Affine and Conformal Affine Toda models using the Hirota'smethod. We obtain new classes of solitons connected to the degeneracies of theCartan matrix eigenvalues as well as to some particular features of therecursive scheme developed here. We obtain an universal mass formula for allthose solitons. The examples of $SU(6)$ and $Sp(3)$ are discussed in someParticles andFields, Campos do Jord\~ao - Brasil - January/93)
