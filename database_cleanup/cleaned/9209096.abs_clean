We give a geometrical set up for the semiclassical approximation to euclideanfield theories having families of minima (instantons) parametrized by suitablemoduli spaces ${\cal M}$. The standard examples are of course Yang-Mills theoryand non-linear $\sigma$-models. The relevant space here is a family of measurespaces $\tilde {\cal N} \ra {\cal M}$, with standard fibre a distributionspace, given by a suitable extension of the normal bundle to ${\cal M}$ in thespace of smooth fields. Over $\tilde {\cal N}$ there is a probability measure$d\mu$ given by the twisted product of the (normalized) volume element on${\cal M}$ and the family of gaussian measures with covariance given by thetree propagator $C_\phi$ in the background of an instanton $\phi \in {\cal M}$.The space of ``observables", i.e. measurable functions on ($\tilde {\cal N}, \,d\mu$), is studied and it is shown to contain a topological sector,corresponding to the intersection theory on ${\cal M}$. The expectation valueof these topological ``observables" does not depend on the covariance; it istherefore exact at all orders in perturbation theory and can moreover becomputed in the topological regime by setting the covariance to zero.
