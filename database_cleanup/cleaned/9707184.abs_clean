It is shown that the equations of motion of eleven-dimensional supergravityfollow from setting the dimension zero components of the superspace torsiontensor equal to the Dirac matrices. The proof of this assertion is facilitatedby the introduction of a connection taking its values in the Lie algebra of$Spin(1,10)\times R^+$.
