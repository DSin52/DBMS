``Heterotic'' and the ``Type I'' truncation. Both of them lead to an N=1nonlinear supersymmetrization of the D=10 cosmological constant. Thepropagating degrees of freedom in the Heterotic and Type I truncation are givenby the components of a D=10 vector multiplet and a single Majorana-Weyl spinor,respectively. As a by-product we find that, after the Type I truncation, theRamond-Ramond super ten-form provides an interesting reformulation of theVolkov-Akulov action. These results can be extended to all dimensions in whichspacetime filling D-branes exist, i.e. D=3,4,6 and 10.
