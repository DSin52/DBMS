clarificationsIn the first part of this work we consider an unstable non-BPSDp-\bar{Dp}-brane pair in Type II superstring theory. Turning on a backgroundNS-NS B-field (constant and nonzero along two spatial directions), we show thatthe tachyon responsible for the unstability has a complex GMS solitonicsolution, which is interpreted as the low energy remnant of the resultingD(p-2)-brane. In the second part, we apply these results to construct thenoncommutative soliton analogous of Witten's superconducting string. This isdone by considering the complex GMS soliton arising from the D3-\bar{D3}-braneannihilation in Type IIB superstring theory. In the presence of left-handedfermions, we apply the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal correspondence and the bosonizationtechnique to show that this object behaves like a superconducting wire.
