Title: Introduction to M Theory and AdS/CFT Duality

Comments: 26 pages; To be published in the Proceedings of a conference held in

An introductory survey of some of the developments that have taken place insuperstring theory in the past few years is presented. The main focus is onthree particular dualities. The first one is the appearance of an 11thdimension in the strong coupling limit of the type IIA theory, which give riseto M theory. The second one is the duality between the type IIB theorycompactified on a circle and M theory on a two-torus. The final topic is anintroduction to the recently proposed duality between superstring theory or Mtheory on certain anti de Sitter space backgrounds and conformally invariantquantum field theories.
