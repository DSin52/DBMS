Title: Review of W Strings

Authors: C.N. Pope

Comments: 13 pages

We review some of the recent developments in the construction of $W$-stringtheories. These are generalisations of ordinary strings in which thetwo-dimensional ``worldsheet'' theory, instead of being a gauging of theVirasoro algebra, is a gauging of a higher-spin extension of the Virasoroalgebra---a $W$ algebra. Despite the complexity of the (non-linear) $W$algebras, it turns out that the spectrum can be computed completely andexplicitly for more or less any $W$ string. The result is equivalent to a setof spectra for Virasoro strings with unusual central charge and intercepts.
