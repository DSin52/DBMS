The exact perturbation approach is used to derive the elementary correlationlengths $\xi_i$ and related mass gaps $m_i$ of the two-dimensional dilute A_Llattice model in regimes 1 and 2 for L odd from the Bethe Ansatz solution. Inregime 2 the A_3 model is the E_8 lattice realisation of the two-dimensionalIsing model in a magnetic field at T=T_c. The calculations for the A_3 model inregime 2 start from the eight thermodynamically significant string types foundin previous numerical studies. These string types are seen to be consistent inthe ordered high field limit. The eight masses obtained reduce with theapproach to criticality to the E_8 masses predicted by Zamolodchikov, thusproviding a further direct lattice determination of the E_8 mass spectrum.
