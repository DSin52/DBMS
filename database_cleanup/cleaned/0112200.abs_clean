We study Little String Theories (LST) with ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetryarising, in a suitable double scaling limit, from 5-branes in heterotic stringtheory or in the heterotic-like type II/$(-)^{F_L}\times {\rm shift}$. Thelimit in question, previously studied in the type II case, is such that theresulting holographically dual pairs, i.e. bulk string theory and LST are at afinite effective coupling. In particular, the internal $(2,2)$ SCFT on thestring theory side is non-singular and given by $SL(2)/U(1)\times SU(2)/U(1)$coset. In the type II orbifold case, we determine the orbifold action on theinternal SCFT and construct the boundary states describing the non-BPS massivestates of a completely broken $SO$ gauge theory, in agreement with the dualpicture of D5-branes in type II/$\Omega\times {\rm shift}$. We also describe adifferent orbifold action which gives rise to a $Sp$ gauge theory with $(1,1)$supersymmetry. In both the heterotic SO(32) and $E_8\times E_8$ cases, wedetermine the gauge bundles which correspond to the above SCFT and break downthe gauge groups to $SU(2)\times SO(28)$ and $E_7\times E_8$ respectively. Thedouble scaling limit in this case involves taking small instanton together withsmall string coupling constant limit. We determine the spectrum of chiral gaugeinvariant operators with the corresponding global symmetry charges on the LSTside and compare with the massless excitations on the string theory side,finding agreement for multiplicities and global charges.
