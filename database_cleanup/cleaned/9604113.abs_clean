The structure of state vector space for a general (non-anomalous) gaugetheory is studied within the Lagrangian version of the $Sp(2)$-symmetricquantization method. The physical {\it S}-matrix unitarity conditions areformulated. The general results are illustrated on the basis of simple gaugetheory models.
