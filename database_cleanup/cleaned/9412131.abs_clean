Trieste Spring School Lectures describing the author's opinions about blackhole evaporation and information loss. The remnant, or cornucopion scenario forthe endpoint of Hawking evaporation is described in detail. In this pictureinformation can be lost to the original asymptotic observer without violatingthe rules of quantum mechanics, because a black hole remnant is viewed as alarge space connected onto our own by an almost pointlike opening. It does notbehave like an elementary particle. Objections to remnants are refuted and the(remote) possibility of testing this scenario experimentally is discussed. Alsoincluded is a brief description of Susskind's picture of the stringy origin ofBekenstein-Hawking entropy. An attempt is made to argue that the cornucopionpicture and Susskind's model of the states responsible for black hole entropyare compatible with each other. Information is lost to the asymptotic observerin Hawking evaporation, but the information encoded in the BH entropy remainsin causal contact with him and is re-emitted with the Hawking radiation.
