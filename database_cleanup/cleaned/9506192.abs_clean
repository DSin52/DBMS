The non-linear sigma model of the dimensionally reduced Einstein (-Maxwell)theory is diagonally embedded into that of the two-dimensional heterotic stringtheory. Consequently, the embedded string backgrounds satisfy the(electro-magnetic) Ernst equation. In the pure Einstein theory, theMatzner-Misner SL(2,{\bf R}) transformation can be viewed as a change ofconformal structure of the compactified flat two-torus, and in particular itsintegral subgroup SL(2,{\bf Z}) acts as the modular transformation. The EhlersSL(2,{\bf R}) and SL(2,{\bf Z}) similarly act on another torus whose conformalstructure is induced through the Kramer-Neugebauer involution. Either of theMatzner-Misner and the Ehlers SL(2,{\bf Z}) can be embedded to a specialT-duality, and if the former is chosen, then the Ehlers SL(2,{\bf Z}) is shownto act as the S-duality on the four-dimensional sector. As an application weobtain some new colliding string wave solutions by using this embedding as wellas the inverse scattering method.
