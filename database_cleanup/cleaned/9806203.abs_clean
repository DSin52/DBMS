High frequency dispersion does not alter the low frequency spectrum ofHawking radiation from a single black hole horizon, whether the dispersionentails subluminal or superluminal group velocities. We show here that in thepresence of an inner horizon as well as an outer horizon the superluminal casediffers dramatically however. The negative energy partners of Hawking quantareturn to the outer horizon and stimulate more Hawking radiation if the fieldis bosonic or suppress it if the field is fermionic. This process leads toexponential growth or damping of the radiated flux and correlations among thequanta emitted at different times, unlike in the usual Hawking effect. Thesephenomena may be observable in condensed matter black hole analogs that exhibit"superluminal" dispersion.
