Title: Evaluating the Crane-Yetter Invariant

Comments: 4 pages

We provide an explicit formula for the invariant of 4-manifolds introduced byCrane and Yetter (in hep-th 9301062). A consequence of our result is theexistence of a combinatorial formula for the signature of a 4-manifold in termsof local data from a triangulation. Potential physical applications of ourresult exist in light of the fact that the Crane-Yetter invariant is a rigorousversion of ideas of Ooguri on B wedge F theory.
