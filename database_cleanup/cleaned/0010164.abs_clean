"Nonperturbative Quantum Effects 2000"The scaling form of the free--energy near a critical point allows for thedefinition of various universal ratios of thermodynamical amplitudes. Togetherwith the critical exponents they characterize the universality classes and maybe useful experimental quantities. We show how these universal quantities canbe computed for a particular class of universality by using several QuantumField Theory methods
