Title: Anomalies, counterterms and the ${\cal N} =0$ Polchinski-Strassler

solutionsComments: 38 pages, ReVTeX

The singularity structure of many IIB supergravity solutions asymptotic to$AdS_5 \times S^5$ becomes clearer when one considers the full ten dimensionalsolution rather than the dimensionally reduced solution of gauged supergravity.It has been shown that all divergences in the gravitational action of thedimensionally reduced spacetime can be removed by the addition of localcounterterms on the boundary. Here we attempt to formulate the countertermaction directly in ten dimensions for a particular class of solutions, the${\cal N} = 0$ Polchinski-Strassler solutions, which are dual to an ${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory perturbed by mass terms for all scalars and spinors. Thisinvolves constructing the solution perturbatively near the boundary. There is acontribution to the Weyl anomaly from the mass terms (which break the classicalconformal invariance of the action). The coefficient of this anomaly isreproduced by a free field calculation indicating a non-renormalisation theoreminherited from the ${\cal N} =4$ theory. We comment on the structure of thefull solutions and their construction from uplifting particular $ {\cal N} = 0$flows in five dimensions.
