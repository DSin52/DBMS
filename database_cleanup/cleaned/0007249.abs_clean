We apply the 3D reduction method we recently proposed for the N-particleBethe-Salpeter equation to the 4-particle case. We find that the writing of theBethe-Salpeter equation is not a straightforward task when N is larger or equalto 4, owing to the presence of mutually unconnected interactions, which couldlead to an overcounting of some diagrams in the resulting full propagator. Weovercome this difficulty in the N=4 case by including three counterterms in theBethe-Salpeter kernel. The application of our 3D reduction method to theresulting Bethe-Salpeter equation suggests us a modified 3D reduction method,which gives directly the 3D potential, without the need of writing theBethe-Salpeter kernel explicitly. The modified reduction method is usable forall N.
