The $2M$-boson representations of KP hierarchy are constructed in terms of$M$ mutually independent two-boson KP representations for arbitrary number $M$.Our construction establishes the multi-boson representations of KP hierarchy asconsistent Poisson reductions of standard KP hierarchy within the $R$-matrixscheme. As a byproduct we obtain a complete description of anyfinitely-many-field formulation of KP hierarchy in terms of Darboux coordinateswith respect to the first Hamiltonian structure. This results in a series ofrepresentations of $\Win1\,$ algebra made out of arbitrary even number of bosonfields.
