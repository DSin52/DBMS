The cosmic holographic principle suggested by Fischler and Susskind has beenexamined in (2+1)-dimensional cosmological models. Analogously to the(3+1)-dimensional counterpart, the holographic principle is satisfied in allflat and open universes. For (2+1)-dimensional closed universes the holographicprinciple cannot be realized in general. The principle cannot be maintained,neither introducing negative pressure matter nor matter with highlyunconventional equation of state.
