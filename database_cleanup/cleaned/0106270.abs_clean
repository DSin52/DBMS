The generalization of the form factor representation of the 2D Ising modelcorrelation function to the case of the general disposition of correlatingspins on a cylinder is given. The magnetic susceptibility on the lattice whereone of the dimensions $N$ is finite is calculated in both the para- andferromagnetic regions of the Ising coupling parameter. The singularitystructure in the complex temperature plane and the thermodynamic limit$N\to\infty$ are discussed.
