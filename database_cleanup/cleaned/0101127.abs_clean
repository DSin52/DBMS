Using the N = 2 off-shell formulation in harmonic superspace for N = 4 superYang-Mills theory, we present a representation of the one-loop effective actionwhich is free of so-called coinciding harmonic singularities and admits astraightforward evaluation of low-energy quantum corrections in the frameworkof an N = 2 superfield heat kernel technique. We illustrate our approach bycomputing the low-energy effective action on the Coulomb branch of SU(2) N = 4super Yang-Mills. Our work provides the first derivation of the low-energyaction of N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory directly in N = 2 superspace withoutany reduction to N = 1 superfields and for a generic background N = 2Yang-Mills multiplet.
