Authors: Bayram Tekin, Kamran Saririan, and Yutaka Hosotani

Comments: 10 pages, 5 Figures, LaTeX. To appear in the proceedings of

Quarks'98, Suzdal, Russia (May 18-24, 1998)In this talk, we give a brief discussion of complex monopole solutions in thethree dimensional Georgi-Glashow model with a Chern-Simons term. We find thatthere exist complex monopole solutions of finite action. They dominate the pathintegral and disorder the Higgs vacuum, but electric charges are not confined.Subtleties in the model and issues related to Gribov copies are also noted.
