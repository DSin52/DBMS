appear in "Essays on Mirror Manifolds, II")A large class of new 4-D superstring vacua with non-trivial/singulargeometries, spacetime supersymmetry and other background fields (axion,dilaton) are found. Killing symmetries are generic and are associated withnon-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields. Duality symmetriespreserving N=2 superconformal invariance are employed to generate a large classof explicit metrics for non-compact 4-D Calabi-Yau manifolds with Killingsymmetries.
