We present here all the real algebras $\cal{A}$ with dim$\cal{A}\leq $5 andall 6-dimensional nilpotent ones with symmetric, invariant and non-degeneratemetrics for which a WZW model can be constructed.In three and four dimensions there are no other algebras than the well known$SU(2)$, $SU(1,1)$, $E_2^c$ and $H_4$. There exist only one five-dimensionaland one six-dimensional nilpotent algebra with invariant non-degenerate metricand central charge $c=5, \,6$, respectively. We examine in details thefive-dimensional case and, by gauging an appropriate subgroup, four-dimensionalplane-wave string backgrounds are obtained. The corresponding background forthe six-dimensional case is flat.
