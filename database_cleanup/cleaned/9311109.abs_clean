Title: Lie Algebras and Braided Geometry

Comments: 19 pages (corrected title)

We show that every Lie algebra or superLie algebra has a canonical braidingon it, and that in terms of this its enveloping algebra appears as a flat spacewith braided-commuting coordinate functions. This also gives a new point ofview about $q$-Minkowski space which arises in a similar way as the envelopingalgebra of the braided Lie algebra $gl_{2,q}$. Our point of view fixes thesignature of the metric on $q$-Minkowski space and hence also of ordinaryMinkowski space at $q=1$. We also describe an abstract construction forleft-invariant integration on any braided group.
