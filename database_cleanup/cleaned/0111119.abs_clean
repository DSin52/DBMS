Typos corrected,reference and acknowledgment added, clarifying remarks and one formula insection 9 addedWe analyze properties of the Sp(2M) conformally invariant field equations inthe recently proposed generalized $\half M(M+1)$-dimensional space-time $\M_M$with matrix coordinates. It is shown that classical solutions of these fieldequations define a causal structure in $\M_M$ and admit a well-defineddecomposition into positive and negative frequency solutions that allowsconsistent quantization in a positive definite Hilbert space. The effect ofconstraints on the localizability of fields in the generalized space-time isanalyzed. Usual d-dimensional Minkowski space-time is identified with thesubspace of the matrix space $\M_M$ that allows true localization of thedynamical fields. Minkowski coordinates are argued to be associated with someClifford algebra in the matrix space $\M_M$. The dynamics of a conformal scalarand spinor in $\M_2$ and $\M_4$ is shown to be equivalent, respectively, to theusual conformal field dynamics of a scalar and spinor in the 3d Minkowskispace-time and the dynamics of massless fields of all spins in the 4d Minkowskispace-time. An extension of the electro-magnetic duality transformations to allspins is identified with a particular generalized Lorentz transformation in$\M_4$. The M=8 case is shown to correspond to a 6d chiral higher spin theory.The cases of M=16 (d=10) and M=32 (d=11) are discussed briefly.
