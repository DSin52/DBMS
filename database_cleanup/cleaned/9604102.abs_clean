Please typeset only the file rf.texWe first establish some general results connecting real and complex Liealgebras of first-order differential operators. These are applied to completelyclassify all finite-dimensional real Lie algebras of first-order differentialoperators in $R^2$. Furthermore, we find all algebras which are quasi-exactlysolvable, along with the associated finite-dimensional modules of analyticfunctions. The resulting real Lie algebras are used to construct newquasi-exactly solvable Schroedinger operators on $R^2$.
