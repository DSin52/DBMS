We found a gravity solution of p+1 dimensional extended object withSO(p)xSO(9-p) symmetry which has zero pressure and zero dilaton charge. Weexpect that this object is a residual tachyon dust after tachyon condensationof brane and anti-brane system discussed by Sen, recently. We also discuss theHawking temperature and some properties of this object.
