We investigate heterotic ground states in four dimensions in which N=4supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to N=2. N=4 supersymmetry is restored ata decompactification limit corresponding to $m_{3/2}\to 0$. We calculate thefull moduli dependent threshold corrections and confirm that they are supressedin the decompactification limit $m_{3/2}\to 0$ as expected from the restorationof N=4 supersymmetry. This should be contrasted with the behavior of thestandard N=2 groundstates where the coupling blow up linearly with the volumeof the decompactifying manifold. This mechanism provides a solution to thedecompactification problem for the gauge coupling constants.We also discuss how the mechanism can be implemented in ground states withlower supersymmetry.
