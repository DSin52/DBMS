The non critical string (2D gravity coupled to the matter with central charge$D$) is quantized taking care of both diffeomorphism and Weyl symmetries. Inincorporating the gauge fixing with respect to the Weyl symmetry, through thecondition $R_g=const$, one modifies the classical result of Distler and Kawai.In particular one obtains the real string tension for an arbitrary value ofcentral charge $D$.
