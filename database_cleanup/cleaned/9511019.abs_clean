Title: Special geometry and perturbative analysis of $N=2$ heterotic vacua

Comments: LateX using wstwocl, 5 pp. To appear in Procs. of the EPS95

Conference, BrusselsThe requirement of target-space duality and the use of nonrenormalizationtheorems lead to strong constraints on the perturbative prepotential thatencodes the low-energy effective action of $N=2$ heterotic superstring vacua.The analysis is done in the context of special geometry, which governs thecouplings of the vector multiplets. The presentation is kept at an introductorylevel.
