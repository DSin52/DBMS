The family of brane-world solutions of d+1-dimensional dilatonic gravity ispresented. It includes flat brane with small cosmological constant and (anti)de Sitter brane, dilatonic brane-world black holes (Schwarzschild-(anti-) deSitter, Kerr, etc). Gravitational and dilatonic perturbations around suchbranes are found. It is shown that near dilatonic brane-world black hole thegravity may be localized in a standard form. The brane corrections to Newtonlaw are estimated. The proposal to take into account the dilaton coupled branematter quantum effects is made. The corresponding effective action changes thestructure of 4d de Sitter wall. RG flow of four-dimensional Newton constant inIR and UV is briefly discussed.
