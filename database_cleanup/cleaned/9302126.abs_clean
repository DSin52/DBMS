A black hole solution to three dimensional general relativity with a negativecosmological constant has recently been found. We show that a slightmodification of this solution yields an exact solution to string theory. Thisblack hole is equivalent (under duality) to the previously discussed threedimensional black string solution. Since the black string is asymptoticallyflat and the black hole is asymptotically anti-de Sitter, this suggests thatstrings are not affected by a negative cosmological constant in threedimensions.
