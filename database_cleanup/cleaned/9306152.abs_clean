The phase spaceconsists of Clebsch coordinates at the surface of the vortex cells plus theLagrange coordinates of this surface plus the conformal metric. Using theHamiltonian dynamics we find an invariant probability distribution whichsatisfies the Liouville equation. The violations of the time reversalinvariance come from certain topological terms in effective energy of ourGibbs-like distribution. We study the topological aspects of the statistics anduse the string theory methods to estimate intermittency.
