Title: Symplectic and Poisson Geometry on Loop Spaces of Manifolds and

Nonlinear EquationsComments: 32 pages

We consider some differential geometric classes of local and nonlocal Poissonand symplectic structures on loop spaces of smooth manifolds which give naturalHamiltonian and multihamiltonian representations for some important nonlinearequations of mathematical physics and field theory such as nonlinear sigmamodels with torsion, degenerate Lagrangian systems of field theory, systems ofhydrodynamic type, N-component systems of Heisenberg magnet type,Monge-Amp\`ere equations, the Krichever-Novikov equation and others. Inaddition, we shall prove integrability of some class of nonhomogeneous systemsof hydrodynamic type and give a description of nonlinear partial differentialequations of associativity in $2D$ topological field theories (for some specialtype solutions of the Witten-Dijkgraaf-E.Verlinde-H.Verlinde (WDVV) system) asintegrable nondiagonalizable weakly nonlinear homogeneous systems ofhydrodynamic type.
