We examine how the consequences which follow from a recent model, both incosmology and at the elementary particle level have since been observationallyand experimentally confirmed. Some of the considerations of the model are alsojustified from alternative viewpoints. It is also shown how the standard BigBang and quark models can be recovered from the above theory.
