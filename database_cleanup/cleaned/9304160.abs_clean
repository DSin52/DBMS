The first ``Convegno Informale su Quantum Groups'' was held in Florence fromFebruary 3 to 6, 1993. This Convegno was conceived as an informal meeting tobring together all the italian people working in the field of quantum groupsand related topics. We are very happy indeed that about 30 theoreticalphysicists decided to take part presenting many aspects of this interesting andlive subject of research. We thank all the participants for the stimulating andnice atmosphere that has characterized the meeting. This paper has the intentto give a quick review in english of the contributions and related references.We think useful to include the complete addresses and coordinate data of theparticipants. It is our intention to diffuse these proceedings by e-mail troughelectronic data banks.
