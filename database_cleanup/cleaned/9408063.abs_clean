We investigate the cosmological solutions in closed bosonic string theory inthe presence of non zero tachyon condensate. We specifically obtain timedependent solutions which describe an anisotropic universe. We also discuss thenature of such time dependent solutions when small tachyon fluctuations aroundthe condensate are taken into account.
