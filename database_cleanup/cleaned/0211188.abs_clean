Authors: Chong-Sun Chu, Michela Petrini, Rodolfo Russo, Alessandro Tanzini

Comments: Proceeding of the 35th Symposium Ahrenshoop Aug 2002 and the Leuven

RTN-workshop Sept 2002Free string theory on the plane-wave background displays a discrete Z2symmetry exchanging the two transverse SO(4) rotation groups. This symmetryshould be respected also at the interacting level. We show that the zero modestructure proposed in hep-th/0208148 can be completed to a full kinematicalvertex, contrary to claims appeared in the previous literature. We also commenton the relation with recent works on the string-bit formalism and on thecomparison with the field theory side of the correspondence.
