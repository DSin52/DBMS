In the usual matrix-model approach to random discretized two-dimensionalmanifolds, one introduces n Ising spins on each cell, i.e. a discrete versionof 2D quantum gravity coupled to matter with a central charge n/2. Thematrix-model consists then of an integral over $2^{n}$ matrices, which we areunable to solve for $n>1$. However for a fixed genus we can expand in thecosmological constant g for arbitrary values of n, and a simple minded analysisof the series yields for n=0,1 and 2 the expected results for the exponent$\gamma_{string}$ with an amazing precision given the small number of termsthat we considered. We then proceed to larger values of n. Simple tests ofuniversality are successfully applied; for instance we obtain the sameexponents for n=3 or for one Ising model coupled to a one dimensional targetspace. The calculations are easily extended to states Potts models, through anintegration over $q^{n}$ matrices. We see no sign of the tachyonic instabilityof the theory, but we have only considered genus zero at this stage.
