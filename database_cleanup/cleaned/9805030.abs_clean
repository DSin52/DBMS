In the context of algebraic renormalization, the extended antifield formalismis used to derive the general forms of the anomaly consistency condition and ofthe Callan-Symanzik equation for generic gauge theories. A local version of thelatter is used to derive sufficient conditions for the vanishing of betafunctions associated to terms whose integrands are invariant only up to adivergence for an arbitrary non trivial non anomalous symmetry of theLagrangian. These conditions are independent of power counting restrictions andof the form of the gauge fixation.
