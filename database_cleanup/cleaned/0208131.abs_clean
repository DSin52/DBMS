Theoretical Methods in PhysicsIf C is a cocommutative coalgebra, a bialgebra structure can be given to thesymmetric algebra S(C). The symmetric product is twisted by a Laplace pairingand the twisted product of any number of elements of S(C) is calculatedexplicitly. This is used to recover important identities in the quantum fieldtheory of interacting scalar bosons.
