Authors: Andrew Chamblin (DAMTP, Cambridge U.)

Comments: 15 pages LaTeX, minor typos and LaTeX error corrected. A new section

on pinors and M-theory has been added. This is more or less the version toappear in the editorial volume ``Photon and Poincare Group'', ed. V.Dvoeglazov, Nova Science Pub., New York, NYWe classify elementary particles according to their behaviour under theaction of the full inhomogeneous Lorentz group. For fundamental fermions, thisapproach leads us to delineate fermions into eight basic families or `types',corresponding to the eight simply connected double covering groups of theinhomogeneous Lorentz group (the `pin' groups). Given this classification, itis natural to ask whether or not fermion type determines a superselection rule.It is also important to determine what observable effects fermion type mighthave; for example, can the type of a given fermion be determined by laboratoryexperiments? We address these questions by arguing that if multiple fermiontypes really did occur in nature, then it would be mathematically equivalentand also much simpler to think of the different types as being different statesof a {\it single} particle, which would be a particle which lived in the directsum of Hilbert spaces associated with the different particle types. In thelanguage of group theory, these are pinor supermultiplets. We discuss thepossible experimental ramifications of this proposal. In particular, followingwork of J. Giesen, we show that the symmetries of the electric dipole moment ofa particle would be definitely affected by this proposal. In fact, we show thatit would be possible to use the electric dipole moment of a particle todetermine the type. We also present an argument that M-theory may provide themechanism which selects a {\it unique} pin bundle.
