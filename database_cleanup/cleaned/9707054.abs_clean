We investigate the dynamics of classical and quantum N-component phi^4oscillators in the presence of an external field. In the large N limit theeffective dynamics is described by two-degree-of-freedom classical Hamiltoniansystems. In the classical model we observe chaotic orbits for any value of theexternal field, while in the quantum case chaos is strongly suppressed. Asimple explanation of this behaviour is found in the change in the structure ofthe orbits induced by quantum corrections. Consistently with Heisenberg'sprinciple, quantum fluctuations are forced away from zero, removing in theeffective quantum dynamics a hyperbolic fixed point that is a major source ofchaos in the classical model.
