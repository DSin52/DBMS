We give the renormalization of the standard model of electroweak interactionsto all orders of perturbation theory by using the method of algebraicrenormalization, which is based on general properties of renormalizedperturbation theory and not on a specific regularization scheme. The Greenfunctions of the standard model are uniquely constructed to all orders, if onedefines the model by the Slavnov-Taylor identity,Ward-identities of rigid symmetry and a specific form of the abelian localgauge Ward-identity, which continues the Gell-Mann Nishijima relation to higherorders. Special attention is directed to the mass diagonalization of masslessand massive neutral vectors and ghosts. For obtaining off-shell infrared finiteexpressions it is required to take into account higher order corrections intothe functional symmetry operators. It is shown, that the normalizationconditions of the on-shell schemes are in agreement with the most generalsymmetry transformations allowed by the algebraic constraints.
