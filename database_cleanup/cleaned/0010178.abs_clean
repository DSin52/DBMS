Matter 2000 (SEWM 2000), Marseille, 14 - 17 June 2000We focus on the massive Thirring model in 1+1 dimensions at finitetemperature and non-zero chemical potential, and comment on some parallelsbetween this model and QCD. In QCD, calculations of physical quantities such astransport coefficients are extremely difficult. In the massive Thirring model,similar calculations are greatly simplified by exploiting the duality whichexists with the sine-Gordon model and its relation, at high temperature, to theexactly solvable classical Coulomb gas on the line.
