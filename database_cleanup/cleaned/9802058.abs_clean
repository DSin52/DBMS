Title: Vertex Algebras, Lie Algebras and Superstrings

Authors: Nils R. Scheithauer

Certain vertex algebras and Lie algebras arising in superstring theory areinvestigated.We show that the Fock space of a compactified Neveu-Schwarz superstring, i.e.a Neveu-Schwarz superstring moving on a torus, carries the structure of avertex superalgebra with a Neveu-Schwarz element. This implies that thephysical states of such a string form a Lie algebra. The same is true for theGSO-projected states. The structure of these Lie algebras is investigated indetail. In particular there is a natural invariant form on them. In case thatthe torus has Lorentzian signature the quotient of these Lie algebras by thekernel of this form is a generalized Kac-Moody algebra. The roots can be easilydescribed. If the dimension of space-time is smaller than or equal to 10 we caneven determine their multiplicities.
