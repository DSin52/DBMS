The Casimir energy or stress due to modes in a D-dimensional volume subjectto TM (mixed) boundary conditions on a bounding spherical surface iscalculated. Both interior and exterior modes are included. Together withearlier results found for scalar modes (TE modes), this gives the Casimireffect for fluctuating ``electromagnetic'' (vector) fields inside and outside aspherical shell. Known results for three dimensions, first found by Boyer, arereproduced. Qualitatively, the results for TM modes are similar to those for(logarithmic singularities) occur for integer dimensions $D\le1$. Particularattention is given the interesting case of D=2.
