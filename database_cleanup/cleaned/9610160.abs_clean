In this work we raise the question whether nonsymmetric gravity and stringtheory are related. We start making the observation, that the gravitationalfield $ g_{\mu\nu}$ and the nonsymmetric gauge field $ A_{\mu\nu}$arising in the low energy limit in the string theory are exactly the same twobasic fields used in four dimensions in nonsymmetric gravity. We argue, thatthis connection between nonsymmetric gravity and string theory at the level ofthe gauge fields $ g_{\mu\nu}$ and $ A_{\mu\nu}$ is not, however,reflected at the level of the corresponding associated actions. In an effort tofind a connection between such an actions we discover a new gravitationalaction, which suggests an alternative version of the bosonic string in whichthe target and the world-volume metrics are unified.
