We construct level-0 modules of the quantum affine algebra $\Uq$, as the$q$-deformed version of the Lie algebra loop module construction. We givenecessary and sufficient conditions for the modules to be irreducible. Weconstruct the crystal base for some of these modules and find significantdifferences from the case of highest weight modules. We also consider the roleof loop modules in the recent scheme for diagonalising certain quantum spinchains using their $\Uq$ symmetry.
