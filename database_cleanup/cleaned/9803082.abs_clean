We calculate the absorption cross section on a black threebrane of two-formperturbations polarized along the brane. The equations are coupled and wedecouple them for s-wave perturbations. The Hawking rate is suppressed at lowenergies, and this is shown to be reflected in the gauge theory by a couplingto a higher dimension operator.
