We discuss fluxes of RR and NSNS background fields in type II stringcompactifications on non-compact Calabi-Yau threefolds together with their dualbrane description which involves bound states of branes. Simultaneously turningon RR and NSNS 2-form fluxes in an 1/2 supersymmetric way can be geometricallydescribed in M-theory by a SL(2,Z) family of metrics of G(2) holonomy. On theother hand, if the flux configuration only preserves 1/4 of supersymmetries, wepostulate the existence of a new eight-dimensional manifold with spin(7)holonomy, which does not seem to fit into the classes of known examples. Thelatter situation is dual to a 1/4 supersymmetric web of branes on the deformedconifold. In addition to the 2-form fluxes, we also present some considerationson type IIA NSNS 4-form and 6-form fluxes.
