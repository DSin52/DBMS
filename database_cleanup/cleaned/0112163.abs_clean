Title: On integrable Hamiltonians for higher spin XXZ chain

Authors: Andrei G. Bytsko

Comments: 20 pages, Latex; Section 8 has been modified

Systems; Strongly Correlated ElectronsIntegrable Hamiltonians for higher spin periodic XXZ chains are constructedin terms of the spin generators; explicit examples for spins up to 3/2 aregiven. Relations between Hamiltonians for some U_q(sl_2)-symmetric andU(1)-symmetric universal r-matrices are studied; their properties areinvestigated. A certain modification of the higher spin periodic chainHamiltonian is shown to be an integrable U_q(sl_2)-symmetric Hamiltonian for anopen chain.
