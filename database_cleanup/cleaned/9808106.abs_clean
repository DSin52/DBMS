Quons are particles characterized by the parameter $q$, which permits smoothinterpolation between Bose and Fermi statistics; $q=1$ gives bosons, $q=-1$gives fermions.In this paper we give a heuristic argument for an extension of conservationof statistics to quons with trilinear couplings of the form $\bar{f}fb$, where$f$ is fermion-like and $b$ is boson-like. We show that $q_f^2=q_b$. Inparticular, we relate the bound on $q_{\gamma}$ for photons to the bound on$q_e$ for electrons, allowing the very precise bound for electrons to becarried over to photons. An extension of this argument suggests that allparticles are fermions or bosons to high precision.
