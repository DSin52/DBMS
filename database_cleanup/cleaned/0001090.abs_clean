It is argued that in certain 2d dilaton gravity theories there existself-consistent solutions of field equations with quantum terms which describeextreme black holes at nonzero temperature. The curvature remains finite on thehorizon due to cancelation of thermal divergencies in the stress-energy tensoragainst divergencies in the classical part of field equations. The extremeblack hole solutions under discussion are due to quantum effects only and donot have classical counterparts.
