We study BPS saturated domain walls in supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Millstheories in the large N limit. We focus on the Seiberg-Witten regime of ${\calN}=2$ theory perturbed by a small mass ($m<O(\Lambda/N^4)$) and determine thewall profile by numerically minimizing its energy density. Similar to the SU(2)wall studied in a previous work, the SU(N) wall has a five layer structure,with two confinement phases on the outside, a Coulomb phase in the middle andtwo transition regions.
