Sets of commuting charges constructed from the current of a U(1) Kac-Moodyalgebra are found. There exists a set S_n of such charges for each positiveinteger n > 1; the corresponding value of the central charge in theFeigin-Fuchs realization of the stress tensor is c = 13-6n-6/n. The charges ineach series can be written in terms of the generators of an exceptionalW-algebra.
