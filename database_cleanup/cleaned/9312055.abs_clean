We present a detailed evaluation of $\eta$, the critical exponentcorresponding to the electron anomalous dimension, at $O(1/N^2_{\!f})$ in alarge flavour expansion of QED in arbitrary dimensions in the Landau gauge. Themethod involves solving the skeleton Dyson equations with dressed propagatorsin the critical region of the theory. Various techniques to compute masslesstwo loop Feynman diagrams, which are of independent interest, are also given.
