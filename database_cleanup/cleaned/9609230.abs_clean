because the duality we proposed before as an application of our method waswrong. The title itself has been changed accordinglyJournal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A12 (1997) 691-696

We point out that the similarities in N = 1 supersymmetric SO, SP gaugetheories can be explained by using the trick of extrapolating the groups to thenegative dimensions. One of the advantages of this trick is that anomalymatching is automatically satisfied.
