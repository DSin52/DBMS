In the present paper we investigate classical dynamics of the Nambu-Gotostring with the Gauss-Bonnet term in the action and point-like masses at theends in the context of effective QCD string. The configurations of rigidlyrotating string is studied and its application to phenomenological descriptionof meson is discussed.
