In this review we present a pedagogical introduction to recent, moremathematical developments in the Skyrme model. Our aim is to render theseadvances accessible to mainstream nuclear and particle physicists. We startwith the static sector and elaborate on geometrical aspects of the definitionof the model. Then we review the instanton method which yields an analyticalapproximation to the minimum energy configuration in any sector of fixed baryonnumber, as well as an approximation to the surfaces which join together all thelow energy critical points. We present some explicit results for B=2. We thendescribe the work done on the multibaryon minima using rational maps, on thetopology of the configuration space and the possible implications of Morsetheory. Next we turn to recent work on the dynamics of Skyrmions. We focusexclusively on the low energy interaction, specifically the gradient flowmethod put forward by Manton. We illustrate the method with some expository toymodels. We end this review with a presentation of our own work on thesemi-classical quantization of nucleon states and low energy nucleon-nucleonscattering.
