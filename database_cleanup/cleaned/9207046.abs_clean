The quantum properties of two-dimensional matter-dilaton gravity---which includes a large family of actions for two-dimensional gravity (inparticular, string-inspired models)--- are investigated. The one-loopdivergences in linear covariant gauges are calculated and the structure of theone-loop renormalization is studied. The explicit forms of the dilatonpotential, dilaton-Maxwell, and dilaton-scalar couplings for which the theoryis one-loop multiplicatively renormalizable are found.A comparison with the one-loop renormalization structure of four-dimensionalgravity-matter theory is given. Charged multiple-horizon black holes whichappear in the model are also considered.
