This model is by its construction close to thestandard cosmological evolution, and it is driven selfconsistently by theevolution of the string equation of state itself. The inflationary StringDriven stage is able to reach enough inflation, describing a Big Bang likeevolution for the metric. By linking this model to a minimal but wellestablished observational information, (the transition times of the differentcosmological epochs), we prove that it gives realistic predictions on early andcurrent energy density and its results are compatible with General Relativity.Interestingly enough, the predicted current energy density is found Omega = 1and a lower limit Omega \geq 4/9 is also found. The energy density at the exitof the inflationary stage also gives | Omega |_{inf}=1. This result shows anagreement with General Relativity (spatially flat metric gives critical energydensity) within an inequivalent Non-Einstenian context (string low energyeffective equations). The order of magnitude of the energy density-dilatoncoupled term at the beginning of the radiation dominated stage agrees with theGUT scale. The predicted graviton spectrum is computed and analyzed without anyfree parameters. Peaks and asymptotic behaviours of the spectrum are a directconsequence of the dilaton involved and not only of the scale factor evolution.increasing spectrum (in no string cosmologies the spectrum is decreasing).Without solving the known problems about higher order corrections and gracefulexit of inflation, we find this model closer to the observational Universe thanthe current available string cosmology scenarii.
