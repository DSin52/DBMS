Radul has recently introduced a map from the Lie algebra of differentialoperators on the circle to $\W_n$. In this note we extend this map to $\Wkpq$,a recently introduced one-parameter deformation of $\Wkp$---the secondhamiltonian structure of the KP hierarchy. We use this to give a short proofthat $\W_\infty$ is the symmetry algebra of additional symmetries of the KPequation. (The replaced version clears up some minor points and corrects somenotational glitches. Get this one!)
