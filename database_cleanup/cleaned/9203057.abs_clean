Considerable interest has recently been expressed in (static sphericallysymmetric) blackholes in interaction with various classical matter fields (suchas electromagnetic fields, dilaton fields, axion fields, Abelian Higgs fields,non--Abelian gauge fields, {\sl etc}). A common feature of these investigationsthat has not previously been remarked upon is that the Hawking temperature ofsuch systems appears to be suppressed relative to that of a vacuum blackhole of\hbar/\sqrt{4\pi A_H}$. This paper will argue that this suppression is generic.Specifically, it will be shown that\[ k T_H = {\hbar\over4\pi r_H} \; e^{-\phi(r_H)} \;\left( 1 - 8\pi G \; \rho_H \; r_H^2 \right). \]Here $\phi(r_H)$ is an integral quantity, depending on the distribution ofmatter, that is guaranteed to be positive if the Weak Energy Condition issatisfied. Several examples of this behaviour will be discussed.Generalizations of this behaviour to non--symmetric non--static blackholesare conjectured.
