It is shown that the inhomogeneous saddle points of scale invariant theoriesmake the semiclassical expansion sensitive on the choice of non-renormalizableoperators. In particular, the instanton fugacity and the beta function of thetwo dimensional non-linear sigma model depends on apparently non-renormalizableoperators. This represents a non-perturbative breakdown of that concept ofuniversality which is based on low dimensional operators.
