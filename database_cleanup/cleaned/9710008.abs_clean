Title: A N-extended version of superalgebras in D=3,9 mod 8

Comments: 13 pages, LaTex file

A set of generalized superalgebras containing arbitrary tensor p-formoperators is considered in dimensions $D=2n+1$ for $n=1,4 mod 4$ and thegeneral conditions for its existence expressed in the form of generalizedJacobi identities is established. These are then solved in a univoque way andsome lowest dimensional cases $ D= 3, 9, 11 $ of possible interest are madeexplicit.
