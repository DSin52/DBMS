Title: Defect Formation Through Boson Condensation in Quantum Field Theory

Authors: Giuseppe Vitiello

Comments: Lectures given at Les-Houches Winter School "Topological Defects and

the Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Symmetry Breaking Phase Transitions",February 16 - 26, 1999Kinks, vortices, monopoles are extended objects, or defects, of quantumorigin with topologically non-trivial properties and macroscopic behavior. Theyare described in Quantum Field Theory in terms of non-homogeneous bosoncondensation. I will review the related QFT formalism, the spontaneousbreakdown of symmetry framework in which the defects appear and discuss finitetemperature effects, also in connection with phase transition problematics.
