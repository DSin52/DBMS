We determine the exact beta function and a RG flow Lyapunov function for N=2SYM with gauge group SU(n). It turns out that the classical discriminantsof the Seiberg-Witten curves determine the RG potential. The radialirreversibility of the RG flow in the SU(2) case and the non-perturbativeidentity relating the $u$-modulus and the superconformal anomaly, indicate theexistence of a four dimensional analogue of the c-theorem for N=2 SYM which weformulate for the full SU(n) theory. Our investigation provides furtherevidence of the essentially topological nature of the theory.
