An accelerating Universe can be accommodated naturally within non-criticalstring theory, in which scattering is described by a superscattering matrix \$that does not factorize as a product of $S$- and $S^\dagger$-matrix elementsand time evolution is described by a modified Liouville equation characteristicof open quantum-mechanical systems. We describe briefly alternativerepresentations in terms of the stochastic Ito and Fokker-Planck equations. Thelink between the vacuum energy and the departure from criticality is stressed.We give an explicit example in which non-marginal \$tring couplings cause adeparture from criticality, and the corresponding cosmological vacuum energyrelaxes to zero \`a la quintessence.
