Theory", June 14-20, 1997, Zakopane, PolandUsing physical arguments (Higgs mechanism, superconductivity, infraredregime, duality) and a geometric-topological construction (scalar curvaturedistribution compatible with surgery), we propose a topological interpretationof 3D SW theory in terms of the abelian Casson invariant. Further algebraicreasoning shows equivalence of that invariant to the Alexander ``polynomial''.Our starting point is a 3D version of the original SW theory. Observing thatthe scalar curvature $R$ plays the role of a mass-squared parameter for themonopole field we can use that observation to control the theory in low-energylimit.
