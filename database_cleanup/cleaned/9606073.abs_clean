The scalars in vector multiplets of N=2 supersymmetric theories in 4dimensions exhibit `special Kaehler geometry', related to duality symmetries,due to their coupling to the vectors. In the literature there is some confusionon the definition of special geometry, which we want to clear up, for rigid aswell as for local N=2.
