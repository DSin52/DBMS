We investigate O(4) textures in a background with a positive cosmologicalconstant. We find static solutions which co-move with the expanding background.There exists a solution in which the scalar field is regular at the horizon.This solution has a noninteger winding number smaller than one. There alsoexist solutions in which scalar-field derivatives are singular at the horizon.Such solutions can complete one winding within the horizon. If the windingnumber is larger than some critical value, static solutions including theregular one are unstable under perturbations.
