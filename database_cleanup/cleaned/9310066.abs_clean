An Ansatz for the Poincar\'e metric on compact Riemann surfaces is proposed.This implies that the Liouville equation reduces to an equation resembling anon chiral analogous of the higher genus relationships (KP equation) arising inthe framework of Schottky's problem solution. This approach connectsuniformization (Fuchsian groups) and moduli space theories with KP hierarchy.Besides its mathematical interest, the Ansatz has some applications in theframework of quantum Riemann surfaces arising in 2D gravity.
