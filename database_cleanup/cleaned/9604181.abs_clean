Two different massive gauge invariant spin-one theories in $3+1$ dimensions,one Stuckelberg formulation and the other `$B^{\wedge}F$' theory, withKalb-Ramond field are shown to be related by duality. This is demonstrated bygauging the global symmetry in the model and constraining the correspondingdual field strength to be zero by a Lagrange multiplier, which becomes a fieldin the dual theory. Implication of this equivalence to the $5$ dimensionaltheories from which these theories can be obtained is discussed. The self-dualDeser-Jackiw model in $2+1$ dimensions, is also shown to result by applyingthis procedure to Maxwell-Chern-Simon theory.
