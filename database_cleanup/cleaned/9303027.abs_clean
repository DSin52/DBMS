Implementing the requirement that a field theory be invariant underSchwinger-Dyson BRST symmetry in the Hamiltonian formalism, we show theequivalence between Hamiltonian and Lagrangian BRST-formalism at the pathintegral level. The Lagrangian quantum master equation is derived as a directconsequence of the Fradkin-Vilkovisky theorem in Hamiltonian BRST quantisation.
