Title: Pulse interaction in nonlinear vacuum electrodynamics

Authors: A. M. Ignatov, V. P. Poponin

The energy-momentum conservation law is used to investigate the interactionof pulses in the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics with Lorentz-invariantconstitutive relations. It is shown that for the pulses of the arbitrary shapethe interaction results in phase shift only.
