In this Ph.D. thesis, we study tachyon condensation in string field theories.In chapter 2, we review Witten's bosonic string field theory and calculatethe tachyon potential.In chapter 3, we calculate the tachyon potential in Berkovits' superstringfield theory.In chapter 4, we look for exact solutions in a toy model.approximation of the tachyon potential in Berkovits' superstring field theory.We verify Sen's conjecture up to 94.4%.
