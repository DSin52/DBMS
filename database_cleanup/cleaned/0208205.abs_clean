Title: Generalised Israel Junction Conditions for a Gauss-Bonnet Brane World

Authors: Stephen C. Davis

Comments: 4 pages

In spacetimes of dimension greater than four it is natural to consider higherorder (in R) corrections to the Einstein equations. In this letter generalizedIsrael junction conditions for a membrane in such a theory are derived. This isachieved by generalising the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term. The junctionconditions are applied to simple brane world models, and are compared to themany contradictory results in the literature.
