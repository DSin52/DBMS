Title: Conservation Laws and Formation of Singularities in Relativistic

Theories of Extended ObjectsComments: 14 pages, LaTeX

The dynamics of an M-dimensional extended object whose M+1 dimensional worldvolume in M+2 dimensional space-time has vanishing mean curvature is formulatedin term of geometrical variables (the first and second fundamental form of thetime-dependent surface $\sum_M$), and simple relations involving the rate ofchange of the total area of $\sum_M$, the enclosed volume as well as thespatial mean -- and intrinsic scalar curvature, integrated over $\sum_M$, arederived. It is shown that the non-linear equations of motion for $\sum_M(t)$can be viewed as consistency conditions of an associated linear system thatgives rise to the existence of non-local conserved quantities (involving theChristoffel-symbols of the flat M+1 dimensional euclidean submanifold swept outin ${\Bbb R}^{M+1}$). For M=1 one can show that all motions are necessarilysingular (the curvature of a closed string in the plane can not be everywhereregular at all times) and for M=2, an explicit solution in terms of ellipticfunctions is exhibited, which is neither rotationally nor axially symmetric. Asa by-product, 3-fold-periodic spacelike maximal hypersurfaces in${\Bbb R}^{1,3}$ are found.
