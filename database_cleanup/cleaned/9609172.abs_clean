We present a new real space renormalization-group map, on the space ofprobabilities, to study the renormalization of the SUSY \phi^4. In our approachwe use the random walk representation on a lattice labeled by an ultrametricspace. Our method can be extended to any \phi^n. New stochastic meaning isgiven to the parameters involved in the flow of the map and results areprovided.
