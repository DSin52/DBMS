Title: Stochastic Quantization of Matrix Models and Field Theory of

Non-Orientable StringsComments: Latex 20 pages, To be published in Proc. 6th Moscow Quantum Gravity

Seminar (Moscow, June 12-17, 1995)In quantizing gravity based on stochastic quantization method, the stochastictime plays a role of the proper time. We study 2D and 4D Euclidean quantumgravity in this context. By applying stochastic quantization method to realsymmetric matrix models, it is shown that the stochastic process defined by theLangevin equation in loop space describes the time evolution of thenon-orientable loops which defines non-orientable 2D surfaces. Thecorresponding Fokker-Planck hamiltonian deduces a non-orientable string fieldtheory at the continuum limit. The strategy, which we have learned in theexample of 2D quantum gravity, is applied to 4D case. Especially, the Langevinequation for the stochastic process of 3-geometries is proposed to describe the(Euclidean) time evolution in 4D quantum gravity with Ashtekar's canonicalvariables. We present it in both lattice regularized version and the naivecontinuum limit.
