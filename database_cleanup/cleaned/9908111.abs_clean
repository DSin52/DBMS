Title: Harmonic scale transformation in effective QFTs with underlying

structuresComments: 11 pages, RevTex, no figure

New equations governing the scale transformation behaviors of a QFT withunderlying structures are derived. These equations, with their severalequivalent versions, can yield some new and significant insights and resultsthat are difficult to see in the conventional renormalization programs. Amongthe several equivalent versions, one is similar to the usual Callan-Symanzikequation and renormalization group equation but with different meanings. Fromanother version, the anomalous equation of energy-momentum tensor trace can beeasily obtained. It can be shown that with the new versions one could partiallyfix the scheme dependence and hence some renormalization schemes like momentumspace subtractions are questionable. The asymptotic freedom for QCD is easilyreproduced at one-loop level in our new version CSE. Finally the decouplingtheorem a la Appelquist and Carazzone are discussed within our strategy.
