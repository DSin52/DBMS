Based upon the formalism of conformal field theory with a boundary, we give adescription of the boundary effect on fully developed two dimensionalturbulence. Exact one and two point velocity correlation functions and energypower spectrum confined in the upper half plane are obtained using the imagemethod. This result enables us to address the infrared problem of the theory ofconformal turbulence.
