We study mass deformations of N=2 superconformal field theories with ADEglobal symmetries on a D3-brane. The N=2 Seiberg-Witten curves with ADEsymmetries are determined by the Type IIB 7-brane backgrounds which are probedby a D3-brane. The Seiberg-Witten differentials $\lambda$ for these ADEtheories are constructed. We show that the poles of $\lambda$ with residues arelocated on the global sections of the bundle in an elliptic fibration. It isthen clearly seen how the residues transform in an irreducible representationof the ADE groups. The explicit form of $\lambda$ depends on the choice of arepresentation of the residues. Nevertheless the physics results are identicalirrespective of the representation of $\lambda$. This is considered as theglobal symmetry version of the universality found in N=2 Yang-Mills theory withlocal ADE gauge symmetries.
