Classical bosonic open string models in fourdimensional Minkowski spacetimeare discussed. A special attention is paid to the choice of edge conditions,which can follow consistently from the action principle. We considerlagrangians that can depend on second order derivatives of worldsheetcoordinates. A revised interpretation of the variational problem for suchtheories is given. We derive a general form of a boundary term that can beadded to the open string action to control edge conditions and modifyconservation laws. An extended boundary problem for minimal surfaces isexamined. Following the treatment of this model in the geometric approach, weobtain that classical open string states correspond to solutions of a complexLiouville equation. In contrast to the Nambu-Goto case, the Liouville potentialis finite and constant at worldsheet boundaries. The phase part of thepotential defines topological sectors of solutions.
