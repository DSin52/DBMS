The non-relativistic quantum field theoretic lagrangian which describes ananyon system in the presence of an electromagnetic field is identified. Anon-minimal magnetic coupling to the Chern-Simons statistical field as well asto the electromagnetic field together with a direct coupling between betweenboth fields are the non-trivial ingredients of the lagrangian obtained from thenon-relativistic limit of the fermionic relativistic formulation. The results,an electromagnetic gyromagnetic ratio 2 for any spin together with anon-trivial dynamical spin dependent contact interaction between anyons as wellas the spin dependence of the electromagnetic effective action, agree with thequantum mechanical formulation.
