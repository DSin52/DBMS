March 10-16, 2002, Strba, SlowakiaWithin the exact renormalisation group approach, it is shown that stabilityproperties of the flow are controlled by the choice for the regulator. Equally,the convergence of the flow is enhanced for specific optimised choices for theregularisation. As an illustration, we exemplify our reasoning for 3d scalartheories at criticality. Implications for other theories are discussed.
