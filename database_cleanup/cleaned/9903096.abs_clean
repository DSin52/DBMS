The interplay between between gauge-field winding numbers, theta-vacua, andthe Dirac operator spectrum in finite-volume gauge theories is reconsidered. Toassess the weight of each topological sector, we compare the mass-dependentchiral condensate in gauge field sectors of fixed topological index with theanswer obtained by summing over the topological charge. Also the microscopicDirac operator spectrum in the full finite-volume Yang-Mills theory is obtainedin this way, by summing over all topological sectors with the appropriateweight.
