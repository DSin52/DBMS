We summarize the results for four-dimensional Bogomol'nyi-Prasad- Sommerfield(BPS) saturated dyonic black hole solutions arising in the Kaluza-Klein sectorand the three-form field sector of the eleven-dimensional supergravity on aseven-torus. These black hole solutions break $3\over 4$ of $N=8$supersymmetry, fill out the multipletes of $U$-duality group, and the twoclasses of solutions are related to each other by a discrete symmetrytransformation in $E_7$. Using the field redefinitions of the correspondingeffective actions, we present these solutions in terms of fields describingclasses of dyonic black holes carrying charges of $U(1)$ gauge fields inNeveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz and/or Ramond-Ramond sector(s) of the type-IIAsuperstring on a six-torus. We also summarize the dependence of their ADMmasses on the asymptotic values of scalar fields, parameterizing the toroidalmoduli space and the string coupling constant.
