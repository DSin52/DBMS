The Bekenstein-Hawking black hole area entropy law suggests that the quantumdegrees of freedom of black holes may be realized as projections of quantumstates unto the event horizon of the black hole. In this paper, we providefurther evidence for this interpretation in the context of string theory. Inparticular, we argue that increase in the quantum entropy due to the capture ofinfalling fundamental strings appears in the form of horizon degrees offreedom.
