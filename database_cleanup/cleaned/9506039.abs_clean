Authors: Stephen Hwang and Henric Rhedin

Comments: 2 pages, Talk presented by H.R. at "STRINGS '95", Los Angeles, March

1995WZNW models, especially gauged WZNW models, are important in the study ofconformal field theories. Karabali and Schnitzer initiated the study of theBRST cohomology of a WZNW model gauged by an anomaly free vector sub-group andresults were given for abelian sub-groups. This result was generalized tonon-abelian sub-groups for a specific set of representations \cite{HR1}. Thesubject of this talk is the analysis of arbitrary representations\cite{HR2,Hw}.
