We show that, the lattice regularization of chiral gauge theories proposed byKaplan, when applied to a (2+1)-dimensional domain wall, produces a(1+1)-dimensional theory at low energy even if gauge anomaly produced by chiralfermions does not cancel. But the corresponding statement is not true in higherdimensions.
