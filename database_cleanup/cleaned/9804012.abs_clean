The first massive level of closed bosonic string theory is studied.Free-field equations are derived by imposing Weyl invariance on the worldsheet. A two-parameter solution to the equation of motion and constraints isfound in two dimensions with a flat linear-dilaton background. One-to-onetachyon scattering is studied in this background. The results support Dhar,Mandal and Wadia's proposal that 2D critical string theory corresponds to thec=1 matrix model in which both sides of the Fermi sea are excited.
