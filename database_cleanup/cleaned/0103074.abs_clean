The noncommutative harmonic oscillator in arbitrary dimension is examined. Itis shown that the $\star$-genvalue problem can be decomposed into separateharmonic oscillator equations for each dimension. The noncommutative plane isinvestigated in greater detail. The constraints for rotationally symmetricsolutions and the corresponding two-dimensional harmonic oscillator are solved.The angular momentum operator is derived and its $\star$-genvalue problem isshown to be equivalent to the usual eigenvalue problem. The $\star$-genvaluesfor the angular momentum are found to depend on the energy difference of theoscillations in each dimension. Furthermore two examples of assymetricnoncommutative harmonic oscillator are analysed. The first is thenoncommutative two-dimensional Landau problem and the second is thethree-dimensional harmonic oscillator with symmetrically noncommutingcoordinates and momenta.
