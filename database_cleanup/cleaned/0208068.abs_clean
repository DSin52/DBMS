By intersecting the RR charged D_p - bar{D}_p pair (p=6, 4, 2, 0) with the RRF7-brane and by intersecting the NSNS charged F1-bar{F1} and NS5-bar{NS5} pairswith the NSNS F6-branes, the possibility of stabilizing the brane-antibranesystems is considered. The behavior of the corresponding supergravity solutionsindicates that the RR F7-brane content of the solution plays the role ofkeeping the brane and the antibrane from annihilating each other completelysince the two-brane configuration structure still persists in the vanishinginter-brane distance limit of the supergravity solution. In terms of thestringy description, we interpret this as representing that the RR F7-brane``delays'' the brane-antibrane annihilation process but only until thisnon-supersymmetric and hence unstable F7-brane itself decays. Then next, thebehavior of the supergravity solutions representing F1-bar{F1} and NS5-bar{NS5}again for vanishing inter-brane separation reveals that as they approach, these``NS''-charged brane and antibrane always collide and annihilate irrespectiveof the presence or the absence of the NSNS F6-brane. And we have essentiallyattributed this to the absence of (open) stringy description of the instabilityin the ``NS''-charged case. This interpretation may provide a resolution to thecontrasting features between the instability of ``R''-charged brane-antibranesystems and that of `NS''-charged ones. Certainly, however, it poses anotherpuzzle that in the ``NS''-charged case, the quantum entity, that should takeover the semi-classical instability as the inter-brane distance gets smaller,is missing. This is rather an embarrassing state of affair that needs to betreated with great care.
