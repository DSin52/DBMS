The ``position'' and ``momentum'' operators for the q-deformed oscillatorwith q being a root of unity are proved to have discrete eigenvalues which areroots of deformed Hermite polynomials. The Fourier transform connecting the``position'' and ``momentum'' representations is also foundThe phase space of this oscillator has a lattice structure, which is anon-uniformly distributed grid. Non-equidistant lattice structures also occurin the cases of the truncated harmonic oscillator and of the q-deformedparafermionic oscillator, while the parafermionic oscillator corresponds to auniformly distributed grid.
