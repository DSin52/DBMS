Title: New supersymetries for spinning particles and black holes

Authors: J.W. van Holten

Comments: 13 pages, Lecture at the workshop on Constraint Theory and

Quantization Methods, Montepulciano (It) june/july 1993, NIKHEF-H/93-25The usual extensions of supersymmetry require the existence of a complexstructure and the formulation of the theory on K\"{a}hler manifolds. It isshown, that by relaxing the constraints on the algebra of supercharges we canget new supersymmetries whenever a manifold possesses a structure admitting theexistence of a Killing-Yano tensor field. Examples of such manifolds are theKerr-Newman space-times describing spinning black holes in four dimensions.
