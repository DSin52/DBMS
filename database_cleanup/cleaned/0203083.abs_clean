We propose that the entropy of de Sitter space can be identified with themutual entropy of a dual conformal field theory. We argue that unitary timeevolution in de Sitter space restricts the total number of excited degrees offreedom to be bounded by the de Sitter entropy, and we give a CFTinterpretation of this restriction. We also clarify issues arising from thefact that both de Sitter and anti de Sitter have dual descriptions in terms ofconformal field theory.
