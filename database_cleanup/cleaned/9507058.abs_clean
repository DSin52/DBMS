The natural relativistic generalisation of Landau's two constituentsuperfluid theory can be formulated in terms of a Lagrangian $L$ that is givenas a function of the entropy current 4-vector $s^\rho$ and the gradient$\nabla\varphi$ of the superfluid phase scalar. It is shown that in the ``cool"regime, for which the entropy is attributable just to phonons (not rotons), theLagrangian function $L(\vec s, \nabla\varphi)$ is given by an expression of theform $L=P-3\psi$ where $P$ represents the pressure as a function just of$\nabla\varphi$ in the (isotropic) cold limit. The entropy current dependentcontribution $\psi$ represents the generalised pressure of the (non-isotropic)phonon gas, which is obtained as the negative of the corresponding grandpotential energy per unit volume, whose explicit form has a simple algebraicdependence on the sound or ``phonon" speed $c_P$ that is determined by the coldpressure function $P$.
