We study four point correlation functions of the spin 1 operators in theSU(2)_0 WZNW model. The general solution which is everywhere single-valued haslogarithmic terms and thus has a natural interpretation in terms of logarithmicconformal field theory. These are not invariant under all the crossingsymmetries but can remain if fields possess additional quantum numbers.
