We present regular solutions for a brane world scenario in the form of a 'tHooft-Polyakov monopole living in the three-dimensional spherical symmetrictransverse space of a seven-dimensional spacetime. In contrast to the cases ofa domain-wall in five dimensions and a string in six dimensions, there existgravity-localizing solutions for both signs of the bulk cosmological constant.A detailed discussion of the parameter space that leads to localization ofgravity is given. A point-like monopole limit is discussed.
