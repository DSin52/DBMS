The basicproperties of p-adic numbers, of their algebraic extensions and the so calledcanonical identification between positive real numbers and p-adic numbers aredescribed. Canonical identification induces p-adic topology and differentiablestructure on real axis and allows definition of definite integral withphysically desired properties. p-Adic numbers together with canonicalidentification provide analytic tool to produce fractals. Canonicalidentification makes it possible to generalize probability concept, Hilbertspace concept, Riemannian metric and Lie groups to p-adic context. Conformalinvariance generalizes to arbitrary dimensions since p-adic numbers allowalgebraic extensions of arbitrary dimension. The central theme of alldevelopments is the existence of square root, which forces unique algebraicextension with dimension $D=4$ and $D=8$ for $p>2$ and $p=2$ respectively. Thisin turn implies that the dimensions of p-adic Riemann spaces are multiples of$4$ in $p>2$ case and of $8$ in $p=2$ case.
