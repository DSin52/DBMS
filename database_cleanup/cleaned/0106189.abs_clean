We discuss the issue of the cosmological constant in non-commutativenon-supersymmetric gauge theories. In particular, in orbifold field theoriesnon-commutativity acts as a UV cut-off. We suggest that in these theoriesquantum corrections give rise to a vacuum energy \rho, that is controlled bythe non-commutativity parameter \theta, \rho ~ 1/theta^2 (only a softlogarithmic dependence on the Planck scale survives). We demonstrate our claimin a two-loop computation in field theory and by certain higher loop examples.Based on general expressions from string theory, we suggest that the vacuumenergy is controlled by non-commutativity to all orders in perturbation theory.
