We point out that the celebrated Hawking effect of quantum instability ofblack holes seems to be related to a nonperturbative effect in string theory.Studying quantum dynamics of strings in the gravitational background of blackholes we find classical instability due to emission of massless stringexcitations. The topology of a black hole seems to play a fundamental role indeveloping the string theory classical instability due to the effect of sigmamodel instantons. We argue that string theory allows for a qualitativedescription of black holes with very small masses and it predicts topologicalsolitons with quantized spectrum of masses. These solitons would not decay intostring massless excitations but could be pair created and may annihilate also.Semiclassical mass quantization of topological solitons in string theory isbased on the argument showing existence of nontrivial zeros of beta function ofthe renormalization group.
