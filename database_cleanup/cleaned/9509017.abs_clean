Exact Superstring solutions are constructed moving in 4-D space-time withpositive curvature and non-trivial dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields. Thefull spectrum of string excitations is derived as a function of moduli fields$T^{i}$ and the scale $\mu^2=1/(k+2)$ which induced by the non-zero backgroundfields. The spectrum of string excitations has a non-zero mass gap $\mu^2$ andin the weak curvature limit ($\mu$ small) $\mu^2$ plays the role of a welldefined infrared regulator, consistent with modular invariance, gaugeinvariance, supersymmetry and chirality.The effects of a covariantly constant chomo-magnetic field $B$ as well asadditional curvature can be derived exactly up to one string-loop level. Thus,the one-loop corrections to all couplings (gravitational, gauge and Yukawas)are unambiguously computed and are finite both in the Ultra-Violet and theInfra-Red regime. These corrections are necessary for quantitative stringsuperunification predictions at low energies. Similar calculations are done inthe effective field theory. The one-loop corrections to the couplings are alsofound to satisfy Infrared Flow Equations.
