Title: Comments on Neveu-Schwarz Five-Branes

Authors: Nathan Seiberg and Savdeep Sethi

Comments: 14 pages

We study the theory of NS five-branes in string theory with a smoothnon-trivial transverse space. We show that in the limit that the bulk physicsdecouples, these theories become equivalent to theories with a flat andnon-compact transverse space. We present a matrix model description of the typeIIA theory on $\IR^9\times S^1$ with NS five-branes located at points on thecircle. Consequently, we obtain a description of the dual configuration ofKaluza-Klein monopoles in the type IIB theory.
