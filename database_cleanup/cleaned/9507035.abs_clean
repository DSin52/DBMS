Quantum fluctuations in the background geometry of a black hole are shown toaffect the propagation of matter states falling into the black hole in afoliation that corresponds to observations purely outside the horizon. A statethat starts as a Minkowski vacuum at past null infinity gets entangled with thegravity sector, so that close to the horizon it can be represented by astatistical ensemble of orthogonal states. We construct an operator connectingthe different states and comment on the possible physical meaning of the aboveconstruction. The induced energy-momentum tensor of these states is computed inthe neighbourhood of the horizon, and it is found that energy-momentumfluctuations become large in the region where the bulk of the Hawking radiationis produced. The background spacetime as seen by an outside observer may bedrastically altered in this region, and an outside observer should seesignificant interactions between the infalling matter and the outgoing Hawkingradiation. The boundary of the region of strong quantum gravitational effectsis given by a time-like hypersurface of constant Schwarzschild radius $r$ onePlanck unit away from the horizon. This boundary hypersurface is an example ofa stretched horizon.
