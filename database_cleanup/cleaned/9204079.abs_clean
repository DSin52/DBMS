The cosmology of the string effective action, including one loop stringthreshold corrections, is analyzed for static compactifications. The stabilityof the minima of a general supersymmetry breaking potential is studied in thepresence of radiation. In particular, it is shown that the radiation bath makesthe minima with negative cosmological constant unstable.
