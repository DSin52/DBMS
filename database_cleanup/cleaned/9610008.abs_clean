We find an analog of the electric-magnetic duality, which is a $Z_2$transformation between magnetic and electric sectors of the static androtationally symmetric solutions in a class of (2+1)-dimensionalEinstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity theories. The theories in our considerationinclude, in particular, one parameter class of theories continuously connectingthe Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) gravity and the low energy stringeffective theory. When there is no $U(1)$ charge, we have $O(2)$ or $O(1,1)$symmetry, depending on a parameter that specifies each theory. Via the $Z_2$transformation, we obtain exact magnetically charged solutions from the knownelectrically charged solutions. We explain the relationship between the $Z_2$transformation and $O(2,Z)$ symmetry, and comment on the $T$-duality of thestring theory.
