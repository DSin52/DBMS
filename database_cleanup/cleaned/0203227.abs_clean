Neveu-Schwarz ghost slivers in pictures zero and minus one are constructed.In particular, using algebraic methods $\beta$, $\gamma$ ghost sliver in the -1picture is obtained. The algebraic method consists in solving a projectorequation in an algebra, where the multiplication is defined by a pure 3-stringvertex without any insertions at the string midpoint. We show that thisprojector is a sliver in a twisted version of $\beta$, $\gamma$ conformaltheory. We also show that the product of the twisted $b$, $c$ and $\beta$,$\gamma$ ghost slivers solves an equation that appears after a specialrescaling of super VSFT.
