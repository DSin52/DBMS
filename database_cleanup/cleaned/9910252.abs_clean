We construct the complete and explicit non-linear Kaluza-Klein Ansatz forderiving the bosonic sector of the standard N=4 SO(4) gauged four-dimensionalsupergravity from the reduction of D=11 supergravity on S^7. This provides away of interpreting all bosonic solutions of the four-dimensional gauged theoryas exact solutions in eleven-dimensional supergravity. We discuss certainlimiting forms of the Kaluza-Klein reduction, and compare them with relatedforms in the Freedman-Schwarz N=4 SU(2)xSU(2) gauged theory. This leads us tothe result that the Freedman-Schwarz model is in fact a singular limiting caseof the standard SO(4) gauged supergravity. We show that in this limit, ourAnsatz for getting the SO(4) gauged theory as an S^7 reduction from D=11 indeedreduces to an S^3 x S^3 reduction from D=10, which makes contact with previousresults in the literature. We also show that there is no distinction to be madebetween having equal or unequal values for the gauge coupling constants $g$ and$\tilde g$ of the two SU(2) gauge-group factors in the standard N=4 SO(4)gauged supergravity, whilst by contrast the ratio of $g$ to $\tilde g$ is anon-trivial parameter of the Freedman-Schwarz model.
