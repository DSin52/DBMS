As a further test of the conjectured equivalence of string states andextremal black holes, we compute the dipole moments of black holes witharbitrary spin and superspin in D=4,N=4 supergravity coupled to 22 vectormultiplets and compare them with the dipole moments of states in the heteroticstring on $T^6$ or the Type IIA string on $K3 \times T^2$. Starting from apurely bosonic black hole with Kerr angular momentum L, the superpartners aregenerated by acting with fermion zero modes, thus filling out the completesupermultiplet. $L$ is then identified with the superspin. On the heteroticside, elementary states belong only to short to long multiplets, but Type IIAelementary states can belong to intermediate multiplets as well. We find thatthe black hole gyromagnetic ratios are in perfect agreement with the stringstates not only for the BPS states belonging to short multiplets but also forthose belonging to intermediate multiplets. In fact, these intermediatemultiplets provide a stronger test of the black-hole/string-state equivalencebecause the gyromagnetic ratios are not determined by supersymmetry alone, incontrast to those of the short multiplets. We even find agreement between thenon-supersymmetric (but still extremal) black holes and non-BPS string statesbelonging to long supermultiplets. In addition to magnetic dipole moments wealso find electric dipole moments even for purely electrically charged blackholes. The electric dipole moments of the corresponding string states have notyet been calculated directly but are consistent with heterotic/Type IIAduality.
