Authors: J. L. Tomazelli and L. C. Costa

Comments: LaTex file, 13 pages, no figures

The aim of this work is to investigate the role played by the fermion massand that of an external field on the fermionic Casimir energy density under S^1X R^3 topology. Both twisted and untwisted spin connections are considered andthe exact calculation is performed using a somewhat different approach based onthe combination of the analytic regularization method throughalpha-representation and Euler-Maclaurin summation formula.
