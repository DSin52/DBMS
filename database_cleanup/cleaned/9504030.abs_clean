Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B354 (1995) 307-314

We obtain the conserved, nonlocal charges for the supersymmetric two bosonhierarchy from fractional powers of its Lax operator. We show that thesecharges reduce to the ones of the supersymmetric KdV system under appropriatereduction. We study the algebra of the nonlocal, local and supersymmetrycharges with respect to the first and the second Hamiltonian structures of thesystem and discuss how they close as a graded nonlinear cubic algebra.
