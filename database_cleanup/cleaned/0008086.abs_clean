Title: Dirac Spectrum in Adjoint QCD

Comments: Invited talk at the "Fourth Workshop on Continuous Advances in QCD",

Minneapolis, May 12-14, 2000, 15 pages, Latex, 1 figureIn this lecture we discuss some exact results for the low-lying spectrum ofthe Dirac operator in adjoint QCD. In particular, we find an analyticalexpression for the slope of the average spectral density. These results areobtained by means of a generating function which is an extension of the QCDpartition function with fermionic and bosonic ghost quarks. The low-energylimit of this generating function is completely determined by chiral(super-)symmetries. Our results for the slope of the average spectral densityare consistent with the results for the scalar susceptibility which can beobtained from the usual chiral Lagrangian.
