In this paper I continue the study of the new framework of modularlocalization and its constructive use in the nonperturbative d=1+1Karowski-Weisz-Smirnov formfactor program. Particular attention is focussed onthe existence of semilocal generators of the wedge-localized algebra withoutvauum polarization (FWG-operators) which are closely related to objectsfulfilling the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebraic structure. They generate a``thermal Hilbert space'' and allow to understand the equivalence of the KMSconditions with the so-called cyclicity equation for formfactors which wasknown to be closely related to crossing symmetry properties. The modularsetting gives rise to interesting new ideas on ``free'' d=2+1 anyons andplektons.
