Title: Current-Current Deformations of Conformal Field Theories, and WZW Models

Authors: Stefan Forste and Daniel Roggenkamp

Comments: 30 pages, latex

Moduli spaces of conformal field theories corresponding to current-currentdeformations are discussed. For WZW models, CFT and sigma model considerationsare compared. It is shown that current-current deformed WZW models haveWZW-like sigma model descriptions with non-bi-invariant metrics, additionalB-fields and a non-trivial dilaton.
