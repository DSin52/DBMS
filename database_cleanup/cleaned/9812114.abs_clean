We study the boundary limit of the bulk isometries of AdS x S. Thesuperconformal symmetry is realized on the coordinates of the AdS boundary, thefermionic superspace coordinates, and the harmonics on the sphere. We show howthese may be related to the coordinates of an off-shell harmonic superspace ofSCFT living on the boundary. In the special case of d=4, N=2 super Yang-Millstheory, a truncation of the N=4 SYM dual to Type IIB string theory compactifiedon AdS_5 x S^5, we identify the bosonic space SU(2)/U(1) of the N=2 harmonicsuperspace (known before as auxiliary) with the S^2 submanifold of the S^5.
