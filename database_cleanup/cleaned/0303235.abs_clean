We study exclusive scattering of `hadrons' at high energy and fixed angle in(nonconformal) noncommutative gauge theories. Via gauge-string duality, we showthat the noncommutativity renders the scattering soft, leading to exponentialsuppression. The result fits with the picture that, in noncommutative gaugetheory, fundamental parton contents constitute wee-partons only and `hadrons'are made out of open Wilson lines.
