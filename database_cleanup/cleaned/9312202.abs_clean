Using the variational formula for operator product coefficients a method forperturbative calculation of the short-distance expansion of the Spin-Spincorrelation function in the two dimensional Ising model is presented. Resultsof explicit calculation up to third order agree with known results from thescaling limit of the lattice calculation.
