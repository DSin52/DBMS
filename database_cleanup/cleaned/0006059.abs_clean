We consider a recent proposal to solve the cosmological constant problemwithin the context of brane world scenarios with infinite volume extradimensions. In such theories bulk can be supersymmetric even if branesupersymmetry is completely broken. The bulk cosmological constant cantherefore naturally be zero. Since the volume of the extra dimensions isinfinite, it might appear that at large distances one would measure the bulkcosmological constant which vanishes. We point out a caveat in this argument.In particular, we use a concrete model, which is a generalization of theDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model, to argue that in the presence of non-zero branecosmological constant at large distances such a theory might become effectivelyfour dimensional. This is due to a mass gap in the spectrum of bulk gravitonmodes. In fact, the corresponding distance scale is set precisely by the branecosmological constant. This phenomenon appears to be responsible for the factthat bulk supersymmetry does not actually protect the brane cosmologicalconstant.
