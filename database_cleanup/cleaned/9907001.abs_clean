We present a short and direct derivation of Hawking radiation as a tunnelingprocess, based on particles in a dynamical geometry. The imaginary part of theaction for the classically forbidden process is related to the Boltzmann factorfor emission at the Hawking temperature. Because the derivation respectsconservation laws, the exact spectrum is not precisely thermal. We compare andcontrast the problem of spontaneous emission of charged particles from acharged conductor.
