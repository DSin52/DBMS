In this paper we formulate a general method for building completelyintegrable quantum systems. The method is based on the use of the so-calledmulti-parameter spectral equations, i.e. equations with several spectralparameters. We show that any such equation, after eliminating some spectralparameters by means of the so-called inverse procedure of separation ofvariables can be reduced to a certain completely integrable model. Startingwith exactly or quasi-exactly solvable multi-parameter spectral equations we,respectively, obtain exactly or quasi-exactly solvable integrable models.
