We construct a covariant bound on the energy-momentum of the M-fivebranewhich is saturated by all supersymmetric configurations. This leads to ageneralised notion of a calibrated geometry for M-fivebranes when theworldvolume gauge field is non-zero. The generalisation relevant for Dp-branesis also given.
