We study the long wavelength limit of a spin S Heisenberg antiferromagneticchain. The fermionic Lagrangian obtained corresponds to a perturbed level 2SSU(2) Wess-Zumino-Witten model. This effective theory is then mapped into acompact U(1) boson interacting with Z_{2S} parafermions. The analysis of thiseffective theory allows us to show that when S is an integer there is a massgap to all excitations, whereas this gap vanishes in the half-odd-integer spincase. This gives a field theory treatment of the so-called Haldane's conjecturefor arbitrary values of the spin S.
