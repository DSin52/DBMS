Differential regularization is used to investigate the one-loop quantumcorrections to Chern-Simons-Maxwell spinor and scalar electrodynamics. Weillustrate the techniques to write the loop amplitudes in coordinate space. Theshort-distance expansion method is developed to perform the Fouriertransformation of the amplitudes into momentum space and the possiblerenormalization ambiguity in Chern-Simons type gauge theories in terms ofdifferential regularization is discussed. We also stress that the surface termsappearing in the differential regularization should be kept along for finitetheories and they will result in the finite renormalization ambiguity.
