We study the black hole information paradox in the context of atwo-dimensional toy model given by dilaton gravity coupled to $N$ masslessscalar fields. After making the model well-defined by imposing reflectingboundary conditions at a critical value of the dilaton field, we quantize thetheory and derive the quantum quantum $S$-matrix for the case that $N$=$24$.This $S$-matrix is unitary by construction, and we further argue that in thesemiclassical regime it describes the formation and subsequent Hawkingevaporation of two-dimensional black holes. Finally, we note an interestingcorrespondence between the dilaton gravity $S$-matrix and that of the $c=1$matrix model.
