EffectWe identify the impurity interactions of the recently proposed CFTdescription of a bilayer Quantum Hall system at filling nu =m/(pm+2) in Mod.Phys. Lett. A 15 (2000) 1679. Such a CFT is obtained by m-reduction on the onelayer system, with a resulting pairing symmetry and presence of quasi-holes.For the m=2 case boundary terms are shown to describe an impurity interactionwhich allows for a localized tunnel of the Kondo problem type. The presence ofan anomalous fixed point is evidenced at finite coupling which is unstable withrespect to unbalance and flows to a vacuum state with no quasi-holes.
