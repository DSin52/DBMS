Title: Fractal Statistics and Quantum Black Hole Entropy

Authors: Wellington da Cruz

Comments: latex, 6 pages, remark added

Simple considerations about the fractal characteristic of thequantum-mechanical path give us the opportunity to derive the quantum blackhole entropy in connection with the concept of fractal statistics. We show thegeometrical origin of the numerical factor of four of the quantum black holeentropy expression and the statistics weight appears as a counting of thequanta of geometry.
