The potential of a configuration of two Dirichlet branes for which the numberof ND-directions is eight is determined. Depending on whether one of the branesis an anti-brane or a brane, the potential vanishes or is twice as large as thedilaton-gravitational potential. This is shown to be related to the fact that afundamental string is created when two such branes cross. Special emphasis isgiven to the D0-D8 system, for which an interpretation of these results interms of the massive IIA supergravity is presented. It is also shown that thebranes cannot move non-adiabatically in the transverse direction. Theconfiguration of a zero brane and an orientifold 8-plane is analyzed in asimilar way, and some implications for the type IA-heterotic duality and theheterotic matrix theory are discussed.
