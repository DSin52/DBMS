We study the infra-red limit of the O(N) gauge theory that describes the lowenergy modes of a system of $N$ type I D-strings and provide some support tothe conjecture that, in this limit, the theory flows to an orbifold conformaltheory. We compute the elliptic genus of the orbifold theory and argue that itslongest string sector describes the bound states of D-strings. We show that, asa result, the masses and multiplicities of the bound states are in agreementwith the predictions of heterotic-type I duality in 9 dimensions, for all theBPS charges in the lattice $\Gamma_{(1,17)}$.
