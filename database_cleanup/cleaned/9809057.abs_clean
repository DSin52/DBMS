In this article old and new relations between gauge fields and strings arediscussed. We add new arguments that the Yang Mills theories must be describedby the non-critical strings in the five dimensional curved space. The physicalmeaning of the fifth dimension is that of the renormalization scale representedby the Liouville field. We analyze the meaning of the zigzag symmetry and showthat it is likely to be present if there is a minimal supersymmetry on theworld sheet. We also present the new string backgrounds which may be relevantfor the description of the ordinary bosonic Yang-Mills theories. The article iswritten on the occasion of the 40-th anniversary of the IHES.
