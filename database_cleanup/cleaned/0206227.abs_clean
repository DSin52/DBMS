Title: Phases of bosonic strings and two dimensional gauge theories

Authors: Antti J. Niemi

We suggest that the extrinsic curvature and torsion of a bosonic string canbe employed as variables in a two dimensional Landau-Ginzburg gauge fieldtheory. Their interpretation in terms of the abelian Higgs multiplet leads totwo different phases. In the phase with unbroken gauge symmetry the groundstate describes open strings while in the phase with broken gauge symmetry theground state involves closed strings. When we allow for an additional abeliangauge structure along the string, we arrive at an interpretation in terms ofthe two dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory.
