Title: Nonperturbative effects in deformation quantization

Authors: Vipul Periwal

Comments: 4 pages, RevTeX

The Cattaneo-Felder path integral form of the perturbative Kontsevichdeformation quantization formula is used to explicitly demonstrate theexistence of nonperturbative corrections to na\"\i ve deformation quantization.
