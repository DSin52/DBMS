Title: Proton Decay in Intersecting D-brane Models

Comments: 21 pages, LaTeX; v2

We analyze proton decay via dimension six operators in certain GUT-likemodels derived from Type IIA orientifolds with $D6$-branes. The amplitude isparametrically enhanced by a factor of $\alpha_{GUT}^{-1/3}$ relative to thecoresponding result in four-dimensional GUT's. Nonetheless, even assuming aplausible enhancement from the threshold corrections, we find little overallenhancement of the proton decay rate from dimension six operators, so that thepredicted lifetime from this mechanism remains close to $10^{36}$ years.
