It is confirmed that geodesic string junctions are necessary to describe thegauge vectors of symmetry groups that arise in the context of IIB superstringscompactified in the presence of nonlocal 7-branes. By examining the modulispace of 7-brane backgrounds for which the dilaton and axion fields areconstant, we are able to describe explicitly and geometrically how open stringgeodesics can fail to be smooth, and how geodesic string junctions then becomethe relevant BPS representatives of the gauge bosons. The mechanisms thatguarantee the existence and uniqueness of the BPS representative of any gaugevector are also shown to generalize to the case where the dilaton and axionfields are not constant.
