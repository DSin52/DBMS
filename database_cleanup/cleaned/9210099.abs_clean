We construct the supersymmetric completion of quartic $R+R^4$-actions in theten-dimensional effective action of the heterotic string. Two invariants, ofwhich the bosonic parts are known from one-loop string amplitude calculations,are obtained. One of these invariants can be generalized to an$R+F^2+F^4$-invariant for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory coupled tosupergravity.Supersymmetry requires the presence of $B\wedge R\wedge R\wedgeR\wedge R$-terms, ($B\wedge F\wedge F\wedge F\wedge F$ forYang-Mills) which correspond to counterterms in the Green-Schwarz anomalycancellation. Within the context of our calculation the $\zeta(3)R^4$-term fromthe tree-level string effective action does not allow supersymmetrization.
