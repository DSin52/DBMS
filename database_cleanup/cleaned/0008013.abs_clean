Using the construction of D-branes with nonzero $B$ field in the matrix modelwe give a physical interpretation of the known background independence in gaugetheories on a noncommutative space. The background independent variables areidentified as the degrees of freedom of the underlying matrix model. Thisclarifies and extends some recent results about the end point of tachyoncondensation in D-branes with a $B$ field. We also explain the freedom in thedescription which is parametrized by a two form $\Phi$ from the points of viewof the noncommutative geometry on the worldvolume of the branes, and of thefirst quantized string theory.
