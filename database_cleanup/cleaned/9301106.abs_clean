The structure of one-loop divergences of two-dimensional dilaton-Maxwelleffective action and the other a unique effective action. The one-loopdivergences (including surface divergences) of the convenient effective action$\Omega$-degenerate De Witt, and (iii) simplest covariant. The on-shelleffective action is given by surface divergences only (finiteness of the$S$-matrix), which yet depend upon the gauge condition choice.Off-shell renormalizability is discussed and classes of renormalizabledilaton and Maxwell potentials are found which coincide in the cases ofconvenient and unique effective actions. A detailed comparison of bothsituations, i.e. convenient vs. unique effective action, is given. As anextension of the procedure, the one-loop effective action in two-dimensionaldilaton-Yang-Mills gravity is calculated.
