Title: Accelerated Electrons and the Unruh Effect

Authors: Jon Magne Leinaas

Quantum effects for electrons in a storage ring are studied in a co-moving,accelerated frame. The polarization effect due to spin flip synchrotronradiation is examined by treating the electron as a simple quantum mechanicaltwo-level system coupled to the orbital motion and to the radiation field. Theexcitations of the spin system are related to the Unruh effect, i.e. the effectthat an accelerated radiation detector is thermally excited by vacuumfluctuations. The importance of orbital fluctuations is pointed out and thevertical fluctuations are examined.
