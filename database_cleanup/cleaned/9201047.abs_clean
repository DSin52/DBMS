The duality-invariant gaugino condensation with or without massive matterfields is re-analysed, taking into account the dependence of the stringthreshold corrections on the moduli fields and recent results concerningone-loop corrected K\"ahler potentials. The scalar potential of the theory fora generic superpotential is also calculated.
