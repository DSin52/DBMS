We present a simple form of the Type IIB string action on $AdS_5\times S^5$.The result is achieved by fixing $\kappa$-symmetry in the Killing spinor gaugedefined by the projector of the Killing spinor of the D3 brane. We showexplicitly that in this gauge the superspace is greatly simplified which is thecrucial ingredient for the simple string action.
