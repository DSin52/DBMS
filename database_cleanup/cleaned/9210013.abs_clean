The vacuum energy is calculated for a free, conformally-coupled scalar fieldon the orbifold space-time \R$\times \S^2/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is afinite subgroup of O(3) acting with fixed points. The energy vanishes when$\Gamma$ is composed of pure rotations but not otherwise. It is shown ongeneral grounds that the same conclusion holds for all even-dimensionalfactored spheres and the vacuum energies are given as generalised Bernoullifunctions (i.e. Todd polynomials). The relevant $\zeta$- functions are analysedin some detail and several identities are incidentally derived. The generaldiscussion is presented in terms of finite reflection groups.
