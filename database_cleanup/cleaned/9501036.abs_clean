We derive the $t{\bar t}$-equations for generic $N\!=\!2$ topological fieldtheories as consistency conditions for the contact term algebra of topologicalstrings. A generalization of the holomorphic anomaly equation, known for thecritical ${\hat c}\!=\!3$ case, to arbitrary non critical topological stringsis presented. The interplay between the non trivial cohomology of the$b$-antighost, gravitational descendants and $\bar t$-dependence is discussed.The physical picture emerging from this study is that the $\bar t$ (background)dependence of topological strings with non trivial cohomology for the$b$-antighost, is determined by gravitational descendants.
