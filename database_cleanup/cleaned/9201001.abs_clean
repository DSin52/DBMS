We study algebraic aspects of Kontsevich integralsas generating functions for intersection theory over moduli spaceand review the derivation of Virasoro and KdV constraints.1. Intersection numbers2. The Kontsevich integral2.1. The main theorem2.2 Expansion of Z on characters and Schur functions2.3 Proof of the first part of the Theorem3. From Grassmannians to KdV4. Matrix Airy equation and Virasoro highest weight conditions5. Genus expansion6. Singular behaviour and Painlev'e equation.7. Generalization to higher degree potentials
