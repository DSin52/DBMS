We calculate the emission and absorption rates of fixed scalars by thenear-extremal five-dimensional black holes that have recently been modeledusing intersecting D-branes. We find agreement between the semi-classical andD-brane computations. At low energies the fixed scalar absorption cross-sectionis smaller than for ordinary scalars and depends on other properties of theblack hole than just the horizon area. In the D-brane description, fixed scalarabsorption is suppressed because these scalars must split into at least four,rather than two, open strings running along the D-brane. Consequently, thiscomparison provides a more sensitive test of the effective string picture ofthe D-brane bound state than does the cross-section for ordinary scalars. Inparticular, it allows us to read off the value of the effective string tension.That value is precisely what is needed to reproduce the near-extremal 5-braneentropy.
