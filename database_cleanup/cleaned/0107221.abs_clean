A renormalization group flow equation with a scale-dependent transformationof field variables gives a unified description of fundamental and compositedegrees of freedom. In the context of the effective average action, we studythe renormalization flow of scalar bound states which are formed out offundamental fermions. We use the gauged Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model at weak gaugecoupling as an example. Thereby, the notions of bound state or fundamentalparticle become scale dependent, being classified by the fixed-point structureof the flow of effective couplings.
