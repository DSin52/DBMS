The continuous extension of the discrete duality symmetry of the Schwarz-Senmodel is studied. The corresponding infinitesimal generator $Q$ turns out to belocal, gauge invariant and metric independent. Furthermore, $Q$ commutes withall the conformal group generators. We also show that $Q$ is equivalent to thenon---local duality transformation generator found in the Hamiltonianformulation of Maxwell theory. We next consider the Batalin--Fradkin-Vilkoviskyformalism for the Maxwell theory and demonstrate that requiring a local dualitytransformation lead us to the Schwarz--Sen formulation. The partition functionsare shown to be the same which implies the quantum equivalence of the twoapproaches.
