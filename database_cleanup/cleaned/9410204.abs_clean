Title: Functional determinants and effective actions

Authors: J.S.Dowker and J.S.Apps

Comments: 3 pages, uses JyTeX

Some calculational errors in expressions derived previously by the firstauthor for the effective action, or equivalently for the functionaldeterminant, on sectors of a spherical cap are corrected. The formula for thechange in the effective action under Weyl rescalings in the three dimensionalcase is also amended.
