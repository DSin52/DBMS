Authors: H.G. Kausch

Comments: 5 pages LaTeX, Imperial/TH/91-92/38

It is argued that chiral algebras of conformal field theory possess aW-algebra structure. A survey of explicitly known W-algebras and theirconstructions is given. (Talk given at the XIX International Colloquium on``Group Theoretical Methods in Physics'', Salamanca, Spain, June 29 -- July 4,1992)
