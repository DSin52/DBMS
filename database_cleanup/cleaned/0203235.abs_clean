Title: Holographic Inflation

Comments: 19 pages in phyzzx.tex

Using the de Sitter/CFT correspondence we describe a scenario of holographicinflation which is driven by a three dimensional boundary field theory. We findthat inflationary constraints severely restrict the $\beta$--function, theanomalous dimensions and the value of the $C$--function of the boundary theory.The scenario has model independent predictions such as $\epsilon<< \eta$,$n_T<0.04$, $P_{tensor}/P_{scalar}<0.08$ and $H<10^{14} GeV$. We consider somesimple boundary theories and find that they do not lead to inflation. Thus,building an acceptable holographic inflation model remains a challenge. We alsodescribe holographic quintessence and find that it closely resembles acosmological constant.
