Mass and other conserved Noether charges are discussed for solutions ofgravity theories with locally Anti-de Sitter asymptotics in 2n dimensions. Theaction is supplemented with a boundary term whose purpose is to guarantee thatit reaches an extremum on the classical solutions, provided the spacetime islocally AdS at the boundary. It is also shown that if spacetime is locally AdSat spatial infinity, the conserved charges are finite and properly normalizedwithout requiring subtraction of a reference background. In this approach,Noether charges associated to Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance vanishidentically for constant curvature spacetimes. The case of zero cosmologicalconstant is obtained as a limit of AdS, where $\Lambda $ plays the role of aregulator.
