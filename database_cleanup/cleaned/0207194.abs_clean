We research the entropy of a black hole in curved space-times by 't Hooft`sapproach, so-called the brick wall method. One of these space-time, aasymptotically dS space-time has two physical horizons; one is a black holehorizon and the other is a cosmological horizon. The others have only onehorizon, a black hole horizon. Using this model, we calculate all thermodynamicquantities containing the background geometric effect and show that entropy isproportional to area of each boundary. Furthermore, we show that theCardy-Verlinde formula can be rederived from the physical quantities of thebrick wall method and this fact becomes a evidence of the dS/CFTcorrespondence.
