We classify the possible discrete (finite) symmetries of two--dimensionalcritical models described by unitary minimal conformally invariant theories. Wefind that all but six models have the group Z_2 as maximal symmetry. Among thesix exceptional theories, four have no symmetry at all, while the other two arethe familiar critical and tricritical 3--Potts models, which both have an S_3symmetry. These symmetries are the expected ones, and coincide with theautomorphism groups of the Dynkin diagrams of simply--laced simple Lie algebrasADE. We note that extended chiral algebras, when present, are almost neverpreserved in the frustrated sectors.
