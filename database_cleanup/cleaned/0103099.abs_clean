String theories with branes can often be generalized by addingbrane-antibrane pairs. We explore the cancellation of anomalies in this moregeneral context, extending the familiar anomaly-cancelling mechanisms, both forten-dimensional string theories with D-branes and for certain supersymmetriccompactifications.
