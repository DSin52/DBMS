I review, with some pedagogy, two different approaches to the computation ofBPS spectra in N=2 supersymmetric QCD with gauge group SU(2). The first one issemiclassical and has been widely used in the literature. The second one makesuse of constraints coming from the non perturbative, global structure of theCoulomb branch of these theories. The second method allows for a description ofdiscontinuities in the BPS spectra at strong coupling, and should lead toaccurate test of duality conjectures in N=2 theories.
