Winding number transitions from quantum to classical behavior are studied inthe case of the {1+1} dimensional Mottola-Wipf model with the space coordinateon a circle for exploring the possibility of obtaining transitions of secondorder. The model is also studied as a prototype theory which demonstrates theprocedure of such investigations. In the model at hand we find that even on acircle the transitions remain those of first order.
