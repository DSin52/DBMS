The AdS/CFT correspondence is employed to derive logarithmic corrections tothe Cardy-Verlinde formula when thermal fluctuations in the Anti-de Sitterblack hole are accounted for. The qualitative effect of these corrections onthe braneworld cosmology is investigated. The role of such terms in enabling acontracting universe to undergo a bounce is demonstrated. Their influence onthe stability of black holes in AdS space and the Hawking-Page-Witten phasetransitions is also discussed.
