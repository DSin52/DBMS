We calculate the one-loop quantum contributions to soft supersymmetrybreaking terms in the scalar potential in supergravity theories regulated \`ala Pauli-Villars. We find ``universal'' contributions, independent of theregulator masses and tree level soft supersymmetry breaking, that contributegaugino masses and A-terms equal to the ``anomaly mediated'' contributionsfound in analyses using spurion techniques, as well as a scalar mass term notidentified in those analyses. The universal terms are in general modified --and in some cases canceled -- by model-dependent terms. Under certainrestrictions on the couplings we recover the one-loop results of previous``anomaly mediated'' supersymmetry breaking scenarios. We emphasize the modeldependence of loop-induced soft terms in the potential, which are much moresensitive to the details of Planck scale physics then are the one-loopcontributions to gaugino masses. We discuss the relation of our results toprevious analyses.
