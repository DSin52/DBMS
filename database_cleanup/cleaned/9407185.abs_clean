We derive the supersymmetric low-energy effective theory of the D-flatdirections of a supersymmetric gauge theory. The Kahler potential of Affleck,Dine and Seiberg is derived by applying holomorphic constraints whichmanifestly maintain supersymmetry. We also present a simple procedure forcalculating all derivatives of the Kahler potential at points on the flatdirection manifold. Together with knowledge of the superpotential, these aresufficient for a complete determination of the spectrum and the interactions ofthe light degrees of freedom. We illustrate the method on the example of achiral abelian model, and comment on its application to more complicatedcalculable models with dynamical supersymmetry breaking.
