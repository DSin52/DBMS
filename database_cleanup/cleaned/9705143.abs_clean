Talk presented in the 97 Karpatcz winter school. We describe Sen's work on Ftheory on K3 and its reflection on the world-volume field theory on a D3-braneprobe. Field theories on a multiple of probes are analyzed. We construct a 4dN=1 superconformal probe theory which is invariant under electric-magneticduality via a compactification to six dimensions on T^6/Z_2 x Z_2.
