We consider possible conformal field theory (CFT) descriptions of the variousinertial ranges that exist in $2d$ duality invariant Magnetohydrodynamics. Suchmodels arise as effective theories of dyonic plasmas in 3 dimensions in whichall fields are independent of the third coordinate. We find new constraints onthe allowed CFT's compared to those that may describe turbulence in $2d$plasmas of electric charges only. The predictions from CFT concerningequipartition of energy amongst the electric and magnetic fields are discussed,and quantities exhibiting universal scaling are derived.
