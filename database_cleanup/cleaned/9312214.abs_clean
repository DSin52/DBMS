Representations of braid group obtained from rational conformal fieldtheories can be used to obtain explicit representations of Temperley-Lieb-Jonesalgebras. The method is described in detail for SU(2)$_k$ Wess - Zuminoconformal field theories and its generalization to an arbitrary rationalconformal field theory outlined. Explicit definition of an associated lineartrace operation in terms of a certain matrix element in the space of conformalblocks of such a conformal theory is presented. Further for every primary fieldof a rational conformal field theory, there is a subfactor of hyperfiniteII$_1$ factor with trivial relative commutant. The index of the subfactor isgiven in terms of identity - identity element of certain duality matrix forconformal blocks of four-point correlators. Jones formula for index ( $<$ 4 )for subfactors corresponds to spin ${\frac{1}{2}}$ representation of SU(2)$_k$Wess-Zumino conformal field theory. Definition of the trace operation alsoprovides a method of obtaining link invariants explicitly.
