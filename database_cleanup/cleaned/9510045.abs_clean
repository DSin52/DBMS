We use the dual description proposed by Seiberg to calculate the pressure inthe low temperature confined phase of $N=1$ supersymmetric QCD usingperturbation theory to $O(g^3_m)$, where $g_m$ is the gauge coupling in thedual theory. Combining this result with the usual high temperature expansionbased on asymptotic freedom, we study how the physics in the intermediatetemperature regime depends on the relative size of the scale parameters in thetwo descriptions. In particular we explore the possibility of having atemperature range where both perturbation expansions are valid.
