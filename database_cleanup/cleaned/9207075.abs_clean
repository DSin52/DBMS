Quantum superalgebras $su_{q}(m\mid n)$ are studied in the framework of$R$-matrix formalism. Explicit parametrization of $L^{(+)}$ and $L^{(-)}$matrices in terms of $su_{q}(m\mid n)$ generators are presented. We also showthat quantum deformation of nonsimple superalgebra $su(n\mid n)$ requires itsextension to $u(n\mid n)$.
