We study large N SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in three and four dimensions using aone-parameter family of supergravity models which originate from non-extremalrotating D-branes. We show explicitly that varying this "angular momentum"parameter decouples the Kaluza-Klein modes associated with the compact D-branecoordinate, while the mass ratios for ordinary glueballs are quite stableagainst this variation, and are in good agreement with the latest latticeresults. We also compute the topological susceptibility and the gluoncondensate as a function of the "angular momentum" parameter.
