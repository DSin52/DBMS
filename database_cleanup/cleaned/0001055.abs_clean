We analyse D-branes on orbifolds with discrete torsion, extending earlierresults. We analyze certain Abelian orbifolds of the type C^3/ \Gamma, where\Gamma is given by Z_m x Z_n, for the most general choice of discrete torsionparameter. By comparing with the AdS/CFT correspondence, we can considerdifferent geometries which give rise to the same physics. This identifies newmirror pairs and suggests new dualities at large N. As a by-product we also geta more geometric picture of discrete torsion.
