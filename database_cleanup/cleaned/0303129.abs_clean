Title: Renormalization of Yang-Mills fields in the light-front without

non-local termsAuthors: Alfredo Takashi Suzuki

Comments: 7 pages

The study of renormalization of Yang-Mills fields in the light-front gaugehas always been a delicate subject in that divergent {\em non-local} termsarise from the calculations of Feynman diagrams. In this short paper we showthat this happened because of a deficiency in the gauge fixing procedure thatresults in an incorrect propagator and propose a cure for it by considering the{\em correct} propagator for the gauge potential. We explicitly show that theuse of our correct propagator in the light-front leads to a vacuum polarizationtensor at the one-loop level that is free of non-local terms.
