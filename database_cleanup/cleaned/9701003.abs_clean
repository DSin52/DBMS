Title: On Generalized Quantum Deformations and Symmetries in Quantum Mechanics

Authors: Jules Beckers

Comments: 7 pages, latex, no figures

Supersymmetric and parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics are now recognized astwo further parts of quantum mechanics containing a lot of new informationsenlightening (solvable) physical applications. Both contents are here analysedin connection with generalized quantum deformations. In fact, theparasupersymmetric context is visited when the order of paraquantization p islimited to the first nontrivial value p = 2.
