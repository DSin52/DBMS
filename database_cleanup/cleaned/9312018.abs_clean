Title: QCD and Strings in 2D

In two dimensions large N QCD with quarks, defined on the plane, isequivalent to a modified string theory with quarks at the ends and taken in thezero fold sector. The equivalence that was established in 1975 was expressed inthe form of an interacting string action that reproduces the spectrum and the1/N interactions of 2D QCD. This action may be a starting point for an analyticcontinuation to a four dimensional string version of QCD. After reviewing theold work I discuss relations to recent developments in the pure QCD-stringequivalence on more complicated background %geometries.
