The Floreanini-Jackiw formulation of the chiral quantum-mechanical systemoscillator is a model of constrained theory with only second-class constraints.in the Dirac's classification.The covariant quantization needs infinite numberof auxiliary variables and a Wess-Zumino term. In this paper we investigate thepath integral quatization of this model using $G\ddot{u}ler's$ canonicalformalism. All variables are gauge variables in this formalism. The Siegel'saction is obtained using Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of the systems withconstraints.
