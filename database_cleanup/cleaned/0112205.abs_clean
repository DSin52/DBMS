In brane world scenarios with a bulk scalar field between two branes it isknown that 4-dimensional Einstein gravity is restored at low energies on eitherbrane. By using a gauge-invariant gravitational and scalar perturbationformalism we extend the theory of weak gravity in the brane world scenarios tohigher energies, or shorter distances. We argue that weak gravity on eitherbrane is indistinguishable from 4-dimensional higher derivative gravity,provided that the inter-brane distance (radion) is stabilized, that thebackground bulk scalar field is changing near the branes and that thebackground bulk geometry near the branes is warped. This argument holds for ageneral conformal transformation to a frame in which matter on the branes isminimally coupled to the metric. In particular, Newton's constant and thecoefficients of curvature-squared terms in the 4-dimensional effective actionare determined up to an ambiguity of adding a Gauss-Bonnet topological term. Inother words, we provide the brane-world realization of the so called$R^2$-model without utilizing a quantum theory. We discuss the appearance ofcomposite spin-2 and spin-0 fields in addition to the graviton on the brane andpoint out a possibility that the spin-0 field may play the role of an effectiveinflaton to drive brane-world inflation. Finally, we conjecture that thesequence of higher derivative terms is an infinite series and, thus, indicatesnon-locality in the brane world scenarios.
