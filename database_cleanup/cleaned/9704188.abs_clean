We study the small oscillations regime (RPA approximation) of thetime-dependent mean-field equations, obtained in a previous work, whichdescribe the time evolution of one-body dynamical variables of a uniformChiral Gross-Neveu system. In this approximation we obtain an analyticalsolution for the time evolution of the one-body dynamical variables. Thetwo-fermion physics can be explored through this solution. The condition forthe existence of bound states is examined.
