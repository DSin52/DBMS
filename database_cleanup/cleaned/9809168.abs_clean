General 2d dilaton theories, containing spherically symmetric gravity andhence the Schwarzschild black hole as a special case, are quantized by an exactpath integral of their geometric (Cartan-) variables. Matter, represented byminimally coupled massless scalar fields is treated in terms of a systematicperturbation theory. The crucial prerequisite for our approach is the use of atemporal gauge for the spin connection and for light cone components of thezweibeine which amounts to an Eddington Finkelstein gauge for the metric. Wederive the generating functional in its most general form which allows aperturbation theory in the scalar fields. The relation of the zero orderfunctional to the classical solution is established. As an example we derivethe effective (gravitationally) induced 4-vertex for scalar fields.
