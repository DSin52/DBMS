In this paper we consider a charged massless scalar quantum field operator inthe spacetime of an idealized cosmic string, i.e., an infinitely long, straightand static cosmic string, which presents a magnetic field confined in acylindrical tube of finite radius. Three distinct situations are taking into{\it{ii)}} a magnetic field proportional to $1/r$ and {\it{iii)}} a cylindricalshell with $\delta$-function. In these three cases the axis of the infinitelylong tube of radius $R$ coincides with the cosmic string. In order to study thevacuum polarization effects outside the tube, we explicitly calculate theEuclidean Green function associated with this system for the three abovesituations, considering points in the region outside the tube.
