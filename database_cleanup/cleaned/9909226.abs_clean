We consider monopole and dyon classical solutions of the Yang-Mills-Higgssystem coupled to gravity in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. We discussboth singular and regular solutions to the second order equations of motionshowing that singular Wu-Yang like dyons can be found, the resulting metricbeing of the Reissner-N\"ordstrom type (with cosmological constant). Concerningregular solutions, we analyze the conditions under which they can beconstructed discussing, for vanishing coupling constant, the main distinctivefeatures related to the anti-de Sitter asymptotic condition; in particular, wefind in this case that the v.e.v. of the Higgs scalar, $|\vec H(\infty)|$,should be quantized in units of the natural mass scale $1/e r_0$ (related tothe cosmological constant) according to $|\vec H(\infty)|^2 = m(m+1) (e r_0)^{-2}$, with $m \in Z$.
