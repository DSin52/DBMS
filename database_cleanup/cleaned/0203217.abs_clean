We argue that G_2 manifolds for M-theory admitting string theory Calabi-Yauduals are fibered by coassociative submanifolds. Dual theories are constructedusing the moduli space of M5-brane fibers as target space. Mirror symmetry andvarious string and M-theory dualities involving G_2 manifolds may beincorporated into this framework. To give some examples, we construct twowith a torus fibration and a metric of G_2 holonomy. Kaluza-Klein reduction ofthe latter solution gives abelian BPS monopoles in 3+1 dimensions.
