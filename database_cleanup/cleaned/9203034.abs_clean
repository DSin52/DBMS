A group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms in 3D turns out to play a keyrole in an Einstein-Maxwell theory whose Weyl tensor is selfdual and whoseMaxwell tensor has algebraically general anti-selfdual part. This model wasfirst introduced by Flaherty and recently studied by Park as an integrabledeformation of selfdual gravity. A twisted volume form on the correspondingtwistor space is shown to be the origin of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms.An immediate consequence is the existence of an infinite number of symmetriesas a generalization of $w_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in selfdual gravity. Apossible relation to Witten's 2D string theory is pointed out.
