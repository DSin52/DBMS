Invited talk at the International Symposium on Generalized Symmetries inPhysics at the Arnold-Sommerfeld-Institute, Clausthal, Germany, July 26 -- July29, 1993. This talk reviews results on the structure of algebras consisting ofmeromorphic differential operators which are holomorphic outside a finite setof points on compact Riemann surfaces. For each partition into two disjointsubsets of the set of points where poles are allowed, a grading of the algebraand of the modules of lambda - forms is introduced. With respect to thisgrading the Lie structure of the algebra and of the modules are almost gradedones. Central extensions and semi-infinite wedge representations are studied.If one considers only differential operators of degree 1 then these algebrasare generalizations of the Virasoro algebra in genus zero, resp. of KricheverNovikov algebras in higher genus.
