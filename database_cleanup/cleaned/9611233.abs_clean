We apply noncommutative geometry to a system of N parallel D-branes, which isinterpreted as a quantum space. The Dirac operator defining the quantumdifferential calculus is identified to be the supercharge for stringsconnecting D-branes. As a result of the calculus, Connes' Yang-Mills actionfunctional on the quantum space reproduces the dimensionally reduced U(N) superYang-Mills action as the low energy effective action for D-brane dynamics.Several features that may look ad hoc in a noncommutative geometricconstruction are shown to have very natural physical or geometric origin in theD-brane picture in superstring theory.
