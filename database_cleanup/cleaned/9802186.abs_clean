We compute the moduli metrics of worldvolume 0-brane solitons of D-branes andthe worldvolume self-dual string solitons of the M-5-brane and examine theirgeometry. We find that the moduli spaces of 0-brane solitons of D-4-branes andD-8-branes are hyper-K\"ahler manifolds with torsion and octonionic K\"ahlermanifolds with torsion, respectively. The moduli space of the self-dual stringsoliton of the M-5-brane is also a hyper-K\"ahler manifold with torsion.
