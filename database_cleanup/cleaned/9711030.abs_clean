We consider a family of non-supersymmetric MQCD five-brane configurationsintroduced by Witten, and discuss the dependence of the curves on themicroscopic theta angle and its relation with CP. We find evidence for anon-trivial spectral flow of the curves (vacua) and for the level-crossing ofadjacent curves at a particular value of the theta angle, with spontaneousbreaking of CP symmetry, providing an MQCD analogue of the phase transitions intheta proposed by 't Hooft.
