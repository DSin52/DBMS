We consider N=2 SUSY QCD with gauge group SU(2) and N_f flavours ofmatter with nonzero mass. Using the method of the instanton-induced effectivevertex we calculate higher derivative corrections to the Seiberg-Witten resultin the momentum expansion of the low energy effective Lagrangian in variousregions of the modular space. Then we focus on a certain higher derivativeoperator on the Higgs branch. We show that the singular behavior of thisoperator comes from values of mass of matter at which charge singularity on theCoulomb branch collides with the monopole or dyon one. Given the behavior ofthis operator at weak coupling coming from instantons as well as its behaviornear points of colliding singularities we find the exact solution for thisoperator.
