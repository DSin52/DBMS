Soc., Providence, RI, 2001.A novel method of transplanting algebras of observables from de Sitter spaceto a large class of Robertson-Walker space-times is exhibited. It allows one toestablish the existence of an abundance of local nets on these spaces whichcomply with a recently proposed condition of geometric modular action. Thecorresponding modular symmetry groups appearing in these examples also satisfya condition of modular stability, which has been suggested as a substitute forthe requirement of positivity of the energy in Minkowski space. Moreover, theyexemplify the conjecture that the modular symmetry groups are genericallylarger than the isometry and conformal groups of the underlying space-times.
