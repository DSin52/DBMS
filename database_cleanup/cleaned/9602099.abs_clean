High Energy Physics and Cosmology, Trieste, Italy, 12 June-28 July, 1995The well known N=2 string theory describes self-dual gravity, as was shown byOoguri and Vafa sometime ago. In search of a variant of this theory which woulddescribe self-dual supergravity in 2+2 dimensions, we have constructed two newN=2 strings theories in which the target space is a superspace. Both theoriescontain massless scalar and spinor fields in their spectrum, and one of themhas spacetime supersymmetry. However, we find that the interactions of thesefields do not correspond to those of self-dual supergravity. In ourconstruction, we have used the basic (2,2) superspace variables, and consideredquadratic constraints in these variables. A more general construction may beneeded for a stringy description of self-dual supergravity.
