We discuss D-branes from a conformal field theory point of view. In thisapproach, branes are described by boundary states providing sources for closedstring modes, independently of classical notions. The boundary states mustconditions between left- and right-moving Virasoro or further symmetrygenerators, whereas the second encompasses non-linear consistency conditionsfrom world sheet duality, which severely restrict the allowed boundarystates. We exploit these conditions to give explicit formulas for boundarystates in Gepner models, thereby computing excitation spectra of braneconfigurations. From the boundary states, brane tensions and RR charges canalso be read off directly.
