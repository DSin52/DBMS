Isotropic XY is considered. It describes interaction of quantum spins on1-dimesional lattice. Alternatevly one can call the model XXO Hiesenbergantiferromagnet. We solved long standing problem of evaluation of temperaturecorelations. We proved that correlation function of the model is $\tau $function of Ablowitz-Ladik PDE. We explicitly evaluated asymptotics.
