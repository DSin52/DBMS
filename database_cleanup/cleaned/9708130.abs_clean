These are a set of lectures presented at the CERN-La Plata-Santiago deCompostella School of Physics, La Plata, May 1997. A brief introduction to thenon-perturbative structure of string theory is presented. Variousnon-perturbative dualities in ten and six dimensions as well as D-branes arediscussed.
