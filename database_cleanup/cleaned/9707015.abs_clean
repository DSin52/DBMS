We suggest that the $\phi^4$ model is only a polynomial approximation to amore fundamental theory. As a consequence the high temperature regime might notbe correctly described by this model. If this turns out to be true then severalresults concerning e.g., critical temperatures, symmetry restoration at hightemperature and high temperature expansions should be reconsidered. Weillustrate our conjecture by using the Nambu-Goto string model. We compare atwo-loop calculation of the free energy or quark-antiquark static potential atfinite temperature with a previous exact calculation in the large-d limit andshow how the perturbative expansion fails to reproduce important features inthe neighborhood of the critical temperature. It becomes clear why this happensin the Nambu-Goto model and we suggest that perhaps something similar occurswith the $\phi^4$ model.
