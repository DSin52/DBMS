The supersymmetry algebra for supermembranes, quantized in the light-conegauge, exhibits central charges induced by wrapping the membrane around compactdimensions. These central charges are manifestly consistent with Lorentzsymmetry. While the central charges raise the mass of the membrane states, theystill leave the mass spectrum continuous, at least generically. The lower boundon the mass spectrum is set by the winding number and corresponds to a BPSstate.
