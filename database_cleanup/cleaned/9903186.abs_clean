We consider Type 0B D3-branes placed at conical singularities and analyze indetail the conifold singularity. We study the non supersymmetric gauge theorieson their worldvolume and their conjectured dual gravity descriptions. In theultraviolet the solutions exhibit a logarithmic running of the gauge coupling.In the infrared we find confining solutions and IR fixed points.
