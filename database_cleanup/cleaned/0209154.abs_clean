The two-dimensional ghost systems with negative integral central chargereceived much attention in the last years for their role in a number ofapplications and in connection with logarithmic conformal field theory. Weconsider the free massive bosonic and fermionic ghost systems and concentrateon the non-trivial sectors containing the disorder operators. A unifiedanalysis of the correlation functions of such operators can be performed forghosts and ordinary complex bosons and fermions. It turns out that thesecorrelators depend only on the statistics although the scaling dimensions ofthe disorder operators change when going from the ordinary to the ghost case.As known from the study of the ordinary case, the bosonic and fermioniccorrelation functions are the inverse of each other and are exactly expressiblethrough the solution of a non-linear differential equation.
