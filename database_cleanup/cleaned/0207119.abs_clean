Title: Rolling Tachyon in Brane World Cosmology from Superstring Field Theory

Authors: Gary Shiu, S.-H. Henry Tye and Ira Wasserman

Comments: 4 pages, one figure. This version quantifies constraints on various

phenomenological models for tachyon decayThe pressureless tachyonic matter recently found in superstring field theoryhas an over-abundance problem in cosmology. We argue that this problem isnaturally solved in the brane inflationary scenario if almost all of thetachyon energy is drained (via its coupling to the inflaton and matter fields)to heating the universe, while the rest of the tachyon energy goes to a networkof cosmic strings (lower-dimensional BPS D-branes) produced during the tachyonrolling at the end of inflation.
