We study one-loop effective action of Berkooz-Douglas Matrix theory andobtain non-abelian action of D0-branes in the longitudinal 5-brane background.In this paper, we extend the analysis of hep-th/0201248 and calculate the partof the effective action containing fermions. We show that the effective actionis manifestly invariant under the loop-corrected SUSY transformation, and givethe explicit transformation laws. The effective action consists of blocks whichare closed under the SUSY, and includes the supersymmetric completion of thecouplings to the longitudinal 5-branes proposed by Taylor and Van Raamsdonk asa subset.
