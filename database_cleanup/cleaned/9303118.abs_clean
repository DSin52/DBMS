Generalizing the mapping between the Potts model with nearest neighborinteraction and six vertex model, we build a family of "fused Potts models"related to the spin $k/2$ ${\rm U}_{q}{\rm su}(2)$ invariant vertex model andquantum spin chain. These Potts model have still variables taking values$1,\ldots,Q$ ($\sqrt{Q}=q+q^{-1}$) but they have a set of complicated multispin interactions. The general technique to compute these interactions, theresulting lattice geometry, symmetries, and the detailed examples of $k=2,3$are given. For $Q>4$ spontaneous magnetizations are computed on the integrablefirst order phase transition line, generalizing Baxter's results for $k=1$. For$Q\leq 4$, we discuss the full phase diagram of the spin one ($k=2$)anisotropic and ${\rm U}_{q}{\rm su}(2)$ invariant quantum spin chain (itreduces in the limit $Q=4$ ($q=1$) to the much studied phase diagram of theisotropic spin one quantum chain). Several critical lines and massless phasesare exhibited. The appropriate generalization of the Valence Bond State methodof Affleck et al. is worked out.
