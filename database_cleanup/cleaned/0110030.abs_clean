Title: Gauge Field on Brane in M-atrix Theory

Authors: Takeshi Inagaki

Comments: 3 pages

In this ultra short note, gauge field propagation in D-brane configuration ofM theory in the BFSS matrix formulation is considered. Noncommutativity of thespace plays a key role for appearance of gauge fields as physical degrees offreedom.
