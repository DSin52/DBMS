We study rolling radii solutions in the context of the four- andfive-dimensional effective actions of heterotic M-theory. For the standardfour-dimensional solutions with varying dilaton and T-modulus, we findapproximate five-dimensional counterparts. These are new, genericallynon-separating solutions corresponding to a pair of five-dimensional domainwalls evolving in time. Loop corrections in the four-dimensional theory aredescribed by certain excitations of fields in the fifth dimension. We point outthat the two exact separable solutions previously discovered are precisely thespecial cases for which the loop corrections are time-independent. Generically,loop corrections vary with time. Moreover, for a subset of solutions theyincrease in time, evolving into complicated, non-separating solutions. In thispaper we compute these solutions to leading, non-trivial order. Using theequations for the induced brane metric, we present a general argument showingthat the accelerating backgrounds of this type cannot evolve smoothly intodecelerating backgrounds.
