On the example of nonabelian Toda type theory associated with the Liesuperalgebra $osp(2|4)$ we show that this integrable dynamical system isrelevant to a black hole background metric in the corresponding target space.In the even sector the model under consideration reduces to the exactlysolvable conformal theory (nonabelian $B_2$ Toda system) in the presence of ablack hole recently proposed in the article "Black holes from non-abelian Todatheories" by the last two authors (hep-th 9203039).
