A generalization of duality transformations for arbitrary Lorentz tensors ispresented, and a systematic scheme for constructing the dual descriptions isdeveloped. The method, a purely Lagrangian approach, is based on a first orderparent Lagrangian, from which the dual partners are generated. In particular, afamily of theories which are dual to the massive spin two Fierz-Pauli field,both free and coupled to an external source, is constructed in terms of a thirdrank tensor which is taken as the basic configuration variable.
