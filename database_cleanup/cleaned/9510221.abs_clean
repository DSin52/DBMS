A consistent method for calculating the interquark potential generated by therelativistic string with massive ends is proposed. In this approach theinterquark potential in the model of the Nambu--Goto string with point--likemasses at its ends is calculated. At first the calculation is done in theone--loop approximation and then the variational estimation is performed. Thequark mass correction results in decreasing the critical distance(deconfinement radius). When quark mass decreases the critical distance alsodecreases. For obtaining a finite result under summation over eigenfrequenciesof the Nambu--Goto string with massive ends a suitable mode--by--modesubtraction is proposed. This renormalization procedure proves to be completelyunique. In the framework of the developed approach the one--loop interquarkpotential in the model of the relativistic string with rigidity is alsocalculated.
