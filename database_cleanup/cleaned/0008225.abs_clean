In this paper we revisit the arguments that have led to the proposal of amulti-instanton measure for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We then recallhow the moduli space of gauge connections on $\real^4$ can be built from ahyperk\"ahler quotient construction which we generalize to supermanifolds. Themeasure we are looking for is given by the supermetric of the supermoduli spacethus introduced. To elucidate the construction we carry out explicitcomputations in the case of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories.
