following changes relative to the original. A. Supplement formulas(2.3.9a)-(2.3.9d) etc.; B. To correct some contentsOn the basis a new conjecture, we present a new Lagrangian density and a newquantization method for QED, construct coupling operators and mass operators,derive scattering operators S_{f} and S_{w} which are dependent on each otherand supplement new Feynman rules. S_{f} and S_{w} together determine a Fenmanintegral. Hence all Feynman integrals are convergent and it is unnecessary tointroduce regularization and counterterms. That the energy of the vacuum stateis equal to zero is naturally obtained. From this we can easily determine thecosmological constant according to data of astronomical observation, and it ispossible to correct nonperturbational methods which depend on the energy of theground state in quantum field theory. On the same basis as the new QED, weobtain naturally a new SU(2)XU(1) electroweak unified model whose L=L_{F}+L_{W}, here L is left-right symmetric. Thus the world is left-right symmetric inprinciple, but the part observed by us is asymmetric because L_{W} and L_{F}are all asymmetic. This model do not contain any unknown particle with amassive mass. A conjecture that there is repulsion or gravitation between theW-particles and the F-particles is presented. If the new interaction isgravitation, W-matter is the candidate for dark matter. If the new interactionis repulsion, W-matter is the origin of universe expansion.
