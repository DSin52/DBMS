We analyse of the effective action of the tachyon field on a D-brane, of bothbosonic as well as superstring theory. We find that the non-standard kineticterm of the tachyon field requires a correction to the Born-Infeld typeLagrangian. The cosmological significance of the resulting dynamics isexplored. We also examine if the rolling tachyon can provide an effectivecosmological constant and contrast its behaviour with quintessence.
