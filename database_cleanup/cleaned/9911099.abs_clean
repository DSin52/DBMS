Field theory with instantons can be partially regularized by adding degreesof freedom at some scale. These extra degrees of freedom lead to the appearenceof the new topological defects. These defects which we call freckles have somecharacteristic size depending on the scale at which the extra degrees offreedom revive.The examples of two dimensional sigma model, four dimensional gauge theoryare studied. The compactification of the four dimensional supersymmetric gaugetheory down to two dimensions is also considered and the new phenomena arefound.
