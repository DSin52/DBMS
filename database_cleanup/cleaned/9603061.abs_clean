We derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for four-dimensionalReissner-Nordstrom extremal black holes in type II string theory. Thederivation is performed in two separate (T-dual) weak coupling pictures. Oneuses a type IIB bound state problem of D5- and D1-branes, while the other usesa bound state problem of D0- and D4-branes with macroscopic fundamental typeIIA strings. In both cases, the D-brane systems are also bound to aKaluza-Klein monopole, which then yields the four-dimensional black hole atstrong coupling.
