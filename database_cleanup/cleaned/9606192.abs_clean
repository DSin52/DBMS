These notes are based on work done in collaboration with Frank Ferrari. Weshow how to determine the spectra of stable BPS states in $N=2$ supersymmetric$SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theories that are asymptotically free, i.e. without and withmarginal stability diffeomorphic to a circle and going through all (finite)singular points of moduli space. $\bullet$ The BPS spectra are discontinuousacross these curves. $\bullet$ The strong-coupling spectra (inside the curves)contain only those BPS states that can become massless and are responsible forthe singularities. Except for $N_f=3$, they form a multiplet (with differentmasses) of the broken global discrete symmetry. $\bullet$ All othersemi-classical BPS states must and do decay consistently when crossing thecurves. $\bullet$ The weak-coupling, i.e. semi-classical BPS spectra, containno magnetic charges larger than one for $N_f=0,1,2$ and no magnetic chargeslarger than two for $N_f=3$.
