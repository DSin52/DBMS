We analyze (3+1)-dimensional black-hole space-times in spontaneously brokenYang-Mills gauge theories that have been recently presented as candidates foran evasion of the scalar-no-hair theorem. Although we show that in principlethe conditions for the no-hair theorem do not apply to this case, however weprove that the `spirit' of the theorem is not violated, in the sense that thereexist instabilities, in both the sphaleron and gravitational sectors. Theinstability analysis of the sphaleron sector, which was expected to be unstablefor topological reasons, is performed by means of a variational method. Asshown, there exist modes in this sector that are unstable against linearperturbations. Instabilities exist also in the gravitational sector. A methodfor counting the gravitational unstable modes, which utilizes acatastrophe-theoretic approach is presented. The r\^ole of the catastrophefunctional is played by the mass functional of the black hole. The Higgs vacuumexpectation value (v.e.v.) is used as a control parameter, having a criticalvalue beyond which instabilities are turned on. The (stable) Schwarzschildsolution is then understood from this point of view. The catastrophe-theoryappproach facilitates enormously a universal stability study of non-Abelianblack holes, which goes beyond linearized perturbations. Some elementaryentropy considerations are also presented...
