In three dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons massless scalar electrodynamicswith $ \phi^6$ coupling, the $U(1)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken at twoloop order regardless of the presence or absence of the Maxwell term.Dimensional transmutation takes place in pure Chern-Simons scalarelectrodynamics. The beta function for the $\phi^6$ coupling is independent ofgauge couplings.
