We consider the open string sigma-model in the presence of a constantNeveu-Schwarz B-field on the world-sheet that is topologically equivalent to adisk with n holes. First, we compute the sigma-model partition function.Second, we make a consistency check of ideas about the appearance ofnoncommutative geometry within open strings.
