We use the AdS/CFT duality to study the special point on the Coulomb branchof ${\cal N}=4$ SU(N) gauge theory which corresponds to a spherically symmetricshell of D3-branes. This point is of interest both because the spacetime regioninside the shell is flat, and because this configuration gives a very simpleexample of the transition between D-branes in the perturbative string regimeand the non-perturbative regime of black holes. We discuss how this geometry isdescribed in the dual gauge theory, through its effect on the two-pointfunctions and Wilson loops. In the calculation of the two-point function, westress the importance of absorption by the branes.
