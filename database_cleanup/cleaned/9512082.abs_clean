Title: Super p-Form Charges and a Reformulation of the Supermembrane Action in

Eleven DimensionsComments: 11 pages, LaTex, Contribution to the Leuven Workshop, July 1995

We discuss an extension of the super-Poincar\'e algebra in $D=11$ whichincludes an extra fermionic charge and super two-form charges. We give ageometrical reformulation of the $D=11$ supermembrane action which ismanifestly invariant under the extended super-Poincar\'e transformations. Usingthe same set of transformations, we also reformulate a superstring action in$D=11$, considered sometime ago by Curtright. While this paper is primarily areview of a recent work by Bergshoeff and the author, it does contain some newresults.
