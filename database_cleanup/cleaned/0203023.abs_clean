In the Orientiworld framework the Standard Model fields are localized onD3-branes sitting on top of an orientifold 3-plane. The transverse6-dimensional space is a non-compact orbifold (or a more general conifold). The4-dimensional gravity on D3-branes is reproduced due to the 4-dimensionalEinstein-Hilbert term induced at the quantum level. The orientifold 3-planeplays a crucial role, in particular, without it the D3-brane world-volumetheories would be conformal due to the tadpole cancellation. We studynon-perturbative gauge dynamics in various N=1 supersymmetric orientiworldmodels based on the Z_3 as well as Z_5 and Z_7 orbifold groups. Our discussionsillustrate that there is a rich variety of supersymmetry preserving dynamics insome of these models. On the other hand, we also find some models withdynamical supersymmetry breaking.
