Title: Q-states Potts model on a random planar lattice

Comments: 12 pages, 1 PostScript figure, with epsf

We propose a matrix-model derivation of the scaling exponents of the criticaland tricritical q-states Potts model coupled to gravity on a sphere. In closeanalogy with the $O(n)$ model, we reduce the determination of theone-loop-to-vacuum expectation to the resolution of algebraic equations; andfind the explicit scaling law for the case q=3.
