We study the conformal spectra of the critical square lattice Ising model onthe Klein bottle and M\"obius strip using Yang-Baxter techniques and thesolution of functional equations. In particular, we obtain expressions for thefinitized conformal partition functions in terms of finitized Virasorocharacters. This demonstrates that Yang-Baxter techniques and functionalequations can be used to study the conformal spectra of more general exactlysolvable lattice models in these topologies. The results rely on certainproperties of the eigenvalues which are confirmed numerically.
