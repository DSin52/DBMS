We derive several results concerning non-perturbative renormalization in thespherical field formalism. Using a small set of local counterterms, we are ableto remove all ultraviolet divergences in a manner such that the renormalizedtheory is finite and translationally invariant. As an explicit example weconsider massless phi^4 theory in four dimensions.
