We prove mirror symmetry for supersymmetric sigma models on Kahler manifoldsin 1+1 dimensions. The proof involves establishing the equivalence of thegauged linear sigma model, embedded in a theory with an enlarged gaugesymmetry, with a Landau-Ginzburg theory of Toda type. Standard R -> 1/R dualityand dynamical generation of superpotential by vortices are crucial in thederivation. This provides not only a proof of mirror symmetry in the case of(local and global) Calabi-Yau manifolds, but also for sigma models on manifoldswith positive first Chern class, including deformations of the action byholomorphic isometries.
