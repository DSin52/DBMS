A combined model of the Kerr spinning particle and superparticle isconsidered. The structure of the Kerr geometry is presented in a complex formas being created by a complex source. A natural supergeneralization of thisconstruction is obtained corresponding to a complex "supersource". Peforming asupershift to the Kerr and Kerr-Sen solutions we obtain metrics of supergravityblack holes with a nonlinear realization of broken supersymmetry.
