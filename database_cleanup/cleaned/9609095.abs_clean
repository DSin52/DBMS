The M-theory interpretation of certain D=10 IIA p-branes implies theexistence of worldvolume Kaluza-Klein modes which are expected to appear as0-brane/p-brane bound states preserving 1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetry. Weconstruct the corresponding solutions of the effective supergravity theory for$p=1,4$, and show that no such solution exists for $p=8$.
