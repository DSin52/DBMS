We consider here the Chern-Simons field theory with gauge group SU(N) in thepresence of a gravitational background that describes a two-dimensionalspatially flat {\it Robertson-Walker} space-time and the conformally staticspace-times having a general closed and orientable Riemann surface as spatialsection. The propagator and the vertices are explicitely computed at the lowestorder in perturbation theory imposing the Coulomb gauge fixing.
