We study the time-dependent tachyon backgrounds of the string collectivefield theory using the formalism of the $S$-matrix generating functional. Inthe process we clarify the connection between two ways of calculating the$S$-matrix, the one using the Feynman rule and the other using the classicalsolution to the nonlinear equation of motion. We develop the formalism forgeneral backgrounds and apply it to the gravitational sine-Gordon model indetail. We reproduce the conformal field theory calculation which was based onexpanding around the static $c=1$ theory. Furthermore, we prove that the tree-level partition function of this model shows the scaling behavior correspondingto $c=0$ model in the limit $p \to 0$ of sine-Gordon `momentum' $p$.
