In this note the Polyakov equation [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 52} (1995) 6183] forthe velocity-difference PDF, with the exciting force correlation function$\kappa (y)\sim1-y^{\alpha}$ is analyzed. Several solvable cases areconsidered, which are in a good agreement with available numerical results.Then it is shown how the method developed by A. Polyakov can be applied toturbulence with short-scale-correlated forces, a situation considered in modelsof self-organized criticality.
