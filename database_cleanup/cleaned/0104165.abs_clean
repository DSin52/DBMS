A method is described for the development of the one-loop effective actionexpansion as an asymptotic series in inverse powers of the fermion mass. Themethod is based on the Schwinger-DeWitt proper-time technique, which allows forloop particles with non-degenerate masses. The case with SU(2)xSU(2) as thesymmetry group is considered. The obtained novel series generalizes thewell-known Schwinger-De Witt inverse mass expansion for equal masses, and ischiral invariant at each order. We calculate the asymptotic coefficients up tofifth order and clarify their relationship with the standard Seeley-DeWittcoefficients.
