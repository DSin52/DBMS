Title: Resumming the Effective Action

Authors: A. Leonidov, A. Zelnikov

Comments: 7 pages, BI-TP 93/38 (revised)

At the simple example of a massless scalar field propagating in the staticbackground we study the resummed expressions for the effective action at zeroand finite temperature that are free from a usual sickness of the effectiveaction induced by massless particles.
