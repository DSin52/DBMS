An $U_q(sl(n))$ invariant transfer matrix with periodic boundary conditionsis analysed by means of the algebraic nested Bethe ansatz for the case of $q$being a root of unity. The transfer matrix corresponds to a 2-dimensionalvertex model on a torus with topological interaction w.r.t. the 3-dimensionalinterior of the torus. By means of finite size analysis we find the centralcharge of the corresponding Virasoro algebra as $c=(n-1)\left[1-n(n+1)/(r(r-1))\right] $.
