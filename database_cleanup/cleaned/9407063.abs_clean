We present a summary of the results of an explicit calculation of thestrength of non-perturbative interactions in matrix models and string effectiveLagrangians. These interactions are induced by single eigenvalue instantons inthe $d=1$ bosonic matrix model. A well defined approximation scheme is used toobtain induced operators whose exact form we exhibit. We briefly discuss thepossibility that similar instantons in a supersymmetric version of the theorymay break supersymmetry dynamically.
