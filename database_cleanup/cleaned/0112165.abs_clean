We study the dynamical equations for extra-dimensional dependence of a warpfactor and a bulk scalar in 5d brane world scenarios with induced brane metricof constant curvature. These equations are similar to those for the timedependence of the scale factor and a scalar field in 4d cosmology, but with thesign of the scalar field potential reversed. Based on this analogy, weintroduce novel methods for studying the warped geometry. We construct the fullphase portraits of the warp factor/scalar system for several examples of thebulk potential. This allows us to view the global properties of the warpedgeometry. For flat branes, the phase portrait is two dimensional. Moving alongtypical phase trajectories, the warp factor is initially increasing and finallydecreasing. All trajectories have timelike gradient-dominated singularities atone or both of their ends, which are reachable in a finite distance and must bescreened by the branes. For curved branes, the phase portrait is threedimensional. However, as the warp factor increases the phase trajectories tendtowards the two dimensional surface corresponding to flat branes. We discussthis property as a mechanism that may stretch the curved brane to be almostflat, with a small cosmological constant. Finally, we describe the embedding ofbranes in the 5d bulk using the phase space geometric methods developed here.In this language the boundary conditions at the branes can be described as a 1dcurve in the phase space. We discuss the naturalness of tuning the branepotential to stabilize the brane world system.
