A matrix model for type 0 strings is proposed. It consists in making anon-supersymmetric orbifold projection in the Yang-Mills theory and identifyingthe infrared configurations of the system at infinite coupling with strings.The correct partition function is calculated. Also, the usual spectrum ofbranes is found. Both type A and B models are constructed. The model in a toruscontains all the degrees of freedom and interpolates between the four stringtheories (IIA, IIB, 0A, 0B) and the M theory as different limits are taken.
