We introduce the chemical potential in a system of two-flavored masslessfermions in a chiral bag by imposing boundary conditions in the Euclidean timedirection. We express the fermionic mean number in terms of a functional traceinvolving the Green function of the boundary value problem, which is studiedanalytically. Numerical evaluations for the fermionic number are presented.
