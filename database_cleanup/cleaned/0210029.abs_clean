We investigate cosmological evolutions of the bulk scalar field $\phi(t)$ andthe radion $d(t)$ in five-dimensional dilatonic two branes model. The bulkpotential for the scalar field is taken as the exponential function $V_{bulk}\propto \exp(-2 \sqrt{2} b\phi)$, where $b$ is the parameter of the theory.This model includes Randall-Sundrum model (with $b=0$) and five-dimensionalHo\v{r}ava-Witten theory (with $b=1$). We consider matter on both branes andarbitrary potentials on the branes and in the bulk. These matter and potentialsinduce the cosmological expansion of the brane as well as the time evolution ofthe bulk scalar field and the radion. Starting with full five-dimensionalequations, we derive four-dimensional effective equations which govern thelow-energy dynamics of brane worlds. A correspondent five-dimensional geometryis also obtained. The effective four-dimensional theory on a positive tensionbrane is described by bi-scalar tensor theory. If the radion is stabilized, theeffective theory becomes Brans-Dicke (BD) theory with BD parameter $1/2 b^2$.On the other hand, if the scalar field is stabilized, the effective theorybecomes scalar-tensor theory with BD parameter$\frac{3}{2(3b^2+1)}\frac{\phi(t)}{1-\phi(t)}$ where $\phi$ is the BD fielddefined by radion $d(t)$. If we do not introduce the stabilization mechanismfor these moduli fields, the acceptable late time cosmology can be realizedonly if the dilaton coupling $b$ is small ($b^2 < 1.6 \times 10^{-4}$) and thenegative tension brane is sufficiently away from the positive tension brane. Wealso construct several models for inflationary brane worlds driven bypotentials on the brane and in the bulk.
