The one-loop quantum corrections to the free energy associated with scalarfield in a higher dimensional static curved space-time is investigated makinguse of the conformal transformation method. For a space-time with bifurcatehorizon, horizon divergences are accounted for choosing the Planck length asnatural cutoff. The leading term in the high temperature quantum correctionsatifies holographically the "area law", like the tree level Bekenstein-Hawkingterm. Furthermore it is stressed that only for the asymptotically AdS blackholes one may have a microscopic interpretation of the entropy also at quantumlevel.
