School on Modern Math. Physics, Sept. 2002, Kopaonik (Yugoslavia)We discuss a new class of brane models (extending both p-brane and Dp-branecases) where the brane tension appears as an additional dynamical degree offreedom instead of being put in by hand as an ad hoc dimensionfull scale.Consistency of dynamics naturally involves the appearence of additionalhigher-rank antisymmetric tensor gauge fields on the world-volume which cancouple to charged lower-dimensional branes living on the original Dp-braneworld-volume. The dynamical tension has the physical meaning of electric-typefield strength of the additional higher-rank world-volume gauge fields. Itobeys Maxwell (or Yang-Mills) equations of motion (in the string case p=1) ortheir higher-rank gauge theory analogues (in the Dp-brane case). This inparticular triggers a simple classical mechanism of ("color") chargeconfinement.
