We describe a class of six-dimensional conformal field theories that havesome properties in common with and possibly are related to a subsector of thetensionless string theories. The latter theories can for example give rise tofour-dimensional $N = 4$ superconformal Yang-Mills theories uponcompactification on a two-torus. Just like the tensionless string theories, ourtheories have an $ADE$-classification, but no other discrete or continuousparameters. The Hilbert space carries an irreducible representation of the sameHeisenberg group that appears in the tensionless string theories, and the`Wilson surface' observables obey the same superselection rules. Whencompactified on a two-torus, they have the same behaviour under $S$-duality assuper Yang-Mills theory. Our theories are natural generalizations of thetwo-form with self-dual field strength that is part of the world-volume theoryof a single five-brane in $M$-theory, and the $A_{N - 1}$ theory can in fact beseen as arising from $N$ non-interacting chiral two-forms by factoring out thecollective `center of mass' degrees of freedom.
