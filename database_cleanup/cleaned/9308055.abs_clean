On an oriented, compact, connected, real four-dimensional manifold, $M$, weintroduce a topological Lagrangian gauge field theory with a Bogomol'nyistructure that leads to non-singular, finite-Action, stable solutions to thevariational field equations. These soliton-like solutions are analogous to theinstanton in Yang-Mills theory. Unlike Yang-Mills instantons, however,`topological' instantons are independent of any underlying metric structure,and, in particular, they are independent of the metric signature. We show thatwhen the topology of the underlying manifold, $M$, is equipped with a complexK\"ahler structure, and $M$ is interpreted as space-time, then the moduli spaceof topological instantons---the space of motions---is a finite-dimensional,smooth, Hausdorff manifold with a natural symplectic structure. We identifyspace-time topologies which lead to the physical stability of topologicalinstanton field configurations compatible with the additional geometricstructures. The spaces of motion for $U(1)$ topological instantons over eitherminimal elliptic or algebraic complex space-times with irregularity $q=2$ areexamined.
