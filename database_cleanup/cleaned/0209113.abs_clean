We analyze the renormalization properties of quantum field theories in deSitter space and show that only two of the maximally invariant vacuum states offree fields lead to consistent perturbation expansions. One is the Euclideanvacuum, and the other can be viewed as an analytic continuation of Euclideanfunctional integrals on $RP^d$. The corresponding Lorentzian manifold is thefuture half of global de Sitter space with boundary conditions on fields at theorigin of time. We argue that the perturbation series in this case hasdivergences at the origin, which render the future evolution of the systemindeterminate without a better understanding of high energy physics.
