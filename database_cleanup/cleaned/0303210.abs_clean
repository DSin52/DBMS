We construct a large-N twisted reduced model of the four-dimensional superYang-Mills theory coupled to one adjoint matter. We first consider anon-commutative version of the four-dimensional superspace, and then give themapping rule between matrices and functions on this space explicitly. Thesupersymmetry is realized as a part of the internal $U(\infty)$ gauge symmetryin this reduced model. Our reduced model can be compared with theDijkgraaf-Vafa theory that claims the low-energy glueball superpotential of theoriginal gauge theory is governed by a simple one-matrix model. We show thattheir claim can be regarded as the large-N reduction in the sense that theone-matrix model they proposed can be identified with our reduced model. Themap between matrices and functions enables us to make direct identities betweenthe free energies and correlators of the gauge theory and the matrix model. Asa by-product, we can give a natural explanation for the unconventionaltreatment of the one-matrix model in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory whereeigenvalues lie around the top of the potential.
