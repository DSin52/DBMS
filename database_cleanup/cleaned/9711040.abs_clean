We present a class of BPS solutions of the IIB Matrix Theory which preserve1/4 supersymmetry. The solutions desrcibe D-string configurations withleft-moving oscillations. We demonstrate that the one-loop quantum effectiveaction of Matrix Theory vanishes for this solution, confirming its BPS nature.We also study the world-volume gauge theory of oscillating strings and show itsconnection with static D-strings.
