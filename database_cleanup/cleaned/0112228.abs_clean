We discuss general properties of classical string field theories withsymmetric vertices in the context of deformation theory. For a given conformalbackground there are many string field theories corresponding to differentdecomposition of moduli space of Riemann surfaces. It is shown that anyclassical open string field theories on a fixed conformal background are$A_\infty$-quasi-isomorphic to each other. This indicates that they haveisomorphic moduli space of classical solutions. The minimal model theorem in$A_\infty$-algebras plays a key role in these results. Its natural andgeometric realization on formal supermanifolds is also given. The same resultshold for classical closed string field theories, whose algebraic structure isgoverned by $L_\infty$-algebras.
