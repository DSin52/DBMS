In the light of $\phi$-mapping method and topological current theory, thetopological structure and the topological quantization of topological lineardefects are obtained under the condition that the Jacobian $J(\phi/v) \neq 0$.When $J(\phi/v) = 0$, it is shown that there exist the crucial case of branchprocess. Based on the implicit function theorem and the Taylor expansion, theorigin and bifurcation of the linear defects are detailed in the neighborhoodsof the limit points and bifurcation points of $\phi$-mapping, respectively.
