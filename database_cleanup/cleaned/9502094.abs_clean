We discuss the dressing of one-loop sigma-model beta-functions by inducedsupergravity, for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric theories. We obtain exactresults by a superconformal gauge argument, and verify them in thesemi-classical limit by explicit perturbative calculations in the light-conegauge. We find that for N=2 theories there is no dressing of the one-loopbeta-functions.
