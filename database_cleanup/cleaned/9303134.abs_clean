A canonical quantization for two dimensional gravity models, including adilaton gravity model, is performed in a way suitable for the light-cone gauge.We extend the theory developed by Abdalla {\it et.al.}\cite{AM} and obtain thecorrelation functions by using the screening charges of the symmetry algebra.It turns out that the role of the cosmological constant term in the Liouvilletheory is played by the screening charge of the symmetry algebra and theresulting theory looks like a chiral part of the Liouville theory or anon-critical open string theory. Moreover, we show that the dilaton gravitytheory has a symmetry realized by the centrally extended Poincar\'{e} algebrainstead of the $\slr$ Kac-Moody algebra which is a symmetry of an ordinary twodimensional gravity theory.
