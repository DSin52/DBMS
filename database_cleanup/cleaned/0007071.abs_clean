We propose a monodromy invariant pairing $K_{hol}(X) \otimes H_3(X^\vee,\ZZ)\to \IQ$ for a mirror pair of Calabi-Yau manifolds, $(X,X^\vee)$. This pairingis utilized implicitly in the previous calculations of the prepotentials forGromov-Witten invariants. After identifying the pairing explicitly we interpretsome hypergeometric series from the viewpoint of homological mirror symmetrydue to Kontsevich. Also we consider the local mirror symmetry limit to delPezzo surfaces in Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
