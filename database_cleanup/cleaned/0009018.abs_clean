We show that ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity with a cosmological constant can beexpressed as constrained topological field theory based on the supergroup$Osp(1|4)$. The theory is then extended to include timelike boundaries withfinite spatial area. Consistent boundary conditions are found which induce aboundary theory based on a supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory. The boundarystate space is constructed from states of the boundary supersymmetricChern-Simons theory on the punctured two sphere and naturally satisfies theBekenstein bound, where area is measured by the area operator of quantumsupergravity.
