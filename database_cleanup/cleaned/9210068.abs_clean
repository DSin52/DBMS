Using techniques from supergravity and dimensional reduction, we study thefull isometry algebra of K\"ahler and quaternionic manifolds with specialgeometry. These two varieties are related by the so-called c-map, which can beunderstood from dimensional reduction of supergravity theories or by changingchirality assignments in the underlying superstring theory. An importantsubclass, studied in detail, consists of the spaces that follow from realspecial spaces using the so-called r-map. We generally clarify the presence of`extra' symmetries emerging from dimensional reduction and give the conditionsfor the existence of `hidden' symmetries. These symmetries play a major role inour analysis. We specify the structure of the homogeneous special manifolds ascoset spaces $G/H$. These include all homogeneous quaternionic spaces.
