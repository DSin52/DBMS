We report the statistical properties of classical particles in (2+1) gravityas resulting from numerical simulations. Only particle momenta have been takeninto account. In the range of total momentum where thermal equilibrium isreached, the distribution function and the corresponding Boltzmann entropy arecomputed. In the presence of large gravity effects, different extensions of thetemperature turn out to be inequivalent, the distribution function has a powerlaw high-energy tail and the entropy as a function of the internal energypresents a flex. When the energy approaches the open universe limit, theentropy and the mean value of the particle kinetic energy seem to diverge.
