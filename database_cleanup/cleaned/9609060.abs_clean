We give a general method to construct a complete set of linearly independentCasimir operators of a Lie algebra with rank N. For a Casimir operator ofdegree p, this will be provided by an explicit calculation of its symmetriccoefficients $ g^{A_1,A_2,.. A_p}$. It is seen that these coefficients can bedescibed by some rational polinomials of rank N. These polinomials are alsomultilinear in Cartan sub-algebra indices taking values from the set $I_0 ={1,2,.. N}$. The crucial point here is that for each degree one needs, ingeneral, more than one polinomials. This in fact is related with an observationthat the whole set of symmetric coefficients $ g^{A_1,A_2,.. A_p} $ isdecomposed into sum subsets which are in one to one correspondence with thesepolinomials. We call these subsets clusters and introduce some indicators withwhich we specify different clusters. These indicators determine all theclusters whatever the numerical values of coefficients $g^{A_1,A_2,.. A_p}$are. For any degree p, the number of clusters is independent of rank N. Thishence allows us to generalize our results to any value of rank N.To specify the general framework explicit constructions of 4th and 5th orderCasimir operators of $A_N$ Lie algebras are studied and all the polinomialswhich specify the numerical value of their coefficients are given explicitly.
