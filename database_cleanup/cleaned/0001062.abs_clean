We discuss the appearance of modular functions at the one-loop gauge andgravitational couplings in (0,2) non-decomposable N=1 four dimensional orbifoldcompactifications of the heterotic string. We define the limits for theexistence of states causing singularities in the moduli space in theperturbative regime for a generic vacuum of the heterotic string. The "proof"provides evidence for the explanation of the stringy Higgs effect.
