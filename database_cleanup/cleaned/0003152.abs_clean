European Program Meeting on Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetryand Unification, Paris, September 1999Anomalous U(1) gauge symmetries can appear both in heterotic and type Istring theories. In the heterotic case we find a single anomalous U(1), whilein open string theories several such symmetries can appear. Nonetheless, thereis a conjectured duality symmetry that might connect these two theories. Wereview the properties of anomalous gauge symmetries in various string theoriesas well as the status of this heterotic-type I/II duality. We also comment onthe possible phenomenological applications of anomalous gauge symmetries instring theory.
