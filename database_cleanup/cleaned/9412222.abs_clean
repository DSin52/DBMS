We extend Witten's discussion of actions related to the Landau-Ginzburgdescription of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces to coverthe mirror class of models that include twisted chiral matter multiplets and anewly discovered 2D, N = 2 twisted vector multiplet. Certain integrabilityobstructions are observed that constrain the most general constructionscontaining both matter and twisted matter simultaneously. It is conjecturedthat knot invariants will ultimately play a role in describing the most generalsuch model.
