Recent work in Euclidean quantum gravity has studied boundary conditionswhich are completely invariant under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms on metricperturbations. On using the de Donder gauge-averaging functional, this schemeleads to both normal and tangential derivatives in the boundary conditions. Inthe present paper, it is proved that the corresponding boundary value problemfails to be strongly elliptic. The result raises deep interpretative issues forEuclidean quantum gravity on manifolds with boundary.
