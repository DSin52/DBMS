We extend the coset space formulation of the one-field realization of$w_{1+\infty}$ to include more fields as the coset parameters. This can be doneeither by choosing a smaller stability subalgebra in the nonlinear realizationof $w_{1+\infty}$ symmetry, or by considering a nonlinear realization of someextended symmetry, or by combining both options. We show that all thesepossibilities give rise to the multi-field realizations of $w_{1+\infty}$. Wededuce the two-field realization of $w_{1+\infty}$ proceeding from a cosetspace of the symmetry group $\tilde{G}$ which is an extension of $w_{1+\infty}$by the second self-commuting set of higher spin currents. Next, starting withthe unextended $w_{1+\infty}$ but placing all its spin 2 generators into thecoset, we obtain a new two-field realization of $w_{1+\infty}$ whichessentially involves a $2D$ dilaton. In order to construct the invariant actionfor this system we add one more field and so get a new three-field realizationof $w_{1+\infty}$. We re-derive it within the coset space approach, by applyingthe latter to an extended symmetry group $\hat{G}$ which is a nonlineardeformation of $\tilde{G}$. Finally we present some multi-field generalizationsof our three-field realization and discuss several intriguing parallels with$N=2$ strings and conformal affine Toda theories.
