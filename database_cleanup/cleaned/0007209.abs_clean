We review general domain-wall solutions supported by a delta-function source,together with a single pure exponential scalar potential in supergravity. Thesescalar potentials arise from a sphere reduction in M-theory or string theory.There are several examples of flat (BPS) domain walls that lead to alocalisation of gravity on the brane, and for these we obtain the form of thecorrections to Newtonian gravity. These solutions are lifted back on certaininternal spheres to D=11 and D=10 as M-branes and D-branes. We find that thedomain walls that can trap gravity yield M-branes or Dp-branes that have anatural decoupling limit, i.e. p\le 5, with the delta-function source providingan ultra-violet cut-off in a dual quantum field theory. This suggests that thelocalisation of gravity can generally be realised within a Domain-wall/QFTcorrespondence, with the delta-function domain-wall source providing a cut-offfrom the space-time boundary for these domain-wall solutions. We also discussthe form of the one-loop corrections to the graviton propagator from theboundary QFT that would reproduce the corrections to the Newtonian gravity onthe domain wall.
