Title: Non-critical NSR string field theory and discrete states interaction in

2D supergravityAuthors: I.Ya.Aref'eva and A.P.Zubarev

String field theory for the non-critical NSR string is described. Inparticular it gives string field theory for the 2D super-gravity coupled to a$\hat{c}=1$ matter field. For this purpose double-step pictures changingoperators for the non-critical NSR string are constructed. Analogues of thecritical supersymmetry transformations are written for $D<10$, they form aclosed on-shell algebra, however their action on vertices is defined only fordiscrete value of the Liouville momentum. For D=2 this means that spinormassless field has its superpartner in the NS sector only if its momentum isfixed.Starting from string field theory we calculate string amplitudes. Theseamplitudes for D=2 have poles which are related with discrete set of primaryfields, namely 2R$\to$2R amplitude has poles corresponding to the n-level NSexcitations with discrete momenta $p_1=n,~~p_2=-1\pm (n+1)$.
