with N=3 supersymmetry and discussion of heterotic compactifications. Detailson conventions and references addedWe systematically analyse the necessary and sufficient conditions for thepreservation of supersymmetry for bosonic geometries of the form R^{1,9-d}\times M_d, in the common NS-NS sector of type II string theory and also typeI/heterotic string theory. The results are phrased in terms of the intrinsictorsion of G-structures and provide a comprehensive classification of staticsupersymmetric backgrounds in these theories. Generalised calibrationsnaturally appear since the geometries always admit NS or type I/heteroticfivebranes wrapping calibrated cycles. Some new solutions are presented. Inparticular we find d=6 examples with a fibred structure which preserve N=1,2,3supersymmetry in type II and include compact type I/heterotic geometries.
