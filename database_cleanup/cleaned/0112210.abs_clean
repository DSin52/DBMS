We review a method to find the non-abelian open superstring effective action,thereby settling the issue of the ordering ambiguities. We start from solutionsto Yang-Mills which, in D-brane context, define certain BPS configurations.Studying their deformations in the abelian case shows that the Born-Infeldaction is the unique deformation which admits solutions of this type. Byapplying the method to the non-abelian case we calculated the full effectiveaction through O(\alpha'^3). The presence of derivative terms turns out to beessential. Testing the result by comparing the spectrum in the presence of aconstant magnetic background field with the string theory prediction, we obtainperfect agreement.
