Title: Effective Average Actions and Nonperturbative Evolution Equations

Comments: 25 pages, latex

The effective average actions for gauge theories and the associatednonperturbative evolution equations which govern their renormalization groupflow are reviewed and various applications are described. As an example of atopological field theory, Chern-Simons theory is discussed in detail.
