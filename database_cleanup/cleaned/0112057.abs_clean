We extend a non local and non covariant version of the Thirring model inorder to describe a many-body system with backward and umklapp scatteringprocesses. We express the vacuum to vacuum functional in terms of a non trivialfermionic determinant. Using path-integral methods we find a bosonicrepresentation for this determinant which allows us to obtain an effectiveaction for the collective excitations of the system. By introducing a non localversion of the self-consistent harmonic approximation, we get an expression forthe gap of the charge-density excitations as functional of arbitraryelectron-electron potentials. As an example we also consider the case of a noncontact umklapp interaction.
