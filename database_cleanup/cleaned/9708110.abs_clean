Title: Duality and the Renormalization Group

Authors: Peter E. Haagensen

Comments: 16 pages, TeX. Invited talk presented at the NATO Workshop ``New

Developments in Quantum Field Theory'', Zakopane, Poland, June 14--20, 1997The requirement that duality and renormalization group transformationscommute as motions in the space of a theory has recently been explored toextract information about the renormalization flows in different statisticaland field theoretical systems. After a review of what has been accomplished inthe context of 2d sigma models, new results are presented which set up thestage for a fully generic calculation at two-loop order, with particularemphasis on the question of scheme dependence.
