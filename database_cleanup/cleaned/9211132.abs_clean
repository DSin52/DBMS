Recent interest in large N matrix models in the double scaling limit raisednew interest also in O(N) vector models. The limit $N \rightarrow \infty$,correlated with the limit $g \rightarrow g_c$, results in an expansion in termsof filamentary surfaces and explicit calculations can be carried out also indimensions $d\geq 2$. It is shown here that the absence of physical masslessbound states in two dimensions sets strong constraints on this limit.
