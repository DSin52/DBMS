Using the nonabelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action with the Wess-Zumino term thatis constructed in consistent with T duality we examine the Myers dielectriceffect for multiple D0-branes in the near-horizon geometry of D4-branes. Theeffect in the curved spacetime is also confirmed by the dual formulation basedon the abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action of a D2-brane. Putting a system ofmuliple D-strings in the external electric RR five-form flux, we construct anoncommutative non-BPS solution where the D-strings expand into a sphericalD3-brane. We discuss the external field dependence of the funnel-like orwormhole solution.
