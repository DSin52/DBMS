The chiral and scale anomalies of a very general class of non local Diracoperators are computed using the $\zeta$-function definition of the fermionicdeterminant. For the axial anomaly all new terms introduced by the non localityare shown to be removable by counterterms and such counterterms are alsoexplicitly computed. It is verified that the non local Dirac operators have thestandard minimal anomaly in Bardeen's form.
