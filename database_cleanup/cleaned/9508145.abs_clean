Title: The trigonometric counterpart of the Haldane Shastry Model

Comments: amslatex, 42 pages, discrepancies between amslatex 1.1 and newer

versions are rectified, two references are addedThe hierarchy of Integrable Spin Chain Hamiltonians, which are trigonometricanalogs of the Haldane Shastry Model and of the associated higher conservedcharges, is derived by a reduction from the trigonometric Dynamical Models ofBernard-Gaudin-Haldane-Pasquier. The Spin Chain Hamiltonians have the propertyof $U_q(\hat{gl}_2)$-invariance. The spectrum of the Hamiltonians and the$U_q(\hat{gl}_2)$-representation content of their eigenspaces are found by adescent from the Dynamical Models.
