Noncommutative ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Millstheories with gauge group U(N) are studied here using the background fieldmethod and superspace background covariant D-algebra in perturbation theory. Atone loop divergences arise only in the two-point functions. They arelogarithmic UV/IR divergences in the planar/nonplanar sectors that play a roledual to each other. We compute the planar and non planar contributions to thethree- and four-point functions with vector external lines. We find that thethree-point function vanishes, while the four-point function receivescontributions both from vector and from chiral matter loops.
