constant curvature in 2+1-D GravityComments: 17 pages Latex, 4 eps figures

Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B515 (1998) 436-452

In this paper we consider space-times containing matter expanding orcontracting according to a time-dependent scale factor. Cosmologies withvanishing, positive or negative cosmological constant are considered. In thecase of vanishing or negative cosmological constant open and closed spatialsurfaces are solutions while in the case of positive cosmological constant onlyclosed surfaces exist. The gravitational field is solved explicitly in the caseof 1 or 2 particles, 1 black-hole, and 1 black-hole vacuum state.
