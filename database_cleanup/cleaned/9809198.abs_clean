The existence of fluctuations together with interactions leads toscale-dependence in the couplings of quantum field theories for the case ofquantum fluctuations, and in the couplings of stochastic systems when thefluctuations are of thermal or statistical nature. In both cases the effects ofthese fluctuations can be accounted for by solutions of the correspondingrenormalization group equations. We show how the renormalization groupeffective action we can extract the renormalization group equations; given therenormalization group equations the effects of these fluctuations can beincluded in the classical action by using what is known as improvedperturbation theory (wherein the bare parameters appearing in tree-levelexpressions are replaced by their scale-dependent running forms). The improvedaction can then be used to reconstruct the effective action, up to finiterenormalizations, and gradient terms.
