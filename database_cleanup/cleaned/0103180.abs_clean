The response of a gravitational wave detector to scalar waves is analysed inthe framework of the debate on the choice of conformal frames for scalar-tensortheories. A correction to the geodesic equation arising in the Einsteinconformal frame modifies the geodesic deviation equation. This modification isdue to the non-metricity of the theory in the Einstein frame, yielding alongitudinal mode that is absent in the Jordan conformal frame.
