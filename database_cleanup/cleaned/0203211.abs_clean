We discuss construction of classical time dependent solutions in open string(field) theory, describing the motion of the tachyon on unstable D-branes.Despite the fact that the string field theory action contains infinite numberof time derivatives, and hence it is not a priori clear how to set up theinitial value problem, the theory contains a family of time dependent solutionscharacterized by the initial position and velocity of the tachyon field. Wewrite down the world-sheet action of the boundary conformal field theoriesassociated with these solutions and study the corresponding boundary states.For D-branes in bosonic string theory, the energy momentum tensor of the systemevolves asymptotically towards a finite limit if we push the tachyon in thedirection in which the potential has a local minimum, but hits a singularity ifwe push it in the direction where the potential is unbounded from below.
