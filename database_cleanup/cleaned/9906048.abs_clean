Title: Thermodynamics of D-brane Probes

Authors: E. Kiritsis, T.R. Taylor

Comments: 12 pages; Based on talks presented at the midterm meeting of the TMR

network "Physics beyond the standard model," held in Trieste in March 1999,and at the 1998 Corfu Summer Institute on Elementary Particle PhysicsWe discuss the dynamics and thermodynamics of particle and D-brane probesmoving in non-extremal black hole/brane backgrounds. When a probe falls fromasymptotic infinity to the horizon, it transforms its potential energy intoheat, $TdS$, which is absorbed by the black hole in a way consistent with thefirst law of thermodynamics. We show that the same remains true in thenear-horizon limit, for BPS probes only, with the BPS probe moving from AdSinfinity to the horizon. This is a quantitative indication that the brane-probereaching the horizon corresponds to thermalization in gauge theory. It is shownthat this relation provides a way to reliably compute the entropy away from theextremal limit (towards the Schwarzschild limit).
