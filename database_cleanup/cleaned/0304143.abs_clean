This thesis starts with a review of BPS M-branes and their supergravitysolutions. These solutions can be obtained in various ways. We describe theharmonic function rule and the Fayyazuddin-Smith metric ansatz in detail,illustrating both methods by examples of M-branes wrapping holomorphic curves.Another, simpler way, is to use calibrations. In order for a wrapped brane tobe BPS, the cycle it wraps must be calibrated; given the relevant calibration,there exists a procedure which yields the supergravity solution almostimmediately. In the past, this method was applied only to Kahler calibrations,as these were the only ones known to exist in backgrounds with non-trivialflux. We extend this method to a wider domain, using a constraint to classifypossible calibrations. A rule is given which can generate the requiredconstraint for any given M-brane wrapped on a holomorphic cycle. Ways in whichthis constraint can be satisfied are also discussed.
