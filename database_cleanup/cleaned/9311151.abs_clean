We construct the space of vector fields on quantum groups . Its elements areproducts of the known left invariant vector fields with the elements of thequantum group itself. We also study the duality between vector fields and1-forms. The construction is easily generalized to tensor fields. A Liederivative along any (also non left invariant) vector field is proposed. Theseresults hold for a generic Hopf algebra.
