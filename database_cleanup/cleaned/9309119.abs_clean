We consider $U(N)$ and $SU(N)$ gauge theory on the sphere. We express theproblem in terms of a matrix element of $N$ free fermions on a circle. Thisallows us to find an alternative way to show Witten's result that the partitionfunction is a sum over classical saddle points. We then show how the phasetransition of Douglas and Kazakov occurs from this point of view. Bygeneralizing the work of Douglas and Kazakov, we find other `stringy' solutionsfor the $U(N)$ case in the large $N$ limit. Each solution is described by a net$U(1)$ charge. We derive a relation for the maximum charge for a given area andwe also describe the critical behavior for these new solutions. Finally, wedescribe solutions for lattice $SU(N)$ which are in a sense dual to thecontinuum $U(N)$ solutions. (Parts of this paper were presented at the Strings'93 Workshop, Berkeley, May 1993.)
