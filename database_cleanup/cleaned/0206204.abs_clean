A pp-wave solution to 11-dimensional supergravity is given with precisely 26supercharges. Its uniqueness and the absence of 11-dimensional pp-waves whichpreserve (precisely) 28 or 30 supercharges is discussed. Compactification on aspacelike circle gives a IIA configuration with all 26 of the supercharges. Forthis compactification, D0 brane charge does not appear in the supersymmetryalgebra. Indeed, the 26 supercharge IIA background does not admit anysupersymmetric D-branes. In an appendix, a 28 supercharge IIB pp-wave ispresented along with its supersymmetry algebra.
