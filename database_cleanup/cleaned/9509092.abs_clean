It is demonstrated that the action of SU$(N)$ principal chiral model leads inthe limit $N \to {\infty}$ to the action for Husain's heavenly equation. Theprincipal chiral model in the Hilbert space $L^2(\Re^1)$ is considered and itis shown, that in this case the chiral equation is equivalent to the Moyaldeformation of Husain's heavenly equation. New method of searching forsolutions to this latter equation, via Lie algebra representations in$L^2(\Re^1)$ is given.
