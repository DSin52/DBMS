Recently the vacuum structure of a large class of four dimensional(supersymmetric) quantum field theories was determined exactly. These theoriesexhibit a wide range of interesting new physical phenomena. One of the main newinsights is the role of ``electric-magnetic duality.'' In its simplest form itdescribes the long distance behavior of some strongly coupled, and hencecomplicated, ``electric theories'' in terms of weakly coupled ``magnetictheories.'' This understanding sheds new light on confinement and the Higgsmechanism and uncovers new phases of four dimensional gauge theories. We reviewthese developments and speculate on the outlook.
