We give a microscopic description of extreme and near-extremeReissner-Nordstrom black holes in four dimensions in terms of fundamentalstrings in a background of magnetic five branes and monopoles. The stringoscillator numbers and tension are rescaled due to the Rindler space backgroundwith the string mass fixed. The entropy of the black holes is reproducedcorrectly by that of the string with the tension rescaling taken into account.
