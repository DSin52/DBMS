superpotentials and $\mu$-term generationWe consider solutions to the $\mu$-problem originating in the effective lowenergy theories, of N=1 orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string,after supersymmetry breaking. They are consistent with the invariance of theone loop corrected effective action in the linear representation of thedilaton. The proposed $\mu$-terms naturally generalize solutions proposedpreviously, in the literature, in the context of minimal low energysupergravity models. They emanate from the connection of the non-perturbativesuperpotential to the determinant of the mass matrix of the chiralcompactification modes. Within this approach we discuss the lifting of oursolutions to their M-theory compactification counterparts.
