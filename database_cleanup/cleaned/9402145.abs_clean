$U_q\widehat{s\ell}_2$ and lattice KdV variablesAuthors: B. Enriquez

We propose a quantum lattice version of Feigin and E. Frenkel'sconstructions, identifying the KdV differential polynomials with functions on ahomogeneous space under the nilpotent part of $\widehat{s\ell}_2$. We constructan action of the nilpotent part $U_q\widehat n_+$ of $U_q\widehat{s\ell}_2$ ontheir lattice counterparts, and embed the lattice variables in a $U_q\widehatn_+$-module, coinduced from a quantum version of the principal commutativesubalgebra, which is defined using the identification of $U_q\widehat n_+$ withits coordinate algebra.
