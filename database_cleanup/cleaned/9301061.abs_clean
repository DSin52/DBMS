I propose a new mathematical form for the quantum theory of gravity coupledto matter. The motivation is from the connection between CSW TQFT and theAshtekar variables. I also connect the algebraic structure of TQFT with somethoughts about the interpretation of quantum mechanics in a generalrelativistic setting.
