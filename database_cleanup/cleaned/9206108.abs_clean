The nonlinear scalar-field realisation of $w_{1+\infty}$ symmetry in $d=2$dimensions is studied in analogy to the nonlinear realisation of $d=4$conformal symmetry $SO(4,2)$. The $w_{1+\infty}$ realisation is derived from acoset-space construction in which the divisor group is generated by thenon-negative modes of the Virasoro algebra, with subsequent application of aninfinite set of covariant constraints. The initial doubly-infinite set ofGoldstone fields arising in this construction is reduced by the covariantconstraints to a singly-infinite set corresponding to the Cartan-subalgebragenerators $v^\ell_{-(\ell+1)}$. We derive the transformation rules of thissurviving set of fields, finding a triangular structure in which fieldstransform into themselves or into lower members of the set only. Thistriangular structure gives rise to finite-component subrealisations, includingthe standard one for a single scalar. We derive the Maurer-Cartan form anddiscuss the construction of invariant actions.
