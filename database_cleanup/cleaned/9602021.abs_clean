There are many physically interesting superconformal gauge theories in fourexistence of continuous families of infrared fixed points. Well-known examplesinclude finite ${\cal N}=4$ and ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric theories; manyfinite ${\cal N}=1$ examples are known also. These theories are a subset of amuch larger class, whose existence can easily be established and understoodusing the algebraic methods explained here. A relation between the ${\cal N}=1$duality of Seiberg and duality in finite ${\cal N}=2$ theories is found usingthis approach, giving further evidence for the former. This talk is based onwork with Robert Leigh (hep-th/9503121).
