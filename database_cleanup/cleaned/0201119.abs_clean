Title: Demonstration of how the zeta function method for effective potential

removes the divergencesAuthors: Jose Alexandre Nogueira and Adolfo Maia Jr

Comments: 9 pages

The calculation of the minimum of the effective potential using the zetafunction method is extremely advantagous, because the zeta function is regularat $s=0$ and we gain immediately a finite result for the effective potentialwithout the necessity of subtratction of any pole or the addition of infinitecounter-terms. The purpose of this paper is to explicitly point out how thecancellation of the divergences occurs and that the zeta function methodimplicitly uses the same procedure used by Bollini-Giambiagi andSalam-Strathdee in order to gain finite part of functions with a simple pole.
