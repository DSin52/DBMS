Title: Heat-kernel coefficients of the Laplace operator on the 3-dimensional

ballAuthors: K. Kirsten and M. Bordag

Comments: 7 pages, LaTex

We consider the heat-kernel expansion of the massive Laplace operator on thethree dimensional ball with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Using this example,we illustrate a very effective scheme for the calculation of an (in principle)arbitrary number of heat-kernel coefficients for the case where the basisfunctions are known. New results for the coefficients $B_{\frac 5 2},...,B_5$are presented.
