Continuum Virasoro constraints in the two-cut hermitian matrix models arederived from the discrete Ward identities by means of the mapping from the$GL(\infty )$ Toda hierarchy to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) hierarchy.The invariance of the string equation under the NLS flows is worked out. Alsothe quantization of the integration constant $\alpha$ reported by Hollowood etal. is explained by the analyticity of the continuum limit.
