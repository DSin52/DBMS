A Hamiltonian analysis of Yang-Mills (YM) theory in (2+1) dimensions with alevel $k$ Chern-Simons term is carried out using a gauge invariant matrixparametrization of the potentials. The gauge boson states are constructed andthe contribution of the dynamical mass gap to the gauge boson mass is obtained.Long distance properties of vacuum expectation values are related to aEuclidean two-dimensional YM theory coupled to $k$ flavors of Dirac fermions inthe fundamental representation. We also discuss the expectation value of theWilson loop operator and give a comparison with previous results.
