Title: Nonperturbative solution of supersymmetric gauge theories

Authors: J.R. Hiller

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX2e, ws-procs9x6; to appear in the proceedings of the

fifth workshop on Continuous Advances in QCD (Arkadyfest), Minneapolis,Minnesota, May 17-23, 2002Recent work on the numerical solution of supersymmetric gauge theories isdescribed. The method used is SDLCQ (supersymmetric discrete light-conequantization). An application to N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in 2+1dimensions at large N_c is summarized. The addition of a Chern-Simons term isalso discussed.
