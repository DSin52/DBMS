The precise relationship between the arbitrary monodromy dependent 2-formappearing in the chiral WZNW symplectic form and the `exchange r-matrix' thatgoverns the corresponding Poisson brackets is established. Generalizing earlierresults related to diagonal monodromy, the exchange r-matrices are shown tosatisfy a new dynamical generalization of the classical modified Yang-Baxterequation, which is found to admit an interpretation in terms of (new)Poisson-Lie groupoids. Dynamical exchange r-matrices for which rightmultiplication yields a classical or a Poisson-Lie symmetry on the chiral WZNWphase space are presented explicitly.
