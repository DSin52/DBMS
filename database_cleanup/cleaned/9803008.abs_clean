In recent times some interesting field theoretical descriptions of thestatistical mechanics of entangling polymers have been proposed by variousauthors. In these approaches, a single test polymer fluctuating in a backgroundof static polymers or in a lattice of obstacles is considered. The extension tothe case in which the configurations of two or more polymers become non-staticis not straightforward unless their trajectories are severely constrained. Inthis paper we present another approach, based on Chern--Simons field theory,which is able to describe the topological entanglements of two fluctuatingpolymers in terms of gauge fields and second quantized replica fields.
