Highest weight representations of $U_q(su(1,1))$ with $q=\exp \pi i/N$ areinvestigated. The structures of the irreducible hieghesat weight modules arediscussed in detail. The Clebsch-Gordan decomposition for the tensor product oftwo irreducible representations is discussed. By using the results, arepresentation of $SL(2,R)\otimes U_q(su(2))$ is also presented in terms ofholomorphic sections which also have $U_q(su(2))$ index. Furthermore we realise$Z_N$-graded supersymmetry in terms of the representation. An explicitrealization of $Osp(1 \vert 2)$ via the heighest weight representation of$U_q(su(1,1))$ with $q^2=-1$ is given.
