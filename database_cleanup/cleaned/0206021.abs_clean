A gauged $SU_q(2)$ theory is characterized by two dual algebras, the firstlying close to the Lie algebra of SU(2) while the second introduces new degreesof freedom that may be associated with non-locality or solitonic structure. Thefirst and second algebras, here called the external and internal algebrasrespectively, define two sets of fields, also called external and internal. Thegauged external fields agree with the Weinberg-Salam model at the level of thedoublet representation but differ at the level of the adjoint representation.For example the g-factor of the charged W-boson differs in the two models. Thegauged internal fields remain speculative but are analogous to color fields.
