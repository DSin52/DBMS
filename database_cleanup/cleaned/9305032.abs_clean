A method to obtain explicit and complete topological solution of SU(2)Chern-Simons theory on $S^3$ is developed. To this effect the necessary aspectsof the theory of coloured-oriented braids and duality properties of conformalblocks for the correlators of $SU(2)_k$ Wess-Zumino conformal field theory arepresented. A large class of representations of the generators of the groupoidof coloured-oriented braids are obtained. These provide a whole lot of new linkinvariants of which Jones polynomials are the simplest examples. These newinvariants are explicitly calculated as illustrations for knots upto eightcrossings and two-component multicoloured links upto seven crossings.
