Using strong-coupling quantum field theory we calculate highly accuratecritical exponents nu, eta from new seven-loop expansions in three dimensions.Our theoretical value for the critical exponent alpha of the specific heat nearthe lambda-point of superfluid helium is alpha =-0.01294+-0.00060, in excellentagreement with the space shuttle experimental value alpha =-0.01285+-0.00038.
