Charged scalar field is quantized in the background of a static d-2 - branewhich is a core of the magnetic flux lines in flat d+1 - dimensionalspace-time. We find that vector potential of the magnetic core induces theenergy-momentum tensor in the vacuum. The tensor components are periodicfunctions of the brane flux and holomorphic functions of space dimension. Thedependence on the distance from the brane and on the coupling to the space-timecurvature scalar is comprehensively analysed.
