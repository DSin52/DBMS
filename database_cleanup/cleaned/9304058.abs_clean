I consider a Langevin equation with field-dependent kernels and investigatesupersymmetry of the stochastic generating functional constructed from theLangevin equation. Moreover I describe the stochastic generating functional interms of a superfield. In the superfield formalism, it becomes clear that thestochastic quantization method with the field-dependent kernel is equivalent tothe path-integral quantization method.
