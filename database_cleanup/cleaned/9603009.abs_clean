We discuss the relation between M theory and type II string theories. We showthat, assuming ``natural'' interactions between membranes and fivebranes in Mtheory, the known interactions between strings and D-branes in type II stringtheories arise in appropriate limits. Our discussion of the interactions ispurely at the classical level. We remark on issues associated with the M theoryapproach to enhanced gauge symmetries, which deserve further investigation.
