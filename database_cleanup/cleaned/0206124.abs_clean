We study a generalization of the group of loops based on sets of signedpoints, instead of paths or loops. This geometrical setting incorporates thekinematical constraints of the Sigma Model, inasmuch as the the group of loopsdoes with the Bianchi identities of Yang-Mills theories. We employ an Abelianversion of this construction to quantize the Self-Dual Model, which allows usto relate this theory with that of a massless scalar field obeying non-trivialboundary conditions.
