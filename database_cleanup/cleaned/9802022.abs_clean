Recently, we have studied the general Virasoro construction at one loop inthe background of the general non-linear sigma model. Here, we find the actionformulation of these new conformal field theories when the background sigmamodel is itself conformal. In this case, the new conformal field theories aredescribed by a large class of new spin-two gauged sigma models. As examples ofthe new actions, we discuss the spin-two gauged WZW actions, which describe theconformal field theories of the generic affine-Virasoro construction, and thespin-two gauged g/h coset constructions. We are able to identify the latter asthe actions of the local Lie h-invariant conformal field theories, a largeclass of generically irrational conformal field theories with a local gaugesymmetry.
