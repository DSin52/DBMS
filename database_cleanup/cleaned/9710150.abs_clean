We discuss new bounce-like (but non-time-reversal-invariant-) solutions toEuclidean equations of motion, which we dub boomerons. In the Euclidean pathintegral approach to quantum theories, boomerons make an imaginary contributionto the vacuum energy. The fake vacuum instabilty can be removed by cancellingboomeron contributions against contributions from time reversed boomerons(anti-boomerons). The cancellation rests on a sign choice whose significance isnot completely understood in the path integral method.
