We present new anti-de Sitter black hole solutions of gauged N=8, SO(8)supergravity, which is the massless sector of the AdS_4\times S^7 vacuum ofM-theory. By focusing on the U(1)^4 Cartan subgroup, we find non-extremal 1, 2,3 and 4 charge solutions. In the extremal limit, they may preserve up to 1/2,1/4, 1/8 and 1/8 of the supersymmetry, respectively. In the limit of vanishingSO(8) coupling constant, the solutions reduce to the familiar black holes ofthe M_4\times T^7 vacuum, but have very different interpretation since thereare no winding states on S^7 and no U-duality. In contrast to the T^7compactification, moreover, we find no static multi-center solutions. Also incontrast, the S^7 fields appear "already dualized" so that the 4 charges may beall electric or all magnetic rather than 2 electric and 2 magnetic. Curiously,however, the magnetic solutions preserve no supersymmetries. We conjecture thata subset of the extreme electric black holes preserving 1/2 the supersymmetrymay be identified with the S^7 Kaluza-Klein spectrum, with the non-abelianSO(8) quantum numbers provided by the fermionic zero modes.
