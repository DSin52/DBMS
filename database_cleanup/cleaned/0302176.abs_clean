Title: On the invariant measure for the Yang-Mills configuration space in (3+1)

dimensionsComments: LaTeX, 14 pages

We consider a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian analysis for Yang-Mills theories inthree spatial dimensions. The gauge potentials are parametrized in terms of amatrix variable which facilitates the elimination of the gauge degrees offreedom. We develop an approximate calculation of the volume element on thegauge-invariant configuration space, pointing out features related todimensional transmutation.
