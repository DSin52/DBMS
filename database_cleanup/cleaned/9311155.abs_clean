In this paper we develop a theory for constructing an invariant of closedoriented 3-manifolds, given a certain type of Hopf algebra. Examples are givenby a quantised enveloping algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra, or by asemisimple involutory Hopf algebra. The invariant is defined by a state summodel on a triangulation. In some cases, the invariant is the partitionfunction of a topological quantum field theory.
