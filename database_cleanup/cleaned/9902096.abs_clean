We obtain a generally covariant conservation law of energy-momentum forgravitational anyons by the general displacement transform. The energy-momentumcurrents have also superpotentials and are therefore identically conserved. Itis shown that for Deser's solution and Clement's solution, the energy vanishes.The reasonableness of the definition of energy-momentum may be confirmed by thesolution for pure Einstein gravity which is a limit of vanishing Chern-Simonscoulping of gravitational anyons.
