In recent work, it was shown that velocity-dependent forces between parallelfundamental strings moving apart in a D-dimensional spacetime implied anexpanding universe in D-1-dimensional spacetime. Here we expand on this work toobtain exact solutions for various string/brane cosmological toy models.
