We investigate the tachyon-dilaton-metric system to study the "graceful exit"problem in string theoretic inflation, where tachyon plays the role of thescalar field. From the phase space analysis, we find that the inflationaryphase does not smoothly connect to a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) expandinguniverse, thereby providing a simple tachyonic extension of the recently provedstringy no-go theorem.
