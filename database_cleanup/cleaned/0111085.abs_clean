We study branes moving in an AdS Schwarzschild black hole background. Whenthe brane tension exceeds a critical value, the induced metric on the brane isof FRW type and asymptotically de Sitter. We discuss the relevance of suchconfigurations to dS/CFT correspondence. When the black hole mass reaches acritical value that depends on the brane tension, the brane interpolates in theinfinite past and future between a dS space and a finite space of zero Hubbleconstant. This corresponds to a cosmological evolution without a Big Bang or aBig Crunch. Moreover, the central charge of the CFT dual to the dS brane entersthe Cardy-Verlinde formula that gives the entropy of the thermal CFT dual tothe bulk AdS black hole.
