In this paper we construct explicitly an infinite number of Hopfions (static,soliton solutions with non-zero Hopf topological charges) within the recentlyproposed 3+1-dimensional, integrable and relativistically invariant fieldtheory. Two integers label the family of Hopfions we have found. Their productis equal to the Hopf charge which provides a lower bound to the soliton'sfinite energy. The Hopfions are constructed explicitly in terms of the toroidalcoordinates and shown to have a form of linked closed vortices.
