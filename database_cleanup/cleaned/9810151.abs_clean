Title: The Graviton in the AdS-CFT correspondence

Boundary value problemAuthors: W. M\"uck and K. S. Viswanathan

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX2e with amsmath, amsfonts packages

Using the AdS-CFT correspondence we calculate the two point function of CFTenergy momentum tensors. The AdS gravitons are considered by explicitlysolving the Dirichlet boundary value problem for $x_0=\epsilon$. We considerthis treatment as complementary to existing work, with which we make contact.
