In this work we consider the action for a set of complex scalarsupermultiplets interacting with the scale factor in the supersymmetriccosmological models. We show that the local conformal supersymmetry leads to ascalar field potential defined in terms of the K\"ahler potential andsuperpotential. Using supersymmetry breaking we are able to obtain anormalizable wave function for the FRW cosmological model.
