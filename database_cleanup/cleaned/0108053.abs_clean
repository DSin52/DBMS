We consider the Casimir energy of a thick dielectric-diamagnetic shell undera uniform velocity light condition, as a function of the radii and thepermeabilities. We show that there is a range of parameters in which the stresson the outer shell is inward, and a range where the stress on the outer shellis outward. We examine the possibility of obtaining an energetically stableconfiguration of a thick shell made of a material with a fixed volume.
