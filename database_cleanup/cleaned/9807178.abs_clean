In previous work, the conformal-gauge two-dimensional quantum gravity in theBRS formalism has been solved completely in terms of Wightman functions. In thepresent paper, this result is extended to the closed and open bosonic stringsof finite length; the open-string case is nothing but the Kato-Ogawa stringtheory. The field-equation anomaly found previously, which means a slightviolation of a field equation at the level of Wightman functions, remainsexistent also in the finite-string cases. By using this fact, a BRS chargenilpotent even for $D\not=26$ is explicitly constructed in the framework of theKato-Ogawa string theory. The FP-ghost vacuum structure of the Kato-Ogawatheory is made more transparent; the appearance of half-integral ghost numbersand the artificial introduction of indefinite metric are avoided.
