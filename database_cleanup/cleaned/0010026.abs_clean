theory in the B-field background. The rotation used in our previous papers todiscuss the scalar field by transforming the BPS equation into a linear one isextended to the case of gauge field. We also find that this transformation is asymmetry of the action. Moreover using the Legendre-dual formalism we present asimple expression of the BPS equation.
