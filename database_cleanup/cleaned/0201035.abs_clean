We present a construction of open-closed string field theory based on discand RP2 geometries. Finding an appropriate BRS operator in the case of the RP2geometry, we generalize the background independent open string field theory (orboundary string field theory) of Witten on a unit disc. The coupling constantflow at the closed string side is driven by the scalar operator inserted at thenontrivial loop of RP2. We discuss the off-shell extension of theboundary/crosscap states. Our construction provides an interpolation oforientifold planes of various dimensions as well as that of D-branes.
