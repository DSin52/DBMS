It is shown that the operator methods of supersymmetric quantum mechanics andthe concept of shape invariance can profitably be used to derive properties ofspherical harmonics in a simple way. The same operator techniques can also beapplied to several problems with non-central vector and scalar potentials. Asexamples, we analyze the bound state spectra of an electron in a Coulomb plusan Aharonov-Bohm field and/or in the magnetic field of a Dirac monopole.
