Title: Polynomial identities of the Rogers--Ramanujan type

Comments: 27 pages

Presented are polynomial identities which imply generalizations of Euler andRogers--Ramanujan identities. Both sides of the identities can be interpretedas generating functions of certain restricted partitions. We prove theidentities by establishing a graphical one-to-one correspondence between thosetwo kinds of restricted partitions.
