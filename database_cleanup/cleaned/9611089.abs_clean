We show that locally Lorentz invariant, third order, topological massivegravity can not be broken down neither to the local diffeomorphism subgroup norto the rigid Poincar\'e group. On the other hand, the recently formulated,locally diffeomorphism invariant, second order massive triadic (translational)Chern-Simons gravity breaks down on rigid Minkowski space to a double massivespin-two system. This flat double massive action is the uniform spin-twogeneralization of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca system which one is left withafter U(1) abelian gauge invariance breaks down in the presence of a sexticHiggs potential.
