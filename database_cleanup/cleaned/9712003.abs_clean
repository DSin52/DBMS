Title: Field Correlators in the Georgi-Glashow Model and Several Aspects of its

String RepresentationComments: 6 pages, LaTeX, no figures, a reference is added

String representations of the Wilson loop and of the non-Abelian analog ofthe 't Hooft loop, defined on the string world-sheet, are studied in theLondons' limit of the 4D Georgi-Glashow model. In the first case, massive gaugebosons yield only perimeter type terms, whereas in the second case, they alsointeract with the string, which enables one to derive the coefficient functionsparametrizing the bilocal correlator of the dual field strength tensors. Theasymptotic behaviours of these functions at small and large distances areargued to be in a good agreement with the observable lattice data.
