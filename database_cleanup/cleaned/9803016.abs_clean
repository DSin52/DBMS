Authors: Monica Borunda, M. Ruiz-Altaba

Comments: aipproclatex file, Review talk given by M. Borunda at the VI Workshop

in Particles and Fields, Morelia, Mexico, Nov. 97 references addedWe compute the amount of inflation required to solve the horizon problem ofcosmology in the pre-big-bang scenario. First we give a quick overview ofstring cosmology as developed by Veneziano and collaborators. Then we show thatthe amount of inflation in this background solves the horizon problem. Wediscuss fine-tuning.
