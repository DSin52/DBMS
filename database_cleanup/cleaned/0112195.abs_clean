Title: N=2 four-dimensional gauge theories from fractional branes

Authors: M. Bertolini, P. Di Vecchia and R. Marotta

Comments: 44 pages, AMS-LaTeX, no figures

This is a pedagogical and extended version of the results published in Refs.[1,2] and presented by the authors in various talks during the last year. Wediscuss the type II D-branes (both regular and fractional) of the orbifoldR^{1,5}*R^4/Z_2, we determine their corresponding supergravity solution andshow how this can be used to study the properties of N=2 super Yang-Mills.Supergravity is able to reproduce the perturbative moduli space of the gaugetheory, while it does not encode the non-perturbative corrections. The shortdistance region of space-time, which corresponds to the infrared region of thegauge theory, is excised by an enhancon mechanism, and more states should beincluded in the low energy effective action in order to enter inside theenhancon and recover the instanton corrections.
