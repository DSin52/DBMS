We present an integrable Hamiltonian which describes the sinh-Gordon model onthe half line coupled to a non-linear oscillator at the boundary. We explainhow we apply Sklyanin's formalism to a dynamical reflection matrix to obtainthis model. This method can be applied to couple other integrable fieldtheories to dynamical systems at the boundary. We also show how to find thedynamical solution of the quantum reflection equation corresponding to ourparticular example.
