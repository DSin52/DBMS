By diagonalizing the three-string vertex and using a special coordinaterepresentation the matter part of the open superstring star is identified withthe continuous Moyal product of functions of anti-commuting variables. We showthat in this representation the identity and sliver have simple expressions.The relation with the half-string fermionic variables in continuous basis isgiven.
