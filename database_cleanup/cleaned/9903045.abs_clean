Within the context of a super-critical (Liouville) string, we discuss(target-space) two-dimensional string cosmology. A numerical analysis indicatesthat the identification of time with the Liouville mode results in an expandinguniverse with matter which exhibits an inflationary phase, and `graceful exit'from it, tending asymptotically to a flat-metric fixed point.This fixed pointis characterized by a dilaton configuration which, depending on the initialconditions, either decreases linearly with the cosmic time, or is a finiteconstant. This implies that, in contrast to the critical string case, thestring coupling remains bounded during the exit from the inflationary phase,and, thus, the pertinent dynamics can be reliably described in terms of atree-level string effective action. The r\^ole of matter in inducing suchphenomena is emphasized. It is also interesting to note that the asymptoticvalue of the vacuum energy, which in the $\sigma$-model framework is identifiedwith the `running' central charge deficit, depends crucially on the set ofinitial conditions. Thus, although preliminary, this toy model seems to shareall the features expected to characterize a phenomenologically acceptablecosmological string model.
