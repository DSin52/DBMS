The Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge theory with charged scalar fields is analyzedat two loop level. The effective potential for the scalar fields is derived inthe closed form, and studied both analytically and numerically. It is shownthat the U(1) symmetry is spontaneously broken in the massless scalar theory.Dimensional transmutation takes place in the Coleman-Weinberg limit in whichthe Maxwell term vanishes. We point out the subtlety in defining the pureChern-Simons scalar electrodynamics and show that the Coleman-Weinberg limitmust be taken after renormalization. Renormalization group analysis of theeffective potential is also given at two loop.
