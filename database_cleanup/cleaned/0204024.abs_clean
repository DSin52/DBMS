By considering the Higgs mechanism in the framework of a parity-preservingPlanar Quantum Electrodynamics, one shows that an attractive electron-electroninteraction may come out. The e-e interaction potential emerges as thenon-relativistic limit of the Moller scattering amplitude and it may resultattractive with a suitable choice of parameters. Numerical values of the e-ebinding energy are obtained by solving the two-dimensional Schrodingerequation. The existence of bound states is to be viewed as an indicative thatthis model may be adopted to address the pairing mechanism in some systemsendowed with parity-preservation.
