We address the problem of computing scattering amplitudes related to thecorrelation function of two Wilson lines and/or loops elongated alonglight-cone directions in strongly coupled gauge theories. Using the AdS/CFTcorrespondence in the classical approximation, the amplitudes are shown to berelated to minimal surfaces generalizing the {\em helicoid} in various $AdS_5$backgrounds. Infra-red divergences appearing for Wilson lines can be factorizedout or can be cured by considering the IR finite case of correlation functionsof two Wilson loops. In non-conformal cases related to confining theories,reggeized amplitudes with linear trajectories and unit intercept are obtainedand shown to come from the approximately flat metrics near the horizon, whichsets the scale for the Regge slope. In the conformal case the absence ofconfinement leads to a different solution. A transition between both regimesappears, in a confining theory, when varying impact parameter.
