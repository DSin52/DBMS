Higher derivative terms are computed in the one-loop effective actionN=2 supersymmetry preserved off-shell, and (2) in the standard background fieldformalism, with only on-shell supersymmetry. It is shown that thesecalculations only agree using tree-level equations of motion. The off-shellsupersymmetric calculation exhibits acceleration terms that appear in termswith four derivatives. These may imply disagreement at two-loop order betweensupergravity and Yang-Mills descriptions of D-brane dynamics.
