We find an analytic solution of the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE) for thespecial case of a finite XXZ spin chain with free boundary conditions and witha complex surface field which provides for $U_q(sl(2))$ symmetry of theHamiltonian. More precisely, we find one nontrivial solution, corresponding tothe ground state of the system with anisotropy parameter $\Delta = {1/2}$corresponding to $q^3 = -1$.
