We construct a non-perturbative method to investigate the phase structure ofthe scalar theory at finite temperature. The derivative of the effectivepotential with respect to the mass square is expressed in terms of the fullpropagator. Under a certain approximation this expression reduces to thepartial differential equation for the effective potential. We numerically solvethe partial differential equation and obtain the effective potentialnon-perturbatively. It is found that the phase transition is of the secondorder. The critical exponents calculated in this method are consistent with theresults obtained in Landau approximation.
