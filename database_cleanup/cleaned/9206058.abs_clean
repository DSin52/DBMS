The self-duality equations for the Riemann tensor are studied using theAshtekar Hamiltonian formulation for general relativity. These equations may bewritten as dynamical equations for three divergence free vector fields on athree dimensional surface in the spacetime. A simplified form of theseequations, describing metrics with a one Killing field symmetry are writtendown, and it shown that a particular sector of these equations has aHamiltonian form where the Hamiltonian is an arbitrary function on atwo-surface. In particular, any element of the $w_\infty$ algebra may be chosenas a the Hamiltonian.  For a special choice of this Hamiltonian, an infiniteset of solutions of the self-duality equations are given. These solutions areparametrized by elements of the $w_\infty$ algebra, which in turn leads to anexplicit form of four dimensional complex self-dual metrics that are in one toone correspondence with elements of this algebra.
