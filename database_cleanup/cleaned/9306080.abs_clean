It is well-known that topological sigma-models in 2 dimensions constitute apath-integral approach to the study of holomorphic maps from a Riemann surfaceS to an almost complex manifold K, the most interesting case being that where Kis a Kahler manifold. We show that, in the same way, topological sigma-modelsin 4 dimensions introduce a path integral approach to the study ofalmost quaternionic manifold N. The most interesting cases are those where M, Nare hyperKahler or quaternionic Kahler. BRST-cohomology translates intointersection theory in the moduli-space of this new class of instantonic maps,named by us hyperinstantons. The definition of triholomorphicity that wepropose is expressed by the equation q_*-J_u q_* j_u = 0, u=1,2,3, where {j_u}is an almost quaternionic structure on M and {J_u} is an almost quaternionicstructure on N. This is a generalization of the Cauchy-Fueter equations. For M,N hyperKahler, this generalization naturally arises by obtaining thetopological sigma-model as a twisted version of the N=2 globally supersymmetricsigma-model. We discuss various examples of hyperinstantons, in particular onthe torus and the K3 surface. We also analyse the coupling of the topologicalsigma-model to topological gravity. The study of
