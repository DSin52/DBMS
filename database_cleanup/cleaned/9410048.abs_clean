A new Lax equation is introduced for the KP hierarchy which avoids the use ofpseudo-differential operators, as used in the Sato approach. This Lax equationis closer to that used in the study of the dispersionless KP hierarchy, and isobtained by replacing the Poisson bracket with the Moyal bracket. Thedispersionless limit, underwhich the Moyal bracket collapses to the Poissonbracket, is particularly simple.
