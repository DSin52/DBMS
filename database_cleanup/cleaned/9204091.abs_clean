Title: Virasoro Representations on (Diff S1)/S1 Coadjoint Orbits

Authors: Washington Taylor IV

Comments: 36 pages

A new set of realizations of the Virasoro algebra on a bosonic Fock space arefound by explicitly computing the Virasoro representations associated withcoadjoint orbits of the form (Diff S1) / S1. Some progress is made inunderstanding the unitary structure of these representations. The characters ofthese representations are exactly the bosonic partition functions calculatedpreviously by Witten using perturbative and fixed-point methods. Therepresentations corresponding to the discrete series of unitary Virasororepresentations with c <= 1 are found to be reducible in this formulation,confirming a conjecture by Aldaya and Navarro-Salas.
