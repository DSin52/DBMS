Projecting a non-Abelian SU(2) vacuum gauge field - a pure gauge constructedfrom the group element U - onto a fixed (electromagnetic) direction in isospacegives rise to a nontrivial magnetic field, with nonvanishing magnetic helicity,which coincides with the winding number of U. Although the helicity is notconserved under Maxwell (vacuum) evolution, it retains one-half its initialvalue at infinite time.
