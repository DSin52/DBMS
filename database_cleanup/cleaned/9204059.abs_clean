Path-integral for theories with degenerate vacua is investigated. The originof the non Borel-summability of the perturbation theory is studied. A newprescription to deal with small coupling is proposed. It leads to a series,which at low orders and small coupling differs from the ordinary perturbativeseries by nonperturbative amount, but is Borel-summable.
