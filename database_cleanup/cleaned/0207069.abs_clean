A technique for avoiding infinite integrals in the calculation of theone-loop diagram contribution to the vacuum polarization component of an atomicenergy level is presented. This makes renormalization unnecessary. Infiniteintegrals do not occur because, as it is shown, no delta functions are requiredfor the Green's functions. Thus there are none to overlap. This procedure isshown to produce the same formula as the one obtained by dimensionalrenormalization.
