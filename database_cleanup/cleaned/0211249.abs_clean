We study the corrections induced by a baryon vertex to the superpotential ofSQCD with gauge group SU(N) and N quark flavors. We first compute thecorrections order by order using a standard field theory technique and derivethe corresponding glueball superpotential by "integrating in" the glueballfield. The structure of the corrections matches with the expectations from therecently introduced perturbative techniques. We then compute the firstnon-trivial contribution using this new technique and find exact quantitativeagreement. This involves cancellations between diagrams that go beyond theplanar approximation.
