We extend the notion of self-duality to spaces built from a set ofrepresentations of the Lorentz group with bosonic or fermionic behaviour, nothaving the traditional spin-one upper-bound of super Minkowski space. Thegeneralized derivative vector fields on such superspaces are assumed to form asuperalgebra. Introducing corresponding gauge potentials and hence covariantderivatives and curvatures, we define generalized self-duality as the Lorentzcovariant vanishing of certain irreducible parts of the curvatures.
