Title: Glueing operation for r-matrices, quantum groups and link-invariants of

Hecke typeComments: 36 pages

We introduce an associative glueing operation $\oplus_q$ on the space ofsolutions of the Quantum Yang-Baxter Equations of Hecke type. The correspondingglueing operations for the associated quantum groups and quantum vector spacesare also found. The former involves $2\times 2$ quantum matrices whose entriesare themselves square or rectangular quantum matrices. The correspondingglueing operation for link-invariants is introduced and involves a state-summodel with Boltzmann weights determined by the link invariants to be glued. Thestandard $su(n)$ solution, its associated quantum matrix group, quantum spaceand link-invariant arise at once by repeated glueing of the one-dimensionalcase.
