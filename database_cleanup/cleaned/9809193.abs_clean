The greybody factors in BTZ black holes are evaluated from 2D CFT in thespirit of AdS$_3$/CFT correspondence. The initial state of black holes in theusual calculation of greybody factors by effective CFT is described asPoincar\'{e} vacuum state in 2D CFT. The normalization factor which cannot befixed in the effective CFT without appealing to string theory is shown to bedetermined by the normalized bulk-to-boundary Green function. The relationamong the greybody factors in different dimensional black holes is exhibited.Two kinds of $(h,{\bar h})=(1,1)$ operators which couple with the boundaryvalue of massless scalar field are discussed.
