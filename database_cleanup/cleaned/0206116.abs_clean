In the lightcone frame, where the supermembrane theory and the Matrix modelare strikingly similar, the equations of motion admit an elegantcomplexification in even dimensional spaces. Although the explicit rotationalsymmetry of the target space is lost, the remaining unitary symmetries apartfrom providing a simple and unifying description of all known solutions suggestnew ones for rotating spherical and toroidal membranes. In this framework theangular momentum is represented by U(1) charges which balance the nonlinearattractive forces of the membrane. We examine in detail a six dimensionalrotating toroidal membrane solution which lives in a 3-torus, $T^3$ and admitsstable radial modes. In Matrix Theory it corresponds to a toroidal N-$D_{0}$brane bound state. We demonstrate its existence and discuss its radialstability.
