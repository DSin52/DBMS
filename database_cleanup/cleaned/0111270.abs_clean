Correspondence between BRST-BFV, Dirac and refined algebraic (groupaveraging, projection operator) approaches to quantize constrained systems isanalyzed. For the closed-algebra case, it is shown that the component of theBFV wave function with maximal (minimal) number of ghosts and antighosts in theSchrodinger representation may be viewed as a wave function in the refinedalgebraic (Dirac) quantization approach. The Giulini-Marolf group averagingformula for the inner product in the refined algebraic quantization approach isobtained from the Batalin-Marnelius prescription for the BRST-BFV inner productwhich should be generally modified due to topological problems. The consideredprescription for the correspondence of states is observed to be applicable tothe open-algebra case. Refined algebraic quantization approach is generalizedthen to the case of nontrivial structure functions. A simple example isdiscussed. Correspondence of observables in different quantization methods isalso investigated.
