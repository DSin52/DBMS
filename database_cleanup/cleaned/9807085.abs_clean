We give a reinterpretation of the matrix theory discussed by Moore, Nekrasovand Shatashivili (MNS) in terms of the second quantized operators whichdescribes the homology class of the Hilbert scheme of points on surfaces. Itnaturally relate the contribution from each pole to the inner product oforthogonal basis of free boson Fock space. These basis can be related to theeigenfunctions of Calogero-Sutherland (CS) equation and the deformationparameter of MNS is identified with coupling of CS system. We discuss thestructure of Virasoro symmetry in this model.
