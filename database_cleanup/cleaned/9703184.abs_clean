The interaction of a spin 1/2 particle (described by the non-relativistic"Dirac" equation of L\'evy-Leblond) with Chern-Simons gauge fields is studied.It is shown, that similarly to the four dimensional spinor models, there is aconsistent possibility of coupling them also by axial or chiral type currents.Static self dual vortex solutions together with a vortex-lattice are found withthe new couplings.
