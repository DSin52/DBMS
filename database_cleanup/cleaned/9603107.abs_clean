A string-like model with the "cosmological constant" $\Lambda$ is considered.The Maki-Shiraishi multi-black-hole solution \cite{MS1} is generalized tospace-times with a Ricci-flat internal space. For $\Lambda = 0$ the obtainedsolution in the one-black-hole case is shown to coincide with the extreme limitof the charged dilatonic black hole solution \cite{BI,BM}. The Hawkingtemperature $T_H$ for the solution \cite{BI,BM} is presented and its extremelimit is considered. For the string value of dilatonic coupling the temperature$T_H$ does not depend upon the internal space dimension.
