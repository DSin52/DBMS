honor of Marc Henneaux, October 2001, BrusselsIn a preceding report (hep-th/0112261), Pierre Ramond outlined a programme wehave followed recently. An important ingredient in a future unique theory forbasic physics must be a unique mathematical structure. It is then interestingto investigate the underlying mathematical structure of 11-dimensionalspace-time. A search for exceptional group structures specific to elevendimensions leads us then to a study of the coset F_4/SO(9),which may provide ageneralization of eleven-dimensional supergravity. This scheme is more generalthough and in this report we will show the corresponding structure related tothe coset SU(3)/SU(2) x U(1), where we interpret the U(1) as the helicity groupin four dimensions.
