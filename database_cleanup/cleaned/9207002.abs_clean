We study the implications of duality symmetry on the analyticity propertiesof the partition function as it depends upon the compactification length. Inorder to obtain non-trivial compactifications, we give a physical prescriptionto get the Helmholtz free energy for any heterotic string supersymmetric ornot. After proving that the free energy is always invariant under the dualitytransformation $R\rightarrow \alpha^{'}/(4R)$ and getting the zero temperaturetheory whose partition function corresponds to the Helmholtz potential, we showthat the self-dual point $R_{0}=\sqrt{\alpha^{'}}/2$ is a generic singularityas the Hagedorn one. The main difference between these two criticalcompactification radii is that the term producing the singularity at theself-dual point is finite for any $R \neq R_{0}$. We see that this behavior at$R_{0}$ actually implies a loss of degrees of freedom below that point.
