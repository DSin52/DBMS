We list the spectrum generating algebras for string theory and M-theorycompactified on various backgrounds of the form $AdS_{d+1} \times S^n$. Weidentify the representations of these algebras which make up the classicalsupergravity spectra and argue for the presence of these spectrum generatingalgebras in the classical string/M-theory. We also discuss the role of thespectrum generating algebras on the conformal field theory side.
