We present a model in which a gauge symmetry of a field theory is intrinsicin the geometry of an extended space time itself. A consequence is that thedimension of our space time is restricted through the BRS cohomology. If theHilbert space is a dense subspace of the space of all square integrable$C^{\infty}$ functions, the BRS cohomology classes are nontrivial only when thedimension is two or four.
