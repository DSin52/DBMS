We study N=4 supersymmetric quantum-mechanical many-body systems with Mbosonic and 4M fermionic degrees of freedom. We also investigate the furtherrestrictions of conformal and superconformal invariance. In particular, weconstruct conformal N=4 extensions of the A_{M-1} Calogero models, which forgeneric values of the coupling constant are not SU(1,1|2) superconformal. Thisclass of models is also extended to arbitrary (even) N. We give bothhamiltonian and (classical) lagrangean formulations. In the latter case we useboth component and N=4 superfield formulations.
