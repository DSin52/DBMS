We use the gauged linear sigma model introduced by Witten to calculateinstanton expansions for correlation functions in topological sigma models withtarget space a toric variety $V$ or a Calabi--Yau hypersurface $M \subset V$.In the linear model the instanton moduli spaces are relatively simple objectsand the correlators are explicitly computable; moreover, the instantons can besummed, leading to explicit solutions for both kinds of models. In the case ofsmooth $V$, our results reproduce and clarify an algebraic solution of the $V$model due to Batyrev. In addition, we find an algebraic relation determiningthe solution for $M$ in terms of that for $V$. Finally, we propose amodification of the linear model which computes instanton expansions about anylimiting point in the moduli space. In the smooth case this leads to a (second)algebraic solution of the $M$ model. We use this description to prove someconjectures about mirror symmetry, including the previously conjectured``monomial-divisor mirror map'' of Aspinwall, Greene, and Morrison.
