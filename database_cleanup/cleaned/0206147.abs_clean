We study the evolution of perturbations on a moving probe D3-brane coupled toa 4-form field in an AdS$_5$-Schwarzschild bulk. The unperturbed dynamics areparametrised by a conserved energy $E$ and lead to Friedmann-Robertson-Walker`mirage' cosmology on the brane with scale factor $a(\tau)$. The fluctuationsabout the unperturbed worldsheet are then described by a scalar field$\phi(\tau,\vec{x})$. We derive an equation of motion for $\phi$, and find thatin certain regimes of $a$ the effective mass squared is negative. On anexpanding BPS brane with E=0 superhorizon modes grow as $a^4$ whilst subhorizonmodes are stable. When the brane contracts, all modes grow. We also brieflydiscuss the case when $E>0$, BPS anti-branes as well as non-BPS branes.Finally, the perturbed brane embedding gives rise to scalar perturbations inthe FRW universe. We show that $\phi$ is proportional to the gauge invariantBardeen potentials on the brane.
