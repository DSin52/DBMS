Lipman Bers' universal Teichm\"uller space, classically denoted by $T(1)$,plays a significant role in Teichm\"uller theory, because all the Teichm\"ullerspaces $T(G)$ of Fuchsian groups $G$ can be embedded into it as complexsubmanifolds. Recently, $T(1)$ has also become an object of intensive study inphysics, because it is a promising geometric environment for a non-perturbativeversion of bosonic string theory. We provide a non-technical survey of what iscurrently known about the geometry of $T(1)$ and what is conjectured about itsphysical meaning.
