n-Ising spins on a random surface represented by a matrix model is studied asa model of the 2D gravity coupled to matter field with the central charge c >1. The magnetic field is introduced to discuss the scaling exponent $\Delta$,and the value of this magnetic field exponent is estimated by the seriesexpansion.
