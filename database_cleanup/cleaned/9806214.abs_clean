Any probe which crosses the horizon of a black hole should be absorbed. InM(atrix) theory, for 0-brane probes of Schwarzschild black holes, we argue thatthe relevant absorption mechanism is a tachyon instability which sets in at thehorizon. We give qualitative arguments, and some quantitative large-Ncalculations, in support of this claim. The tachyon instability provides anattractive mechanism for infalling matter to be captured and thermalized by aSchwarzschild black hole.
