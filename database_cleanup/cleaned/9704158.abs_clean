Following recent proposal of Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde, we show thatthe M(atrix) theory compactified on $S_1/Z_2$ provides with anon-perturbative description of second-quantized light-cone heterotic string.This so-called heterotic M(atrix) string theory is defined by two-dimensional(8,0) supersymmetric chiral gauge theory with gauge group SO(2N) in the large Nlimit. We argue that at strong coupling fixed point the chiral gauge theoryflows to a (8,0) superconformal field theory defined via $S_N$ symmetricproduct space orbifold. We show that the leading order correction to the strongcoupling expansion corresponds to a unique irrelevant operator of scalingdimension three and describes joining and splitting cubic interactions oflight-cone heterotic string. We also speculate on M(atrix) description ofbosonic strings via dimensional reduction of d=26 Yang-Mills theory.
