Authors] and a few other minor modifications)This is a write-up of introductory lectures on black holes in string theoryBekenstein-Hawking entropy, the information problem; supergravity actions,conserved quantum numbers, supersymmetry and BPS states, units and duality,dimensional reduction, solution-generating; extremal M-branes and D-branes,smearing, probe actions, nonextremal branes, the Gregory-Laflamme instability;breakdown of supergravity and the Correspondence Principle, limits in parameterspace, singularity resolution; making black holes with branes,intersection-ology, explicit d=5,4 examples; string/brane computations ofextremal black hole entropy in d=5,4, rotation, fractionation; non-extremalityand entropy, the link to BTZ black holes, Hawking radiation and absorptioncross-sections in the string/brane and supergravity pictures.
