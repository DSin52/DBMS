A large class of cosmological solutions (of the Einstein equations) in stringtheory, in the presence of Maxwell fields, is obtained by $O(d,d)$transformations of simple backgrounds with $d$ toroidal isometries. In all theexamples in which we find a (closed) expanding universe, such that the universeadmits a smooth, complete initial value hypersurface, a naked singularity mayform only at the time when the universe collapses. The discrete symmetry group$O(d,d,Z)$ identifies different cosmological solutions with a backgroundcorresponding to a (relatively) simple CFT, and therefore, may be useful inunderstanding the properties of naked singularities in string theory.
