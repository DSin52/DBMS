Recently a non-perturbative formula for the RG flow between UV and IR fixedpoints of the coefficient in the trace of the energy momentum tensor of theEuler density has been obtained for N=1 SUSY gauge theories by relating thetrace and R-current anomalies. This result is compared here with an earlierperturbation theory analysis based on a naturally defined metric on the spaceof couplings for general renormalisable quantum field theories. This approachis specialised to N=1 supersymmetric theories and extended, using consistencyarguments, to obtain the Euler coefficient at fixed points to 4-loops. Theresult agrees completely, to this order, with the exact formula.
