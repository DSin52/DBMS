We consider the group theoretical properties of R--R scalars of stringtheories in the low-energy supergravity limit and relate them to the solvableLie subalgebra $\IG_s\subset U$ of the U--duality algebra that generates thenaturally related with the maximal abelian ideal ${\cal A} \subset \IG_s $ ofthe solvable Lie algebra. The solvable algebras of maximal rank occurring inmaximal supergravities in diverse dimensions are described in some detail. Aparticular example of a solvable Lie algebra is a rank one,$2(h_{2,1}+2)$--dimensional algebra displayed by the classical quaternionicspaces that are obtained via c-map from the special K\"ahlerian moduli spacesof Calabi-Yau threefolds.
