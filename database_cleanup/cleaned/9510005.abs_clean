Title: N=2 String Loops and Spectral Flow

Authors: S. V. Ketov (ITP, University of Hannover, Germany)

Comments: 7 pages, Talk given at the International Workshop on Strings, Gravity

and Related Topics, 29--30 June 1995, ICTP, Trieste, ItalyBased on our previous studies of the BRST cohomology of the critical N=2strings, we construct the loop measure and make explicit the role of thespectral flow at arbitrary genus and Chern class, in a holomorphic field basis.The spectral flow operator attributes to the existence of the hidden `small'N=4 superconformal symmetry which is non-linearly realized. We also discuss thesymmetry properties of N=2 string amplitudes on locally-flat backgrounds.
