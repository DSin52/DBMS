A nonperturbative approach to the vacuum polarization for quantized fermionsin external vector potentials is discussed. It is shown that by a suitablechoice of counterterms the vacuum polarization phase is both gauge andrenormalization independent, within a large class of nonperturbativerenormalizations.
