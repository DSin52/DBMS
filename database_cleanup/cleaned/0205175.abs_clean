The main characteristics of the quantum oscillator coherent states includingthe two-particle Calogero interaction are investigated. We show that theseCalogero coherent states are the eigenstates of the second-order differentialannihilation operator which is deduced via R-deformed Heisenberg algebra orWigner-Heisenberg algebraic technique and correspond exactly to the pureuncharged-bosonic states. They possess the important properties ofnon-orthogonality and completeness. The minimum uncertainty relation for theCalogero interaction coherent states is investigated. New sets of even and oddWigner oscillator coherent states are pointed out.
