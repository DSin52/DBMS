States obtained by projecting boundary states, associated with D-branes, tofixed mass-level and momentum generically define non-trivial cohomologyclasses. For on-shell states the cohomology is the standard one, but when thestates are off-shell the relevant cohomology is defined using a BRST operatorwith ghost zero modes removed. The zero momentum cohomology falls naturallyinto multiplets of $SO(D-1,1)$. At the massless level, a simple set of D-braneconfigurations generates the full set of zero-momentum states of standard ghostnumber, including the discrete states. We give a general construction ofoff-shell cohomology classes, which exhibits a non-trivial interaction betweenleft and right movers that is not seen in on-shell cohomology. This includes,at higher mass levels, states obtained from typical D-brane boundary states aswell as states with more intricate ghost dependence.
