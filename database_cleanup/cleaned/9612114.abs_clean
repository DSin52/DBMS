TASI96These lectures give a self-contained introduction to supersymmetry from amodern perspective. Emphasis is placed on material essential to understandingsupersymmetric nonlinear sigma models, N=2 Yang-Mills theory, holomorphy andthe N=2 Yang-Mills beta function, supersymmetry in 2, 6, 10, and 11 spacetimedimensions.
