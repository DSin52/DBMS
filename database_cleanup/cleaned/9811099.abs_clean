Dynamical spontaneous breaking of some discrete symmetries including specialparities and time reversal and their restoration at finite temperature T areresearched in 3D Gross-Neveu model by means of Schwinger-Dyson equation in thereal-time thermal field theory in the fermion bubble diagram approximation.When the momentum cut-off $\Lambda$ is large enough, the equation of criticalchemical potential $\mu_c$ and critical temperature $T_c$ will be$\Lambda$-independent and identical to the one obtained by auxialiary scalarfield approach. The dynamical fermion mass m, as the order parameter ofsymmetry breaking, has the same $(T_c-T)^{1/2}$ behavior as one in 4D NJL-modelwhen T is less than and near $T_c$ and this shows the second-order phasetransition feature of the symmetry restoration at $T>T_c$. It is also proventhat no scalar bound state could exist in this model.
