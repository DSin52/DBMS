We study three dimensional gauge theories with N=2 supersymmetry. We showthat the Coulomb branches of such theories may be rendered compact by thedynamical generation of Chern-Simons terms and present a new class of mirrorsymmetric theories in which both Coulomb and Higgs branches have a naturaldescription in terms of toric geometry.
