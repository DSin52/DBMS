Representation theory, for the classical binary polyhedral groups is encodedby the affine Dynkin diagrams E6^{(1)}, E7^{(1)} and E8^{(1)} (McKaycorrespondance). The quantum versions of these classical geometries areassociated with representation theories described by the usual Dynkin diagramsE6, E7 and E8. The purpose of these notes is to compare several chosen aspectsof the classical and quantum geometries by using the study of spaces of pathsand spaces of essential paths (Ocneanu theory) on these diagrams. To keep thesize of this contribution small enough, most of our discussion will be limitedto the cases of diagrams E6 and E6^{(1)}, i.e. to the quantum and classicaltetrahedra. We shall in particular interpret the A11 labelling of the verticesof E6 diagram as a quantum analogue of the usual decomposition of spaces ofsections for vector bundles above homogeneous spaces. We also show how torecover Klein invariants of polyhedra by paths algebra techniques and discusstheir quantum generalizations.
