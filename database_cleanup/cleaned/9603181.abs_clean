We derive the couplings of the 3-form supermultiplet to the generalsupergravity-matter-Yang-Mills system. Based on the methods of superspacegeometry, we identify component fields, establish their supergravitytransformations and construct invariant component field actions. Two specificof strong-weak duality and the use of the 3-form supermultiplets to describeeffective degrees of freedom relevant to the mechanism of gaugino condensation.
