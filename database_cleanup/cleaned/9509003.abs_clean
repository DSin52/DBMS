A general expression for the scattering amplitude of nonrelativistic spinlessparticles in the Aharonov-Bohm gauge potential is obtained within the timeindependent formalism. The result is valid also in the backward and forwarddirections as well as for any choice of the boundary conditions on the wavefunction at the flux tube position.
