The level truncation approach to string field theory is used to study thezero-momentum action for vector excitations on a bosonic D-brane which has beenannihilated by tachyon condensation. It is shown that in the true vacuum thetranslation zero modes associated with transverse scalars on the D-brane arelifted by spontaneous generation of mass terms. Similarly, the U(1) gauge fieldon the brane develops a nonzero mass term.
