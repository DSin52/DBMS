The equation of state of a one-dimensional classical nonrelativistic Coulombgas of particles in the adjoint representation of SU(2) is given. The problemis solved both with and without sources in the fundamental representation ateither end of the system. The gas exhibits confining properties at lowdensities and temperatures and deconfinement in the limit of high densities andtemperatures. However, there is no phase transition to a regime where thestring tension vanishes identically; true deconfinement only happens forinfinite densities and temperatures. In the low density, low temperature limit,a new type of collective behavior is observed.
