We discuss $5d$ and $6d$ supersymmetric gauge theories in the target-spacewith compactified directions and with the matter hypermultiplets in fundamentalrepresentations in the framework of integrable systems. In particular, weconsider the prepotentials of these theories and derive explicit formulas fortheir perturbative parts.
