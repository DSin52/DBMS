Title: On particle production by classical backgrounds

Authors: H. Nikolic

Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures included, a misprint corrected

J_{int}The theory of quantum fields in classical backgrounds is re-examined for thecases in which the Lagrangian is quadratic in quantum fields. Various methodsthat describe particle production are discussed. It is found that all methodssuffer from certain ambiguities, related to the choice of coordinates, gauge,or counter-terms. They also seem to be inconsistent with the conservation ofenergy. This suggests that such classical backgrounds may not cause particleproduction.
