We investigate black hole formation by a spherically collapsing thin shell ofmatter in AdS space. This process has been suggested to have a holographicinterpretation as thermalization of the CFT on the boundary of the AdS space.The AdS/CFT duality relates the shell in the bulk to an off-equilibrium stateof the boundary theory which evolves towards a thermal equilibrium when theshell collapses to a black hole. We use 2-point functions to obtain informationabout the spectrum of excitations in the off-equilibrium state, and discuss howit characterizes the approach towards thermal equilibrium. The full holographicinterpretation of the gravitational collapse would require a kinetic theory ofthe CFT at strong coupling. We speculate that the kinetic equations should beinterpreted as a holographic dual of the equation of motion of the collapsingshell.
