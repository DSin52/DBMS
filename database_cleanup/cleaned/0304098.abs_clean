The shifted quantization condition of the M-theory 4-form G_4 is well-known.The most naive generalization to type IIA string theory fails, an orientifoldcounterexample was found by Hori in hep-th/9805141. In this note we useD2-brane anomaly cancellation to find the corresponding shifted quantizationcondition in IIA. Our analysis is consistent with the known O4-plane tensionsif we include a torsion correction to the usual construction of G_4 from C_3, Band G_2. The resulting Bianchi identities enforce that RR fluxes lift toK-theory classes.
