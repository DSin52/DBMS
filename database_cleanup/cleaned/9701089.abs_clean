ProbabilityBell's inequality has been traditionally used to explore the relationshipbetween hidden variables and the Copenhagen interpretation of quantummechanics. In this paper, another use is found. Bell's inequality is used toderive a coupling principle for elementary particles and to give a deeperunderstanding of baryonic structure. We also give a derivation of the Pauli3.65.Bz, 12.40.Ee
