leads to an additional 50-plet of Higgs fields, and an unobserved neutralgauge field gets a very large massWe formulate the flipped SU(5) x U(1)-GUT within the framework ofnon-associative geometry. It suffices to take the matrix Lie algebra su(5) asthe input; the u(1)-part with its representation on the fermions is analgebraic consequence. The occurring Higgs multiplets(24,5,45,50-representations of su(5)) are uniquely determined by the fermionicmass matrix and the spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern to SU(3) x U(1). Wefind the most general gauge invariant Higgs potential that is compatible withthe given Higgs vacuum. Our formalism yields tree-level predictions for themasses of all gauge and Higgs bosons. It turns out that the low-energy sectoris identical with the standard model. In particular, there exists precisely onelight Higgs field, whose upper bound for the mass is 1.45 m_t. All remaining207 Higgs fields are extremely heavy.
