Title: Classical and Quantum W-Gravity

Authors: C. M. Hull

Comments: 54 pages

Classical W-gravities and the corresponding quantum theories are reviewed.W-gravities are higher-spin gauge theories in two dimensions whose gaugealgebras are W-algebras. The geometrical structure of classical W-gravity isinvestigated, leading to surprising connections with self-dual geometry. Theanomalies that arise in quantum W-gravity are discussed, with particularattention to the new types of anomalies that arise for non-linearly realisedsymmetries and to the relation between path-integral anomalies and non-closureof the quantum current algebra. Models in which all anomalies are cancelled byghost contributions lead to new generalisations of string theories.
