The classical equation of motion of a charged point particle, including itsradiation reaction, is described by the Lorentz-Dirac equation. We found a newclass of solutions that describe tunneling (in a completely classicalcontext!). For nonrelativistic electrons and a square barrier, the solution iselementary and explicit. We show the persistance of the solution for smootherpotentials. For a large range of initial velocities, initial conditions mayleave a (discrete) ambiguity on the resulting motion.
