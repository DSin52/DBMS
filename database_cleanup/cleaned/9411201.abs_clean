We reformulate the Thirring model in $D$ $(2 \le D < 4)$ dimensions as agauge theory by introducing $U(1)$ hidden local symmetry (HLS) and study thedynamical mass generation of the fermion through the Schwinger-Dyson (SD)equation. By virtue of such a gauge symmetry we can greatly simplify theanalysis of the SD equation by taking the most appropriate gauge (``nonlocalgauge'') for the HLS.In the case of even-number of (2-component) fermions, we find the dynamicalfermion mass generation as the second order phase transition at certain fermionnumber, which breaks the chiral symmetry but preserves the parity in (2+1)dimensions ($D=3$). In the infinite four-fermion coupling (massless gaugeboson) limit in (2+1) dimensions, the result coincides with that of the(2+1)-dimensional QED, with the critical number of the 4-component fermionbeing $N_{\rm cr} = \frac{128}{3\pi^{2}}$. As to the case of odd-number(2-component) fermion in (2+1) dimensions, the regularization ambiguity on theinduced Chern-Simons term may be resolved by specifying the regularization soas to preserve the HLS.Our method also applies to the (1+1) dimensions, the result being consistentwith the exact solution. The bosonization mechanism in (1+1) dimensionalThirring model is also reproduced in the context of dual-transformed theory forthe HLS.
