It is found that the number, $M_n$, of irreducible multiple zeta values(MZVs) of weight $n$, is generated by $1-x^2-x^3=\prod_n (1-x^n)^{M_n}$. For$9\ge n\ge3$, $M_n$ enumerates positive knots with $n$ crossings. Positiveknots to which field theory assigns knot-numbers that are not MZVs first appearat 10 crossings. We identify all the positive knots, up to 15 crossings, thatare in correspondence with irreducible MZVs, by virtue of the connectionbetween knots and numbers realized by Feynman diagrams with up to 9 loops.
