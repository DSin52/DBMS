In the fruitful interplay between gauge fields and strings and in manyconjectured M-theory dualities, open strings play a prominent role. We reviewthe construction of open-string descendants (un-orientifolds) of closed-stringtheories admitting a generalized orientation reversal involution. We thenspecialize the construction to some classes of non-supersymmetric models inD=10 that have been recently considered in the context of duality withoutsupersymmetry. We also discuss the propagation of open and unoriented stringson the NS pentabrane (N5-brane). This background is a prototype of theconfigurations of branes and orientifold planes that represent a powerfulalternative to the geometric engineering of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories.The resulting description of D-branes in non-trivial backgrounds looks verydifferent from the one naively expected. In particular the very distinctionbetween different Dp-branes becomes ambiguous in the presence of strongcurvature effects.
