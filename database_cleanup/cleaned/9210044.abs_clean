Title: The Quantum Double as Quantum Mechanics

Comments: 36 pages. Revised to include full details for the simplest example

based on sl_2. Accepted to appear in J. Geometry and PhysicsWe introduce $*$-structures on braided groups and braided matrices. Usingthis, we show that the quantum double $D(U_q(su_2))$ can be viewed as thequantum algebra of observables of a quantum particle moving on a hyperboloid inq-Minkowski space (a three-sphere in the Lorentz metric), and with the role ofangular momentum played by $U_q(su_2)$. This provides a new example of aquantum system whose algebra of observables is a Hopf algebra. Furthermore, itsdual Hopf algebra can also be viewed as a quantum algebra of observables, ofanother quantum system. This time the position space is a q-deformation of$SL(2,\R)$ and the momentum group is $U_q(su_2^*)$ where $su_2^*$ is theDrinfeld dual Lie algebra of $su_2$. Similar results hold for the quantumdouble and its dual of a general quantum group.
