We calculate the electric charge at finite temperature $T$ for non-Abelianmonopoles in spontaneously broken gauge theories with a CP violating$\theta$-term. A careful treatment of dyon's gauge degrees of freedom showsthat Witten formula for the dyon charge at $T=0$, $ Q = e(n - \theta/2\pi) $,remains valid at $T \ne 0$.
