Title: Triality of Majorana-Weyl Spacetimes with Different Signatures

Comments: 8 pages, LaTex. Talk given at the Workshop on Super and Quantum

Symmetries, Dubna, July 1999. Appeared in the ProceedingsHigher dimensional Majorana-Weyl spacetimes present space-time dualitieswhich are induced by the Spin(8) triality automorphisms. This corresponds to avery fundamental property of the supersymmetry in higher dimensions, i.e. thatany given theory can be formulated in different signatures all interconnectedby the S_3 permutation group.
