Title: Thermodynamics of a free $SU_q(2)$ fermionic system

Comments: LaTeX file, 13 pages, three figures ,uses psfig.sty, packaged as a

single tar.gz uuencoded fileWe calculate the partition function, average occupation number and internalenergy for a $SU_q(2)$ fermionic system and compare this model at $T=0$ withthe ordinary fermionic, $q=1$, case. At low temperatures and $q\gg 1$ we findthe chemical potential $\mu$ to have the same temperature dependence than theFermi case. For $q\ll 1$, the function $\mu(T)$ has in addition a lineardependence on $T$.
