Title: K3 Surfaces, Igusa Cusp Form and String Theory

Authors: Toshiya Kawai (RIMS, Kyoto University)

Comments: 32 pages, AMS-LaTeX 1.2, some refs added, to appear in the

proceedings of the Taniguchi symposium, ``Topological Field Theory, PrimitiveForms and Related Topics'', Kyoto, December 9-13, 1996It has recently become apparent that the elliptic genera of K3 surfaces (andtheir symmetric products) are intimately related to the Igusa cusp form ofweight ten. In this contribution, I survey this connection with an emphasis onstring theoretic viewpoints.
