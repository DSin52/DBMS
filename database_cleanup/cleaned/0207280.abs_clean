Title: A comment on bouncing and cyclic branes in more than one extra-dimension

Authors: Ph. Brax and D.A. Steer

Comments: 6 pages, 6 figures

We argue that bouncing branes occur naturally when there is more than oneextra-dimension. We consider three-branes embedded in space-times with ahorizon and an isometry group SO(6). As soon as the brane angular momentum islarge enough, a repulsive barrier prevents the branes from reaching thehorizon. We illustrate this phenomenon with the case of D3-branes in anAdS_5-Schwarzschild-S_5 background and asymptotically flat space-time.
