We show how the worldvolume realization of the Hanany-Witten effect for asupersymmetric D5-brane in a D3 background also provides a classicalrealization of the `s-rule' exclusion principle. Despite the supersymmetry, theforce on the D5-brane vanishes only in the D5 `ground state', which is shown tointerpolate between 6-dimensional Minkowski space and an $OSp(4^*|4)$-invariant$adS_2\times S^4$ geometry. The M-theory analogue of these results is brieflydiscussed.
