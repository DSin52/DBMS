Inozemtsev models are classically integrable multi-particle dynamical systemsrelated to Calogero-Moser models. Because of the additional q^6 (rationalmodels) or sin^2(2q) (trigonometric models) potentials, their quantum versionsare not exactly solvable in contrast with Calogero-Moser models. We show thatquantum Inozemtsev models can be deformed to be a widest class of partlysolvable (or quasi-exactly solvable) multi-particle dynamical systems. Theyposses N-fold supersymmetry which is equivalent to quasi-exact solvability. Anew method for identifying and solving quasi-exactly solvable systems, themethod of pre-superpotential, is presented.
