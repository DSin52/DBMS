Title: Time-Ordered Products and Exponentials

Comments: 7 pages with 2 postscript figures composed in Latex. Contribution to

the Second Jagna International Workshop on Mathematical Methods of QuantumPhysics, January 4-8, 1998, at Jagna, Bohol, Philippines, in honour of Prof.Hiroshi Ezawa on the occasion of his 65th birthdayI discuss a formula decomposing the integral of time-ordered products ofoperators into sums of products of integrals of time-ordered commutators. Theresulting factorization enables summation of an infinite series to be carriedout to yield an explicit formula for the time-ordered exponentials. TheCampbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula and the nonabelian eikonal formula obtainedpreviously are both special cases of this result.
