Four and five dimensional extremal black holes with nonzero entropy havesimple presentations in M-theory as gravitational waves bound to configurationsof intersecting M-branes. We discuss realizations of these objects in matrixmodels of M-theory, investigate the properties of zero-brane probes, andpropose a measure of their internal density. A scenario for black hole dynamicsis presented.
