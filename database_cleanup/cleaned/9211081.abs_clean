The duality symmetries of WZW and coset models are discussed. The exactunderlying symmetry responsible for semiclassical duality is identified withthe symmetry under affine Weyl transformations. This identification unifies thetreatement of duality symmetries and shows that in the compact and unitary casethey are exact symmetries of string theory to all orders in $\alpha'$ and inthe string coupling constant. Non-compact WZW models and cosets are alsodiscussed. A toy model is analyzed suggesting that duality will not genericallybe a symmetry.
