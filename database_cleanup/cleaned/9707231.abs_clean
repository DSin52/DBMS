The utility of lattice discretization technique is demonstrated for solvingnonrelativistic quantum scattering problems and specially for the treatment ofultraviolet divergences in these problems with some potentials singular at theorigin in two and three space dimensions. This shows that latticediscretization technique could be a useful tool for the numerical solution ofscattering problems in general. The approach is illustrated in the case of theDirac delta function potential.
