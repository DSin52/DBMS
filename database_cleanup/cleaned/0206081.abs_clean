We study the behavior of the Wilson loop in the (5+1)-dimensionalsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the presence of the solitonic object.Using the dual string description of the Yang-Mills theory that is given by theD1/D5 system, we estimate the Wilson loops both in the temporal and spatialcases. For the case of the temporal loop, we obtain the velocity dependentpotential. For the spatial loop, we find that the area law is emerged due tothe effect of the D1-branes. Further, we consider D1/D5 system in the presenceof the constant B field. It is found that the Wilson loop obeys the area lawfor the effect of the noncommutativity.
