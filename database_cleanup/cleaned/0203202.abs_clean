We investigate half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions of four maximallysupersymmetric D=9 massive supergravity theories obtained by Scherk-Schwarzreduction of D=10 IIA and IIB supergravity. One of the theories does not have asuperpotential and does not allow domain wall solutions preserving anysupersymmetry. The other three theories have superpotentials leading tohalf-supersymmetric domain wall solutions, one of which has zero potential butnon-zero superpotential.The uplifting of these domain wall solutions to ten dimensions leads to threeclasses of half-supersymmetric Type IIB 7-brane solutions. All solutions withineach class are related by SL(2,R) transformations. The three classes togethercontain solutions carrying all possible (quantised) 7-brane charges. One classcontains the well-known D7-brane solution and its dual partners and we providethe explicit solutions for the other two classes. The domain wall solution withzero potential lifts up to a half-supersymmetric conical space-time.
