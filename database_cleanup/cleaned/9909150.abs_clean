We give a complete set of generators for the discrete exceptional U-dualitygroups of toroidal compactified type II theory and M-theory in d>2. For this,we use the DSZ quantization in d=4 as originally proposed by Hull and Townsend,and determine the discrete group inducing integer shifts on the charge lattice.It is generated by fundamental unipotents, which are constructed byexponentiating the Chevalley generators of the corresponding Lie algebra. Wethen extend a method suggested by the above authors and used by Sen for theheterotic string to get the discrete U-duality group in d=3, thereby obtaininga quantized symmetry in d=3 from a d=4 quantization condition. This is studiedfirst in a toy model, corresponding to d=5 simple supergravity, and thenapplied to M-theory. It turns out that, in the toy model, the resultingU-duality group in d=3 is strictly smaller than the one generated by thefundamental unipotents corresponding to all Chevalley generators. However, forM-theory, both groups agree. We illustrate the compactification to d=3 by anembedding of d=4 particle multiplets into the d=3 theory.
