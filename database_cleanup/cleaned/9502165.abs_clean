We give an integral representation of solutions of the ellipticKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations for arbitrary simple Lie algebras. Ifthe level is a positive integer, we obtain formulas for conformal blocks of theWZW model on a torus. The asymptotics of our solutions at critical level giveseigenfunctions of Euler-Calogero-Moser integrable $N$-body systems. As aby-product, we obtain some remarkable integral identities involving classicaltheta functions.
