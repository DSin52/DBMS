Authors: Louis Crane, Louis H. Kauffman, David N. Yetter

Comments: 46 pages

We provide, with proofs, a complete description of the authors' constructionof state-sum invariants announced in [CY], and its generalization to anarbitrary (artinian) semisimple tortile category. We also discuss therelationship of these invariants to generalizations of Broda's surgeryinvariants [Br1,Br2] using techniques developed in the case of the semi-simplesub-quotient of $Rep(U_q(sl_2))$ ($q$ a principal $4r^{th}$ root of unity) byRoberts [Ro1]. We briefly discuss the generalizations to invariants of4-manifolds equipped with 2-dimensional (co)homology classes introduced byYetter [Y6] and Roberts [Ro2], which are the subject of the sequel.
