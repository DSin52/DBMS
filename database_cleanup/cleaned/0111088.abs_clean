Comments: 14 pages, Talk presented at the Conference

in mathematics and physics, Kiev, Sept. 24-27. 2000We present a short review of adelic quantum mechanics pointing out itsnon-Archimedean and noncommutative aspects. In particular, $p$-adic pathintegral and adelic quantum cosmology are considered. Some similarities between$p$-adic analysis and q-analysis are noted. The $p$-adic Moyal product isintroduced.
