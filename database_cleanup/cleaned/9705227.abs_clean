We review the construction of the multiparametric inhomogeneous orthogonalquantum group ISO_qr(N) as a projection from SO_qr(N+2), and recall theconjugation that for N=4 leads to the quantum Poincare group. We study theproperties of the universal enveloping algebra U_qr(iso(N)), and give anR-matrix formulation. A quantum Lie algebra and a bicovariant differentialcalculus on twisted ISO(N) are found.
