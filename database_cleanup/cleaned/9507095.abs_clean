A non-minimal coupling for spin $3/2$ fields is obtained. We use the factthat the Rarita-Schwinger field equations are the square root of the fulllinearized Einstein field equations in order to investigate the form of theinteraction for the spin $3/2$ field with gauge fields. We deduce the form ofthe interaction terms for the electromagnetic and non-Abelian Yang-Mills fieldsby implementing appropiate energy momentum tensors on the linearized Einsteinfield equations. The interaction found for the electromagnetic case happens tocoincide with the dipole term found by Ferrara {\it et al} by a very differentprocedure, namely by demanding $g=2$ at the tree level for the electromagneticinteraction of arbitrary spin particles. The same interaction is found by usingthe resource of linearized Supergravity N=2. For the case of the Yang-Millsfield Supergravity N=4 is linearized, providing the already foreseeninteraction.
