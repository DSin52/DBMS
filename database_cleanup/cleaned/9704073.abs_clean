We develop an adequate description of non-topological solitons with a smallcharge, for which the thin-wall approximation is not valid. There is noclassical lower limit on the charge of a stable Q-ball. We examine theparameters of these small-charge solitons and discuss the limits ofapplicability of the semiclassical approximation.
