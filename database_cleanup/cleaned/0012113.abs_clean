Title: Superspace interpretation of mass-dependent BRST symmetries in general

gauge theoriesAuthors: Bodo Geyer and Dietmar Muelsch

Comments: 6 pages, LATEX

A superspace formulation is proposed for the osp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangianquantization of general massive gauge theories. Thereby, osp(1,2) is consideredas subalgebra of the superalgebra sl(1,2) which is interpreted as conformalalgebra acting on two anticommuting coordinates. The mass-dependent (anti)BRSTsymmetries of the quantum action in the osp(1,2) superfield formalism arerealized as translations associated by mass-dependent special conformaltransformations.
