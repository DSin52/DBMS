We consider the case of several scalar fields, charged under a number of U(1)factors, acquiring vacuum expectation values due to an anomalous U(1). Wedemonstrate how to make redefinitions at the superfield level in order toaccount for tree-level exchange of vector supermultiplets in the effectivesupergravity theory of the light fields in the supersymmetric vacuum phase. Ourapproach builds upon previous results that we obtained in a more elementarycase. We find that the modular weights of light fields are typically shiftedfrom their original values, allowing an interpretation in terms of thepreservation of modular invariance in the effective theory. We address varioussubtleties in defining unitary gauge that are associated with the noncanonicalKahler potential of modular invariant supergravity, the vacuum degeneracy, andthe role of the dilaton field. We discuss the effective superpotential for thelight fields and note how proton decay operators may be obtained when the heavyfields are integrated out of the theory at the tree-level. We also address howour formalism may be extended to describe the generalized Green-Schwarzmechanism for multiple anomalous U(1)'s that occur in four-dimensional Type Iand Type IIB string constructions.
