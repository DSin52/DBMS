Unitarily implementable Bogoliubov transformations for charged, relativisticbos\-ons and fermions are discussed, and explicit formulas for the 2-cocyclesappearing in the group product of their implementers are derived. In thefermion case this provides a simple field theoretic derivation of thewell-known cocycle of the group of unitary Hilbert space operators modeled onthe Hilbert Schmidt class and closely related to the loop groups. In the bosoncase the cocycle is obtained for a similar group of pseudo-unitary (symplectic)operators. I also derive explcite formulas for the phases of one-parametergroups of implementers and, more generally, families of implementers which areunitary propagators with parameter dependent generators.
