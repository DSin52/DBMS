We present string-theory derivation of the semiclassical entropy of extremaldyonic black holes in the approach based on conformal sigma model (NS-NSembedding of the classical solution). We demonstrate (resolving some puzzlesexisted in previous related discussions) that the degeneracy responsible forthe entropy is due to string oscillations in four transverse dimensionsand three non-compact and one compact (responsible for embedding of magneticcharges) dimensions in the D=4 black hole case. Oscillations in other compactinternal dimensions give subleading contributions to statistical entropy in thelimit when all charges are large. The dominant term in the statistical entropyis thus universal (i.e. is the same in type II and heterotic string theory) andagrees with Bekenstein-Hawking expression.
