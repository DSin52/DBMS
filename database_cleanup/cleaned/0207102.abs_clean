We emphasize the necessity of a delicate interplay between the gauge andgravitational sectors of five-dimensional brane worlds in creatingphenomenologically relevant vacua. We discuss locally supersymmetric braneworlds with unflipped and flipped fermionic boundary conditions and with matteron the branes. We point out that a natural separation between the gauge andgravity sectors, very difficult in models with true extra dimensions, may beachieved in 4d models with deconstructed dimensions.
