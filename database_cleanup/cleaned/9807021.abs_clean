An $\alpha$-parameter representation is derived for gauge field theories.Itinvolves, relative to a scalar field theory, only constants and derivativeswith respect to the $\alpha$-parameters. Simple rules are given to obtain the$\alpha$-representation for a Feynman graph with an arbitrary number of loopsin gauge theories in the Feynman gauge.
