Using the conformal invariance of the $SL(2,R)\otimes SO(1,1)^{d-2}/SO(1,1)$coset models we calculate the conformally exact metric and dilaton, to allorders in the $1/k$ expansion. We consider both vector and axial gauging. Weblack hole)$\otimes \IR^{d-2}$ for the vector gauging and ($3d$ blackstring)$\otimes \IR^{d-3}$ for the axial one. In particular for $d=3$ and forthe axial gauging one obtains the exact metric and dilaton of the charged blackstring model introduced by Horne and Horowitz. If the value of $k$ is finite wefind two curvature singularities which degenerate to one in the semi--classical$k\to \infty$ limit. We also calculate the reflection and transmissioncoefficients for the scattering of a tachyon wave and using the Bogoliubovtransformation we find the Hawking temperature.
