A $q$-discretization of \vi\ algebra is studied which reduces to the ordinary\vi\ algebra in the limit of $q \ra 1$. This is derived starting from the Moyalbracket algebra, hence is a kind of quantum deformation different from thequantum groups. Representation of this new algebra by using $q$-parametrizedfree fields is also given.
