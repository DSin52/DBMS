We consider models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking in which theextremization of a tree-level superpotential conflicts with a quantumconstraint. We show that in such models the low-energy effective theory nearthe origin of moduli space is an O'Raifeartaigh model, and the sign of themass-squared for the pseudo-flat direction at the origin is calculable. Weanalyze vector-like models with gauge groups SU(N) and Sp(2N) with and withoutglobal symmetries. In all cases there is a stable minimum at the origin with anunbroken U(1)_R symmetry.
