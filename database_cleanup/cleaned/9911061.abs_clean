Title: Gauge-invariant variables, WZW models and (2+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills

theoryComments: LaTeX file, 11 pages

Recent progress in understanding (2+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills (YM_{2+1})theory via the use of gauge-invariant variables is reviewed. Among otherthings, we discuss the vacuum wavefunction, an analytic calculation of thestring tension and the propagator mass for gluons and its relation to themagnetic mass for YM_{3+1} at nonzero temperature.
