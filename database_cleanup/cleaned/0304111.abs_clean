It is shown that it is possible to define quantum field theory of a masslessscalar free field on the event horizon of a 2D-Rindler spacetime. Quantum freefield theory on the horizon enjoys diffeomorphism invariance and turns out tobe unitarily and algebraically equivalent to the analogous theory of a scalarfield propagating inside Rindler spacetime, nomatter the value of the mass ofthe field in the bulk. More precisely, there exists a unitary transformationthat realizes the bulk-boundary correspondence upon an appropriate choice forFock representation spaces. Secondly, the found correspondence is a subcase ofan analogous algebraic correspondence described by injective *-homomorphisms ofthe abstract algebras of observables generated by abstract quantum free-fieldoperators. These field operators are smeared with suitable test functions inthe bulk and exact 1-forms on the horizon. In this sense the correspondence isindependent from the chosen vacua. It is proven that, under that correspondencethe ``hidden'' SL(2,R) quantum symmetry found in a previous work gets a cleargeometric meaning, it being associated with a group of diffeomorphisms of thehorizon itself. Finally it is found that there is a possible enlargement of thequantum symmetry on the horizon to a quantum Virasoro symmetry associated withvector fields on the event horizon.
