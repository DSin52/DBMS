We study the $\lambda \phi^4$ field theory in a flat Robertson-Walkerspace-time using the functional Sch\"odinger picture. We introduce a simpleGaussian approximation to analyze the time evolution of pure states and weestablish the renormalizability of the approximation. We also show that theenergy-momentum tensor in this approximation is finite once we consider theusual mass and coupling constant renormalizations.
