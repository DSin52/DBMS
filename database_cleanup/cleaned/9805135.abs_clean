Authors: Romuald A. Janik, Jacek Wosiek

Comments: 4 pages, talk presented at the DIS98 workshop, Brussels, April 1998

We present our recent results on the odderon intercept in perturbative QCD,obtained through the solution of the Baxter equation and investigation of thespectrum of the relevant constant of motion.
