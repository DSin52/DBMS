The off-shell dynamics of the O(3) nonlinear sigma-model is probed in termsof spectral densities and two-point functions by means of the form factorapproach. The exact form factors of the Spin field, Noether-current, EM-tensorand the topological charge density are computed up to 6-particles. Thecorresponding $n\leq 6$ particle spectral densities are used to compute thetwo-point functions, and are argued to deviate at most a few per mille from theexact answer in the entire energy range below 10^3 in units of the mass gap.To cover yet higher energies we propose an extrapolation scheme to arbitraryparticle numbers based on a novel scaling hypothesis for the spectraldensities. It yields candidate results for the exact two-point functions at allenergy scales and allows us to exactly determine the values of two, previouslyunknown, non-perturbative constants.
