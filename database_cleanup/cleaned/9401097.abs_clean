Contrary to the conventional view point of quantization that breaks the gaugesymmetry, a gauge invariant formulation of quantum electrodynamics is proposed.Instead of fixing the gauge, some frame is chosen to yield the locallyinvariant fields. We show that all the formulations, such as the Coulomb, theaxial, and the Lorentz gauges, can be constructed and that the explicit LSZmapping connecting Heisenberg operators to those of the asymptotic fields ispossible. We also make some comments on gauge transformations in quantizedfield theory.
