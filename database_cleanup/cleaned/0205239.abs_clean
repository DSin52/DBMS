Comments: 10 pages. Published in " Fluctuating Paths and Fields", Eds. W.

Janke, A. Pelster, H.J. Schmidt, and M. Bachmann (World Scientific,Singapore, 2001)A general path integral analysis of the separable Hamiltonian ofLiouville-type is reviewed. The basic dynamical principle used is the Jacobi'sprinciple of least action for given energy which is reparametrizationinvariant, and thus the gauge freedom naturally appears. The choice of gauge inpath integral corresponds to the separation of variables in operator formalism.The gauge independence and the operator ordering are closely related. The pathintegral in this formulation sums over orbits in space instead of space-time.An exact path integral of the Green's function for the hydrogen atom inparabolic coordinates is ilustrated as an example, which is also interpreted asone-dimensional quantum gravity with a quantized cosmological constant.
