We compute the Boundary Superstring Field Theory partition function on theannulus in the presence of independent linear tachyon profiles on the twoboundaries. The R-R sector is found to contribute non-trivially to thederivative terms of the space-time effective action. In the process weconstruct a boundary state description of D-branes in the presence of a lineartachyon. We quantize the open string in a tachyonic background and address thequestion of open/closed string duality.
