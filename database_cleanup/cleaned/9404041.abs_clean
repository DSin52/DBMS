We study quasifinite highest weight modules over the supersymmetric extensionof the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra on the basis of the analysis by Kac and Radul. Wefind that the quasifiniteness of the modules is again characterized bypolynomials, and obtain the differential equations for highest weights. Thespectral flow, free field realization over the $(B,C)$--system, and theembedding into $\Glinf$ are also presented.
