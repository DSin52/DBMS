Using the spectral representation approach to the Zamolodchikov's c-functionand the Maldacena conjecture for the D1-branes, we compute the entropy of typeIIB strings. An agreement, up to a numerical constant which cannot bedetermined using this approach, with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is found.
