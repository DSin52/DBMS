The minimal length uncertainty principle of Kempf, Mangano and Mann (KMM), asderived from a mutilated quantum commutator between coordinate and momentum, isapplied to describe the modes and wave packets of Hawking particles evaporatedfrom a black hole. The transplanckian problem is successfully confronted inthat the Hawking particle no longer hugs the horizon at arbitrarily closedistances. Rather the mode of Schwarzschild frequency $\omega$ deviates fromthe conventional trajectory when the coordinate $r$ is given by $| r -2M|\simeq \beta_H \omega / 2 \pi$ in units of the non local distance legislatedinto the uncertainty relation. Wave packets straddle the horizon and spread outto fill the whole non local region. The charge carried by the packet (in thesense of the amount of "stuff" carried by the Klein--Gordon field) is notconserved in the non--local region and rapidly decreases to zero as timedecreases. Read in the forward temporal direction, the non--local region thusis the seat of production of the Hawking particle and its partner. The KMMmodel was inspired by string theory for which the mutilated commutator has beenproposed to describe an effective theory of high momentum scattering of zeromass modes. It is here interpreted in terms of dissipation which gives rise tothe Hawking particle into a reservoir of other modes (of as yet unknownorigin). On this basis it is conjectured that the Bekenstein--Hawking entropyfinds its origin in the fluctuations of fields extending over the non localregion.
