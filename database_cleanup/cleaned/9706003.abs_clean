We define a $(k\oplus l|q)$-dimensional supermanifold as a manifold having qodd coordinates and k + l even coordinates with l of them taking only nilpotentvalues. We show that this notion can be used to formulate superconformal fieldtheories with different number of supersymmetries in holomorphic andantiholomorphic sectors.
