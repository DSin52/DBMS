mathematics and physics. Proc. NATO Advanced Research Workshop, Kiev, 2000.Kluwer, 41--48We introduce and completely describe the analogues of the Riemann curvaturetensor for the curved supergrassmannian of the passing through the origin(0|2)-dimensional subsupermanifolds in the (0|4)-dimensional supermanifold withthe preserved volume form. The underlying manifold of this supergrassmannian isthe conventional Penrose's complexified and compactified version of theMinkowski space, i.e., the Grassmannian of 2-dimensional subspaces in the4-dimensional space. The result provides with yet another counterexample toColeman-Mandula's theorem.
