We point out an interesting analogy between the BTZ black hole and QHE(Quantum Hall effect) in the (2+1)-dimensional bulk/boundary theories. It isshown that the Chern-Simons/Liouville(Chern-Simons/chiral boson) is aneffective description for the BTZ black hole (QHE). Also theIR(bulk)-UV(boundary) connection for a black hole information bound is realizedas the UV(low-lying excitations on bulk)-IR(long-range excitations on boundary)connection in the QHE. An inflow of conformal anomaly($c=1$ central charge)onto the timelike boundary of AdS$_3$ by the Noether current corresponds to aninflow of chiral anomaly onto the edge of disk by the Hall current.
