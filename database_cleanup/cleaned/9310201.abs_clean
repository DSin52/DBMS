Let P -> M be a principal G-bundle. Using techniques from the looprepresentation of gauge theory, we construct well-defined substitutes for``Lebesgue measure'' on the space A of connections on P and for ``Haarmeasure'' on the group Ga of gauge transformations. More precisely, we definealgebras of ``cylinder functions'' on the spaces A, Ga, and A/Ga, and definegeneralized measures on these spaces as continuous linear functionals on thecorresponding algebras. Borrowing some ideas from lattice gauge theory, wecharacterize generalized measures on A, Ga, and A/Ga in terms of graphsembedded in M. We use this characterization to construct generalized measureson A and Ga, respectively. The ``uniform'' generalized measure on A isinvariant under the group of automorphisms of P. It projects down to thegeneralized measure on A/Ga considered by Ashtekar and Lewandowski in the caseG = SU(n). The ``generalized Haar measure'' on Ga is right- and left-invariantas well as Aut(P)-invariant. We show that averaging any generalized measure onA against generalized Haar measure gives a gauge-invariant generalized measureon A.
