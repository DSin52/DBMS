It is well known that anomaly cancellations for D_16 Lie algebra are at theroot of the first string revolution. For E_8 Lie algebra, cancellation ofanomalies is the principal fact leading to the existence of heterotic string.They are in fact nothing but the 6th order cohomologies of corresponding Liealgebras. Beyond 6th order, the calculations seem to require special care andit could be that their study will be worthwhile in the light of developments ofthe second string revolution.As we have shown in a recent article, for A_N Lie algebras, there is a methodwhich are based on the calculations of Casimir eigenvalues. This is extended toE_8 Lie algebra in the present article. In the generality of any irreduciblerepresentation of E_8 Lie algebra, we consider 8th and 12th order cohomologieswhile emphasizing the diversities between the two. It is seen that one canrespectively define 2 and 8 basic invariant polinomials in terms of which 8thand 12th order Casimir eigenvalues are always expressed as linearsuperpositions. All these can be easily investigated because each one of theseinvariant polinimials gives us a linear equation to calculate E_8 weightmultiplicities. Our results beyond order 12 are not included here because theyget more complicated though share the same characteristic properties with 12thorder calculations.
