A general formula for the entropy of stationary black holes in Lovelockgravity theories is obtained by integrating the first law of black holemechanics, which is derived by Hamiltonian methods. The entropy is not simplyone quarter of the surface area of the horizon, but also includes a sum ofintrinsic curvature invariants integrated over a cross section of the horizon.
