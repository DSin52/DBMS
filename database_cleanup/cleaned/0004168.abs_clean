We study the low energy regime of the scattering of two fermionic particlescarrying isospin 1/2 and interacting through a non-Abelian Chern-Simons field.We calculate the one-loop scattering amplitude for both the nonrelativistic andalso for the relativistic theory. In the relativistic case we introduce anintermediate cutoff, separating the regions with low and high loop momentaintegration. In this procedure purely relativistic field theory effects as thevacuum polarization and anomalous magnetic moment corrections are automaticallyincorporated.
