The KdV and modified KdV integrable hierarchies are shown to be differentdescriptions of the same 2D gravitational system -- open-closed string theory.Non-perturbative solutions of the multi-critical unitary matrix models map tonon-singular solutions of the `renormalisation group' equation for the stringsusceptibility, $[\tilde{P},Q]=Q$. We also demonstrate that the large Nsolutions of unitary matrix integrals in external fields, studied by Gross andNewman, equal the non-singular pure closed-string solutions of$[\tilde{P},Q]=Q$.
