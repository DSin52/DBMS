Using the superspace formalism, we compute for the two-dimensional N=1supersymmetric non-linear $\sigma$-model, the order $(\alpha^{\prime})^{2}$$(R_{mnpq})^2$ (three-loop) correction to the central charge via the operatorproduct expansion of the supercurrent with itself. The contribution vanishes,in agreement with previous results obtained from the usual $\sigma$-model$\beta$-function approach.
