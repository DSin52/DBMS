A detailed study of the charge spectrum of three dimensional AbelianTopological Massive Gauge Theory (TMGT) is given. When this theory is definedon a manifold with two disconnected boundaries there are induced chiralConformal Field Theories (CFT's) on the boundaries which can be interpreted asthe left and right sectors of closed strings. We show that Narain constraintson toroidal compactification (integer, even, self-dual momentum lattice) have anatural interpretation in purely three dimensional terms. This is an importantresult which is necessary to construct toroidal compactification and heteroticstring from Topological Membrane (TM) approach to string theory. We also derivethe block structure of $c=1$ Rational Conformal Field Theory (RCFT) from thethree dimensional gauge theory.
