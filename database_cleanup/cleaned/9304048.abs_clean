Cosmological solutions of the beta function equations for the backgroundfields of the closed bosonic string are investigated at the one-loop level.Following recent work of Kostelecky and Perry, it is assumed that the spatialsections of the space-time are conformally flat. Working in the sigma-modelframe, the non-trivial tachyon potential is utilized to determine solutionswith sufficient inflation to solve the smoothness and flatness problems. Thegraceful exit and density perturbation constraints can also be successfullyimplemented.
