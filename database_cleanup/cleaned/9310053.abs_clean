For all three--dimensional Lie algebras the construction of generators interms of functions on 4-dimensional real phase space is given with arealization of the Lie product in terms of Poisson brackets. This is theclassical Jordan--Schwinger map which is also given for the deformed algebras${\cal {SL}}_{q}(2,\R)$, ${\cal E}_{q} (2)$ and ${\cal H}_q(1)$. The ${\calU}_{q}(n)$ algebra is discussed in the same context.
