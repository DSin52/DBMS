Title: Geometrical origin of integrability for Liouville and Toda theory

Comments: 19 pages

SystemsWe generalize the Lax pair and B\"acklund transformations for Liouville andToda field theories as well as their supersymmetric generalizations, to thecase of arbitrary Riemann surfaces. We make use of the fact that Toda fieldtheory arises naturally and geometrically in a restriction of so called$W$--geometry to ordinary Riemannian geometry. This derivation sheds light onthe geometrical structure underlying complete integrability of these systems.(Invited talk presented at the 877th meeting of the American MathematicalSociety, USC, November 1992 and at the YITP workshop ``Directions on QuantumGravity", Kyoto, November 1992.)
