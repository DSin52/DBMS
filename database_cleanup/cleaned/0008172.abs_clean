In the first part of this letter, we analyse the supergravity dualdescriptions of six-dimensional field theories realized on the worldvolume of(p,q) five-branes (OD5 theory). We show that in order for the low-energy gaugetheory description to be valid the theta parameter must be rational. Irrationalvalues of theta require a strongly coupled string description of the system atlow-energy. We discuss the phase structure and deduce some properties of thesetheories. In the second part we construct and study the supergravitydescription of NS5-branes with two electric RR field, which provides a dualdescription of six-dimensional theories with several light open D-braneexcitations.
