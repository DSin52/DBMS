Title: Quantum Weyl algebras

Comments: 21 pages

For any Hecke symmetry $R$ there is a natural quantization $A_n(R)$ of theWeyl algebra $A_n$. The aim of this paper is to study some generalring-theoretic aspects of $A_n(R)$ and its relations to formal deformations of$A_n$. We also obtain further information on those quantizations obtained fromsome well-known Hecke symmetries.
