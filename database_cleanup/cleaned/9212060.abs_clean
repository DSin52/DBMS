A complete classification of the WZNW modular invariant partition functionsis known for very few affine algebras and levels, the most significant beingall levels of SU(2), and level 1 of all simple algebras. In this paper we solvethe classification problem for SU(3) modular invariant partition functions. Ourapproach will also be applicable to other affine Lie algebras, and we includesome preliminary work in that direction, including a sketch of a new proof forSU(2).
