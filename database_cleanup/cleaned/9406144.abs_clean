The specific form of the constant term in the asymptotic expansion of theheat-kernel on an axially-symmetric space with a codimension two fixed-pointset of conical singularities is used to determine the associated conformalchange of the effective action in four dimensions. Another derivation of therelevant coefficient is presented.
