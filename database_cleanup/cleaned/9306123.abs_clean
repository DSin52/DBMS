The Mellin-Barnes representation for the free energy of the genus-$g$ stringis constructed. It is shown that the interactions of the open bosonic string donot modify the critical (Hagedorn) temperature. However,for the sectors havinga spinor structure, the critical temperature exists also for all $g$ anddepends on the windings. The appearance of a periodic structure is brieflydiscussed.
