The depth rule is a level truncation of tensor product coefficients expectedto be sufficient for the evaluation of fusion coefficients. We reformulate thedepth rule in a precise way, and show how, in principle, it can be used tocalculate fusion coefficients. However, we argue that the computation of thedepth itself, in terms of which the constraints on tensor product coefficientsis formulated, is problematic. Indeed, the elements of the basis of statesconvenient for calculating tensor product coefficients do not have awell-defined depth! We proceed by showing how one can calculate the depth in an`approximate' way and derive accurate lower bounds for the minimum level atwhich a coupling appears. It turns out that this method yields exact resultsfor $\widehat{su}(3)$ and constitutes an efficient and simple algorithm forcomputing $\widehat{su}(3)$ fusion coefficients.
