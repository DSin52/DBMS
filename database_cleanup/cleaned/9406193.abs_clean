A new theory for the conformal factor in R$^2$-gravity is developed. Theinfrared phase of this theory, which follows from the one-loop renormalizationgroup equations for the whole quantum R$^2$-gravity theory is described. Theone-loop effective potential for the conformal factor is found explicitly and amechanism for inducing Einstein gravity at the minimum of the effectivepotential for the conformal factor is suggested. A comparison with theeffective theory of the conformal factor induced by the conformal anomaly, andalso aiming to describe quantum gravity at large distances, is done.
