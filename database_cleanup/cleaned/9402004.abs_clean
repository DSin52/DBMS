General arguments based on curved space-time thermodynamics show that anyextensive quantity, like the free energy or the entropy of thermal matter,always has a divergent boundary contribution in the presence of event horizons,and this boundary term comes with the Hawking-Bekenstein form. Although thecoefficients depend on the particular geometry we show that intensivequantities, like the free energy density are universal in the vicinity of thehorizon. {} From the point of view of the matter degrees of freedom thisdivergence is of infrared type rather than ultraviolet, and we use this remarkto speculate about the fate of these pathologies in String Theory. Finally weinterpret them as instabilities of the Canonical Ensemble with respect togravitational collapse via the Jeans mechanism.
