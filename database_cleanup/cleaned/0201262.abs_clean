Title: Internal Space-time Symmetries of Massless Particles and Neutrino

Polarization as a Consequence of Gauge InvarianceAuthors: Y. S. Kim

Comments: Latex 9 pages, 2 epsfigs, based on one of the lectures delivered at

the Advanced Study Institute on Symmetries and Spin (Prague, Czech Republic,July 2001)There are gauge-transformation operators applicable to massless spin-1/2particles within the little-group framework of internal space-time symmetriesof massive and massless particles. It is shown that two of the $SL(2,c)$spinors are invariant under gauge transformations while the remaining two arenot. The Dirac equation contains only the gauge-invariant spinors leading topolarized neutrinos. It is shown that the gauge-dependent $SL(2,c)$ spinor isthe origin of the gauge dependence of electromagnetic four-potentials. It isnoted also that, for spin-1/2 particles, the symmetry group for masslessparticles is an infinite-momentum/zero-mass limit of the symmetry group formassive particles.
