This paper describes perturbative framework, on the basis of theclosed-time-path formalism, in terms of quasiparticle picture for studyingquasiuniform relativistic quantum field systems near equilibrium andnonequilibrium quasistationary systems. Two calculational schemes areintroduced, the one is formulated on the basis of the initial-particledistribution function and the one is formulated on the basis of the``physical''-particle distribution function. It is shown that both schemes areequivalent and lead to a generalized kinetic or Boltzmann equation. Concreteprocedure of computing a generic amplitude is presented.
