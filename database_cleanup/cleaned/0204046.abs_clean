An optimized Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger expansion scheme of solving thefunctional Schr\"odinger equation with an external source is proposed tocalculate the effective potential beyond the Gaussian approximation. For ascalar field theory whose potential function has a Fourier representation in asense of tempered distributions, we obtain the effective potential up to thesecond order, and show that the first-order result is just the Gaussianeffective potential. Its application to the $\lambda\phi^4$ field theory yieldsthe same post-Gaussian effective potential as obtained in the functionalintegral formalism.
