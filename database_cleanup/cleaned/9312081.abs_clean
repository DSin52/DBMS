This is a brief review of our recent work attempted at a generalization ofthe Grassmann algebra to the paragrassmann ones. The main aim is constructingan algebraic basis for representing `fractional' symmetries appearing in $2D$integrable models and also introduced earlier as a natural generalization ofsupersymmetries. We have shown that these algebras are naturally related toquantum groups with $q = {\rm root \;of \; unity}$. By now we have a generalconstruction of the paragrassmann calculus with one variable and preliminaryresults on deriving a natural generalization of the Neveu--Schwarz--Ramondalgebra. The main emphasis of this report is on a new general construction ofparagrassmann algebras with any number of variables, N. It is shown that forthe nilpotency indices $(p + 1) = 3, 4, 6$ the algebras are almost as simple asthe Grassmann algebra (for which $(p + 1) = 2$). A general algorithm forderiving algebras with arbitrary p and N is also given. However, it is shownthat this algorithm does not exhaust all possible algebras, and the simplestexample of an `exceptional' algebra is presented for $p = 4, N = 4$.
