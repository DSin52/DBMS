Title: Perturbative Confinement

Comments: Presented at QCD'02, Montpellier, July 2002. 12 pages LaTeX, 8

A Procedure is outlined that may be used as a starting point for aperturbative treatment of theories with permanent confinement. By using acounter term in the Lagrangian that renormalizes the infrared divergence in theCoulomb potential, it is achieved that the perturbation expansion at a finitevalue of the strong coupling constant may yield reasonably accurate propertiesof hadrons, and an expression for the string constant as a function of the QCDLambda parameter.
