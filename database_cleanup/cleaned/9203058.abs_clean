Green and Seiberg showed that, in simple treatments of fermionic stringtheory, it is necessary to introduce contact interactions when vertex operatorscollide. Otherwise, certain superconformal Ward identities would be violated.In this note, we show how these contact terms arise naturally when properaccount is taken of the superconformal geometry involved when puncturescollide. More precisely, we show that there is no contact term at all! Rather,corrections arise to the ``na\"\i ve" formula when the boundary of moduli spaceis described correctly.
