We here give a first indication that there exists a Seiberg-Witten curve forSU(N) Seiberg-Witten theory with matter transforming in the totallyantisymmetric rank three tensor representation. We present a derivation of theleading order hyperelliptic approximation of a curve for this case. Since weare only interested in the asymptotic free theory we are restricted to$N=6,7,8$. The derivation is carried out by reversed engineering starting fromthe known form of the prepotential at tree level. We also predict the form ofthe one instanton correction to the prepotential.
