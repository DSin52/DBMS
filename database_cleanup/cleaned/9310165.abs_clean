We calculate various Wilson loop averages in a pure $SU(N)$-gauge theory on atwo-dimensional sphere, in the large $N$ limit. The results can be expressedthrough the density of rows in the most probable Young tableau. They are validin both phases (small and large areas of the sphere). All averages forself-intersecting loops can be reproduced from the average for a simple (nonself-intersecting) loop by means of loop equations.
