Starting from the boundary CFT definition for the D-branes in vacuum stringfield theory (VSFT) given in hep-th/0105168, we derive the oscillatorexpression for the D24-brane solution in the VSFT on D25-brane. We show thatthe state takes the form of a squeezed state, similar to the one found directlyin terms of the oscillators and reported in hep-th/0102112. Both the solutionsare actually one parameter families of solutions. We also find numericalevidence that at least for moderately large values of the parameter $(b)$ inthe oscillator construction the two families of solutions are same under asuitable redefinition of the parameter. Finally we generalize the method tocomputing the oscillator expression for a D-brane solution with constant gaugefield strength turned on along the world volume.
