The two parameter model is reduced to a one parameter model by using simpletransformations. Because the separation between different phase regions for aone parameter model is just a point, the equivalence between the two modelsleads to the exact equation of the line that separates the broken and un-brokenphases in the $(\lambda ,\sigma)$ plane. Also, we obtain nontrivial estimateson the stability region for this model.
