We study the Schwinger-Dyson equations of a matrix model for an open-closedstring theory. The free energy with source terms for scaling operatorssatisfies the same Virasoro conditions as those of the pure closed string andis obtained from that of the pure closed string by giving appropriatenonvanishing background values to all of the sources.
