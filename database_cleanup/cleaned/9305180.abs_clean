Representations of Quantum Groups U_q (g_n), g_n any semi simple Lie algebraof rank n, are constructed from arbitrary representations of rank n-1 quantumgroups for q a root of unity. Representations which have the maximal dimensionand number of free parameters for irreducible representations arise as specialcases.
