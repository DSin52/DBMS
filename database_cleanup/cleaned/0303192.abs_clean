We elaborate on the duality-symmetric nonlinear electrodynamics in a newformulation with auxiliary tensor fields. The Maxwell field strength appearsonly in bilinear terms of the corresponding generic Lagrangian, while theself-interaction is presented by a function E depending on the auxiliaryfields. Two types of dualities inherent in the nonlinear electrodynamics modelsadmit a simple off-shell characterization in terms of this function. In thestandard formulation, the continuous U(1) duality symmetry is nonlinearlyrealized on the Maxwell field strength. In the new setting, the same symmetryacts as linear U(1) transformations of the auxiliary field variables. Thenonlinear U(1) duality condition proves to be equivalent to the linear U(1)invariance of the self-interaction E. The discrete self-duality (orself-duality by Legendre transformation) amounts to a weaker reflectionsymmetry of E. For a class of duality- symmetric Lagrangians we introduce analternative representation with the auxiliary scalar field and find newexplicit examples of such systems.
