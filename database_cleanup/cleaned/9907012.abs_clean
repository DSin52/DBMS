Title: Entropy Bounds and String Cosmology

Brussels, March 1999After discussing some old (and not-so-old) entropy bounds both for isolatedsystems and in cosmology, I will argue in favour of a "Hubble entropy bound"holding in the latter context. I will then apply this bound to recentdevelopments in string cosmology, show that it is naturally saturatedthroughout pre-big bang inflation, and claim that its fulfilment at later timeshas interesting implications for the exit problem of string cosmology.
