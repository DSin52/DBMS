A new gauge invariant formulation of the relativistic scalar fieldinteracting with Chern-Simons gauge fields is considered. This formulation isconsistent with the gauge fixed formulation. Furthermore we find that canonical(Noether) Poincar\'e generators are not gauge invariant even on the constraintssurface and do not satisfy the (classical) Poincar\'e algebra. It is theimproved generators, constructed from the symmetric energy-momentum tensor,which are (manifestly) gauge invariant and obey the classical Poincar\'ealgebra.
