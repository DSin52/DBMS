The antifields of the Batalin-Vilkovisky Lagrangian quantization are standardantighosts of certain collective fields. These collective fields ensure thatSchwinger-Dyson equations are satisfied as a consequence of the gauge symmetryalgebra. The associated antibracket and its canonical structure appearnaturally if one integrates out the corresponding ghost fields. An analogousMaster Equation for the action involving these ghosts follows from therequirement that the path integral gives rise to the correct Schwinger-Dysonequations.
