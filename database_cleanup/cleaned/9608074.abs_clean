We build generalizations of the Grassmann algebras from a few simpleassumptions which are that they are graded, maximally symmetric and contain anordinary Grassmann algebra as a subalgebra. These algebras are graded byZ_{n}^{3} and display surprising properties that indicate their possibleapplication to the modelization of quark fields. We build the generalizedsupersymmetry generators based on these algebras and their derivationoperators. These generators are cubic roots of the usual supersymmetrygenerators.
