Title: TASI Lectures on Perturbative String Theory and Ramond-Ramond Flux

Comments: 39 pages, latex

These lectures provide an introduction to perturbative string theory and itsconstruction on spaces with background Ramond flux. Traditional covariantquantization of the string and its connection with vertex operators andconformal invariance of the worldsheet theory are reviewed. A supersymmetriccovariant quantization of the superstring in six and ten spacetime dimensionsis discussed. Correlation functions are computed with these variables.Applications to strings in anti-de Sitter backgrounds with Ramond flux areanalyzed. Based on lectures presented at the Theoretical Advanced StudyInstitute TASI 2001, June 3-29, 2001.
