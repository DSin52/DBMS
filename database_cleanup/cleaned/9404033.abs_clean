When the supersymmetric theory contains the ``anomalous" $U(1)$ gaugesymmetry with Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism in 4 dimensions, itsFayet-Iliopoulos $D$-term generates non-universal scalar masses and thepositive cosmological constant after the supersymmetry breaking. Both give thenew contributions to the known results from $F$-term. Our mechanism isnaturally realized in many string models and in some cases, leads to remarkablecancellations between $F$- and $D$-term contributions, providing the universalscalar mass and vanishing cosmological constant. We illustrate how such apossibility can arise by taking a simple orbifold example.
