Feynman diagrams are the best tool we have to study perturbative quantumfield theory. For this very reason the development of any new technique whichallows us to compute Feynman integrals is welcome. By the middle of the 80's,Halliday and Ricotta suggested the possibility of using negative dimensionalintegrals to tackle the problem. The aim of this work is to revisit thetechnique as such and check up on its possibilities. For this purpose, we takea box diagram integral contributing to the photon-photon scattering amplitudein quantum electrodynamics using the negative dimensional integration method.integral with well-known results, and secondly because it bears in itsintegrand the complexities associated with four massive propagators of theintermediate states.
