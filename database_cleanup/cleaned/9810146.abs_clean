We study in detail the extension of the generalized conformal symmetryproposed previously for D-particles to the case of supersymmetric Yang-Millsmatrix models of Dp-branes for arbitrary p. It is demonstrated that such asymmetry indeed exists both in the Yang-Mills theory and in the correspondingsupergravity backgrounds produced by Dp-branes. On the Yang-Mills side, wederive the field-dependent special conformal transformations for the collectivecoordinates of Dp-branes in the one-loop approximation, and show that theycoincide with the transformations on the supergravity side. Thesetransformations are powerful in restricting the forms of the effective actionsof probe D-branes in the fixed backgrounds of source D-branes. Furthermore, ourformalism enables us to extend the concept of (generalized) conformal symmetryto arbitrary configurations of D-branes, which can still be used to restrictthe dynamics of D-branes. For such general configurations, however, it cannotbe endowed a simple classical space-time interpretation at least in the staticgauge adopted in the present formulation of D-branes.
