It has been proposed that translationally-invariant black branes areclassically stable if and only if they are locally thermodynamically stable.Reall has outlined a general argument to demonstrate this, and studied indetail the case of charged black p-branes in type II supergravity. We considerthe application of his argument in the simplest non-trivial case, an unchargedasymptotically flat brane enclosed in a finite cylindrical cavity. In thissimple context, it is possible to give a more complete argument than in thecases considered earlier, and it is therefore a particularly attractive exampleof the general approach.
