Title: O(N) Vector Models in the Limit $g \rightarrow g_c $ and Finite

TemperatureAuthors: Moshe Moshe

Comments: (Summary of a talk at Banff Workshope) (5 pages)

In the limit where $N\to\infty$ and the coupling constant $g \to g_{c}$ in acorrelated manner, O(N) symmetric vector models represent filamentary surfaces.The purpose of these studies is to gain intuition for the long lasting searchfor a possible description of quantum field theory in terms of extendedobjects. It is shown here that a certain limiting procedure has to be followedin order to avoid several difficulties in establishing the theory at a criticalnegative coupling constant. It is also argued that at finite temperature acertain metastable-false vacuum disappears as the temperature is increased.
