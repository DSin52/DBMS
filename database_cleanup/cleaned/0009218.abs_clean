ConferenceThe motion of spinning relativistic particles in external electromagnetic andgravitational fields is considered. Covariant equations for this motion aredemonstrated to possess pathological solutions, when treated nonperturbativelyin spin. A self-consistent approach to the problem is formulated, based on thenoncovariant description of spin and on the usual, ``naive'' definition of thecoordinate of a relativistic particle. A simple description of thegravitational interaction of first order in spin, is pointed out for arelativistic particle. The approach developed allows one to consider effects ofhigher order in spin. Explicit expression for the second-order Hamiltonian ispresented. We discuss the gravimagnetic moment, which is a special spin effectin general relativity.
