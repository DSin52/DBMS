Title: Information Retrieval from a Charge `Trap'

We study the model of massless $1+1$ electrodynamics with nonconstantcoupling, introduced by Peet, Susskind and Thorlacius as the `charge hole'. Butwe take the boundary of the strong coupling region to be first timelike, thenspacelike for a distance $X$, and then timelike again (to mimic the structureof a black hole). For an incident charge pulse entering this `charge trap' thecharge and information get separated. The charge comes out near the endpoint ofthe singularity. The `information' travels a well localised path through thestrong coupling region and comes out later.
