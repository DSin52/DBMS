In cases of both abelian and nonabelian gauge groups, we study the Higgsmechanism in the topologically massive gauge theories in an arbitraryspace-time dimension. We show that when the conventional Higgs potentialcoexists with a topological term, gauge fields become massive by 'eating'simultaneously both the Nambu-Goldstone boson and a higher-rank tensor field,and instead a new massless scalar field is 'vomitted' in the physical spectrum.Because of the appearance of this new massless field, the number of thephysical degrees of freedom remains unchanged before and after the spontaneoussymmetry breakdown. Moreover, the fact that the new field is a physical andpositive norm state is rigorously proved by performing the manifestly covariantquantization of the model in three and four dimensions. In the mechanism athand, the presence of a topological term makes it possible to shift mass ofgauge fields in a nontrivial manner compared to the conventional value.
