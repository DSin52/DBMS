445-462A strict proof of equivalence between Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) andKlein-Gordon (KG) theories is presented for physical S-matrix elements in thecase of charged scalar particles interacting in minimal way with an external orquantized electromagnetic field. First, Hamiltonian canonical approach to DKPtheory is developed in both component and matrix form. The theory is thenquantized through the construction of the generating functional for Greenfunctions (GF) and the physical matrix elements of S-matrix are proved to berelativistic invariants. The equivalence between both theories is then provedusing the connection between GF and the elements of S-matrix, including thecase of only many photons states, and for more general conditions - so calledreduction formulas of Lehmann, Symanzik, Zimmermann.
