We present an analysis of currents and charges for a system of two mixedfields, both for spinless bosons and for Dirac fermions. This allows us toobtain in a straightforward way the exact field theoretical oscillationformulas exhibiting corrections with respect to the usual ones derived inquantum mechanics.
