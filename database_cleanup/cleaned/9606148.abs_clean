We discuss some aspects of F-theory in four dimensions on ellipticallyfibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds which are Calabi-Yau threefold fibrations. Aparticularly simple class of such manifolds emerges for fourfolds in which thegeneric Calabi-Yau threefold fiber is itself an elliptic fibration and is K3fibered. Duality between F-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau fourfolds andheterotic strings on Calabi-Yau threefolds puts constraints on the cohomologyof the fourfold. By computing the Hodge diamond of Calabi-Yau fourfolds weprovide first numerical evidence for F-theory dualities in four dimensions.
