We make a proposal for a bosonic field theory in twelve dimensions thatadmits the bosonic sector of eleven-dimensional supergravity as a consistenttruncation. It can also be consistently truncated to a ten-dimensionalLagrangian that contains all the BPS p-brane solitons of the type IIB theory.The mechanism allowing the consistent truncation in the latter case is unusual,in that additional fields with an off-diagonal kinetic term are non-vanishingand yet do not contribute to the dynamics of the ten-dimensional theory. Theydo, however, influence the oxidation of solutions back to twelve dimensions. Wepresent a discussion of the oxidations of all the basic BPS solitons ofM-theory and the type IIB string to D=12. In particular, the NS-NS and R-Rstrings of the type IIB theory arise as the wrappings of membranes in D=12around one or other circle of the compactifying 2-torus.
