We address the general question of how to reconstruct the field content of aquantum field theory from a given scattering theory in the context of the formfactor program. For the $SU(3)_2$-homogeneous Sine-Gordon model we constructsystematically all $n$-particle form factors for a huge class of operators interms of general determinant formulae. We investigate how different operatorsare interrelated by the momentum space cluster property. Finally we computeseveral two-point correlation functions and carry out the ultraviolet limit inorder to identify each operator with its corresponding partner in theunderlying conformal field theory.
