We present a non-abelian generalization of Witten monopole equations and weanalyze the associated moduli problem, which can be regarded as ageneralization of Donaldson theory. The moduli space of solutions for SU(2)monopoles on K\"ahler manifolds is discussed. We also construct, using theMathai-Quillen formalism, the topological quantum field theory corresponding tothe new moduli problem. This theory involves the coupling of topologicalYang-Mills theory to topological matter in four dimensions
