Generalizing the recent work on three-family Type I compactifications, weclassify perturbative Type I vacua obtained via compactifying on the T^6/Z_2 XZ_2 X Z_3 orbifold with all possible Wilson lines. In particular, weconcentrate on models with gauge groups containing the Standard Model gaugegroup SU(3)_c X SU(2)_w X U(1)_Y as a subgroup. All of the vacua we obtaincontain D5-branes and are non-perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint. Themodels we discuss have three-chiral families. We study some of theirphenomenological properties, and point out non-trivial problems arising inthese models in the phenomenological context.
