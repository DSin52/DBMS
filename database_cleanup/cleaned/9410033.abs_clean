We revisit the solvable lattice models described by Andrews Baxter andForrester and their generalizations. The expressions for the local stateprobabilities were shown to be related to characters of the minimal models. Werecompute these local state probabilities by a different method. This yieldsgeneralized Rogers Ramanujan identities, some of which recently conjectured byKedem et al. Our method provides a proof for some cases, as well as generatingnew such identities.
