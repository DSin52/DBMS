The program of induced QCD requires that there exist self-interactions amongthe heavy matter fields (an adjoint scalar and a few fermions in thefundamental representation) which tend to spoil the asymptotic freedom of SU(N)gauge theory. We consider general interactions between such matter fields andshow that, on the contrary, to two loops, they all tend to enhance asymptoticfreedom in the perturbative regime. This result casts doubt on whether inducedQCD is equivalent to real QCD.
