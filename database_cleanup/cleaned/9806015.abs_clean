We study the Donaldson-Witten function in four-dimensional topological gaugetheory which is constructed from N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory with$N_f < 4$ massless fundamental hypermultiplets. When $N_f = 2,3$, thestrong-coupling singularities with multiple massless monopoles appear in themoduli space (the u-plane) of the Coulomb branch. We show that the invariantsmade out of such singularities exhibit a property which is similar to the oneexpected for four-manifolds of generalized simple type.
