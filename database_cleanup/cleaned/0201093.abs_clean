One can geometrically engineer supersymmetric field theories theories byplacing D-branes at or near singularities. The opposite process is described,where one can reconstruct the singularities from quiver theories. Thedescription is in terms of a noncommutative quiver algebra which is constructedfrom the quiver diagram and the superpotential. The center of thisnoncommutative algebra is a commutative algebra, which is the ring ofholomorphic functions on a variety V. If certain algebraic conditions are met,then the reverse geometric engineering produces V as the geometry that D-branesprobe. It is also argued that the identification of V is invariant underSeiberg dualities.
