We investigate the possibility of generalizing differential renormalizationof D.Z.Freedman, K.Johnson and J.I.Latorre in an invariant fashion to theorieswith infrared divergencies via an infrared $\tilde{R}$ operation.Two-dimensional $\sigma$ models and the four-dimensional $\phi^4$ theorydiagrams with exceptional momenta are used as examples, while dimensionalrenormalization serves as a test scheme for comparison. We write the basicdifferential identities of the method simultaneously in co-ordinate andmomentum space, introducing two scales which remove ultraviolet and infraredsingularities. The consistent set of Fourier-transformation formulae isderived. However, the values for tadpole-type Feynman integrals in higherorders of perturbation theory prove to be ambiguous, depending on the order ofevaluation of the subgraphs. In two dimensions, even earlier than thisambiguity manifests itself, renormalization-group calculations based oninfrared extension of differential renormalization lead to incorrect results.We conclude that the extended differential renormalization procedure does notperform the infrared $\tilde{R}$ operation in a self-consistent way, as theoriginal recipe does the ultraviolet $R$ operation.
