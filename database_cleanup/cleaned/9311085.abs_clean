We investigate the connection between curved spacetime and the emergence ofstring-instabilities, following the approach developed by Loust\'{o} andS\'{a}nchez for de Sitter and black hole spacetimes. We analyse the linearisedequations determining the comoving physical (transverse) perturbations oncircular strings embedded in Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and deSitter backgrounds. In all 3 cases we find that the "radial" perturbations growinfinitely for $r\rightarrow 0$ (ring-collapse), while the "angular"perturbations are bounded in this limit. For $r\rightarrow\infty$ we find thatthe perturbations in both physical directions (perpendicular to the stringworld-sheet in 4 dimensions) blow up in the case of de Sitter space. Thisconfirms results recently obtained by Loust\'{o} and S\'{a}nchez who consideredperturbations around the string center of mass.
