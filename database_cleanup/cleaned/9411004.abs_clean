We give an explicit description of the vector bundle of WZW conformal blockson elliptic curves with marked points as subbundle of a vector bundle of Weylgroup invariant vector valued theta functions on a Cartan subalgebra. We give apartly conjectural characterization of this subbundle in terms of certainvanishing conditions on affine hyperplanes. In some cases, explicit calculationare possible and confirm the conjecture. The Friedan--Shenker flat connectionis calculated, and it is shown that horizontal sections are solutions ofBernard's generalization of the Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation.
