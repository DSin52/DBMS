In a previous paper we have shown how, for bosonic fields, the generatingfunctional in both relativistic quantum field theory and thermal field theorycan be evaluated by use of a standard quantum mechanical path integral. In thispaper we extend this method to include fermionic fields. A particular problemis posed by Green's functions with external fermionic lines, where thedifferent boundary conditions of bosons and fermions in imaginary time have tobe accommodated within one path integral expression. The general procedure isworked out in the example of scalar and spinor self-energies in a simple modelwith a Yukawa coupling of a scalar to a Majorana spinor.
