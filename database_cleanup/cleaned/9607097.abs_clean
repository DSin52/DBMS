We propose a method of constructing a gauge invariant canonical formulationfor non-gauge classical theory which depends on a set of parameters.Requirement of closure for algebra of operators generating quantum gaugetransformations leads to restrictions on parameters of the theory. Thisapproach is then applied for illustration to bosonic string theory coupled tobackground tachyonic field. It is shown that within the proposed canonicalformulation the known mass-shell condition for tachyon is produced.
