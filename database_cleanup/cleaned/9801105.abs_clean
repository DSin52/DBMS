A simple, often invoked, regularization scheme of quantum mechanical pathFourier series, performs calculations with only the first $M$ modes, and at theend takes the limit $M \to \infty$. This simple scheme does not manifestlynoncovariant terms of order $\hbar^2$ must be added to the action in order tomaintain general coordinate invariance. Regularization by time slicing requiresa different set of terms of order $\hbar^2$ which can be derived from Weylordering of the Hamiltonian. With these counterterms both schemes give the sameanswers to all orders of loops. As a check we perform the three-loopcalculation of the trace anomaly in four dimensions in both schemes. We alsopresent a diagrammatic proof of Matthews' theorem that phase space andconfiguration space path integrals are equal.
