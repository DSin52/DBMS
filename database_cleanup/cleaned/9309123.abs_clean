Not only does Chern-Simons (CS) coupling characterize statistics, but alsospin and scaling dimension of matter fields. We demonstrate spin transmutationin relativistic CS matter theory, and moreover show equivalence of severalmodels. We study CS vector model in some details, which provide consistentcheck to the assertion of the equivalence.
