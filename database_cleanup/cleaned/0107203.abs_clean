It was suggested by Sugimoto that there is a new supersymmetry breakingmechanism by an orientifold plane which is oppositely charged as the usual one.Here we prove the trace formula for this system to show that the supersymmetryis broken not explicitly but spontaneously. We also discuss the possibility ofinterpreting the orientifold plane as an intrinsic object of the superstringtheory.
