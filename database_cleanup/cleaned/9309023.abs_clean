The inflationary scenarios suggested by the duality properties of stringcosmology in the Brans-Dicke (or String) frame are shown to correspond toaccelerated contraction (deflation) whenWeyl-transformed to the Einstein frame. We point out that the basic virtuesof inflation (solving the flatness and horizon problems, amplifying vacuumfluctuations, etc.) have physically equivalent counterparts in the deflationary(Einstein-frame) picture. This could be the answer to some objections recentlyraised to superstring cosmology.
