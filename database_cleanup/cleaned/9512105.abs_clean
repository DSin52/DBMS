We investigate higher grading integrable generalizations of the affine Todasystems. The extra fields, associated to non zero grade generators, obey fieldequations of the Dirac type and are regarded as matter fields. The modelspossess soliton configurations, which can be interpreted as particles of thetheory, on the same footing as those associated to fundamental fields. Aspecial subclass of these models is remarkable. They possess a $U(1)$ Noethercurrent which, after a special gauge fixing of the conformal symmetry, isproportional to a topological current. This leads to the confinement of thematter field inside the solitons, which can be regarded as a one dimensionalbag model for QCD. These models are also relevent to the study of electronself--localization in (quasi)-one-dimensional electron--phonon systems.
