The orbifold CFT dual to string theory on $ADS_3 \times S^3$ allows aconstruction of gravitational actions based on collective field techniques. Wedescribe a fundamental role played by a Lie algebra constructed from chiralprimaries and their CFT conjugates. The leading terms in the algebra at large$N$ are derived from the computation of chiral primary correlation functions.The algebra is argued to determine the dynamics of the theory, itsrepresentations provide free and interacting hamiltonians for chiral primaries.This dynamics is seen to be given by an effective one plus one dimensionalfield theory. The structure of the algebra and its representations showsqualitatively new features associated with thresholds at $L_0= N$, $ L_0 = N/2$and $L_0=N/4$, which are related to the stringy exclusion principle and toblack holes. We observe relations between fusion rules of $SU_q(2|1,1)$ for$q = e^{i \pi / {N+1}} $, and the correlation functions, which provide furtherevidence for a non-commutative spacetime.
