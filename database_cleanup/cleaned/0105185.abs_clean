We derive the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation defined over a generalassociative algebra and construct its N-soliton solution. For the example ofthe Moyal algebra, we find multi-soliton solutions for arbitrary space-spacenoncommutativity. The noncommutativity of coordinates is shown to obstruct thegeneral construction of a tau function for these solitons. We investigate thetwo-soliton solution in detail and show that asymptotic observers of solitonscattering are unable to detect a finite spatial noncommutativity. An explicitexample shows that a pair of solitons in a noncommutative background can beinterpreted as several pairs of image solitons. Finally, a dimensionalreduction gives the general N-soliton solution for the previously discussednoncommutative KdV equation.
