The possible boundary conditions consistent with the integrability of theclassical sine-Gordon equation are studied. A boundary value problem on thehalf-line $x\leq 0$ with local boundary condition at the origin is considered.The most general form of this boundary condition is found such that the problembe integrable. For the resulting system an infinite number of involutiveintegrals of motion exist. These integrals are calculated and one is identifiedas the Hamiltonian. The results found agree with some recent work of Ghoshaland Zamolodchikov.
