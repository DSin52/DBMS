Modular invariant conformal field theories with just one primary field andcentral charge $c=24$ are considered. It has been shown previously that if thechiral algebra of such a theory contains spin-1 currents, it is either theLeech lattice CFT, or it contains a Kac-Moody sub-algebra with total centralcharge 24. In this paper all meromorphic modular invariant combinations of theallowed Kac-Moody combinations are obtained. The result suggests the existenceof 71 meromorphic $c=24$ theories, including the 41 that were already known.
