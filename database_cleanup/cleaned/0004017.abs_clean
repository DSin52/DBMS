The quantum mechanics of $N$ slowly-moving BPS black holes in five dimensionsis considered. A divergent continuum of states describing arbitrarily closelybound black holes with arbitrarily small excitation energies is found. Asuperconformal structure appears at low energies and can be used to define anindex counting the weighted number of supersymmetric bound states. It is shownthat the index is determined from the dimensions of certain cohomology classeson the symmetric product of $N$ copies of $R^4$. An explicit computation forthe case of N=2 with no angular momentum yields a finite nonzero result.
