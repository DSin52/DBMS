The spectrum of D2-branes wrapped on an ALE space of general ADE type isdetermined, by representing them as boundary states of N=2 superconformalminimal models. The stable quantum states have RR charges which preciselyrepresent the gauge fields of the corresponding Lie algebra. This provides asimple and direct physical link between the ADE classification of N=2superconformal field theories, and the corresponding root systems. An affineextension of this structure is also considered, whose boundary states representthe D2-branes plus additional D0-branes.
