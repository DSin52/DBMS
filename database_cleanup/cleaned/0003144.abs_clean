We find static solitons stabilized by quantum corrections in a(1+1)-dimensional model with a scalar field chirally coupled to fermions. Thismodel does not support classical solitons. We compute the renormalized energyfunctional including one-loop quantum corrections. We carry out a variationalsearch for a configuration that minimizes the energy functional. We find anontrivial configuration with fermion number whose energy is lower than thesame number of free fermions quantized about the translationally invariantvacuum. In order to compute the quantum corrections for a given backgroundfield we use a phase-shift parameterization of the Casimir energy. We identifyorders of the Born series for the phase shift with perturbative Feynmandiagrams in order to renormalize the Casimir energy using perturbativelydetermined counterterms. Generalizing dimensional regularization, wedemonstrate that this procedure yields a finite and unambiguous energyfunctional.
