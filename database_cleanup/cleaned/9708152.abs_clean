Using index-free notation, we present the diagonal values of the first fiveheat kernel coefficients associated with a general Laplace-type operator on acompact Riemannian space without boundary. The fifth coefficient appears herefor the first time. For a flat space with a gauge connection, the sixthcoefficient is given too. Also provided are the leading terms for anycoefficient, both in ascending and descending powers of the Yang-Mills andRiemann curvatures, to the same order as required for the fourth coefficient.These results are obtained by directly solving the relevant recursionrelations, working in Fock-Schwinger gauge and Riemann normal coordinates. Ourprocedure is thus noncovariant, but we show that for any coefficient the`gauged' respectively `curved' version is found from the corresponding`non-gauged' respectively `flat' coefficient by making some simple covariantsubstitutions. These substitutions being understood, the coefficients retaintheir `flat' form and size. In this sense the fifth and sixth coefficient haveonly 26 and 75 terms respectively, allowing us to write them down. Usingindex-free notation also clarifies the general structure of the heat kernelcoefficients. In particular, in flat space we find that from the fifthcoefficient onward, certain scalars are absent. This may be relevant for theanomalies of quantum field theories in ten or more dimensions.
