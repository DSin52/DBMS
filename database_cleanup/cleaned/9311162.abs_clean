509-523In the Higgs phase we may be left with a residual finite symmetry group H ofthe condensate. The topological interactions between the magnetic- and electricexcitations in these so-called discrete H gauge theories are completelydescribed by the Hopf algebra or quantumgroup D(H). In 2+1 dimensional spacetime we may add a Chern-Simons term to such a model. This deforms theunderlying Hopf algebra D(H) into a quasi-Hopf algebra by means of a 3-cocycleH. Consequently, the finite number of physically inequivalent discrete H gaugetheories obtained in this way are labelled by the elements of the cohomologygroup H^3(H,U(1)). We briefly review the above results in these notes. Specialattention is given to the Coulomb screening mechanism operational in the Higgsphase. This mechanism screens the Coulomb interactions, but not theAharonov-Bohm interactions.
