The full low energy effective action of N=4 SYM is believed to be self-dual.Starting with the first two leading terms in a momentum expansion of thiseffective action, we perform a duality transformation and find the conditionsfor self-duality. These determine some of the higher order terms. We comparethe effective action of N=4 SYM with the probe-source description of type II_BD3-branes in the AdS_5 \times S_5 background. We find agreement up to sixderivative terms if we identify the separation of the 3-branes with aredefinition of the gauge scalar that involves the gauge field strength.
