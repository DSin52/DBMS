In this paper, we systematically study the question of screening length inAbelian Chern-Simons theories. In the Abelian Higgs theory, where there are twomassive poles in the gauge propagator at the tree level, we show that thecoefficient of one of them becomes negligible at high temperature and that thescreening length is dominantly determined by the parity violating part of theself-energy. In this theory, static magnetic fields are screened. In thefermion theory, on the other hand, the parity conserving part of theself-energy determines the screening length and static magnetic fields are notscreened. Several other interesting features are also discussed.
