The helix model describes the minimal coupling of an abelian gauge field withthree bosonic matter fields in 0+1 dimensions; it is a model without a globalGribov obstruction. We perform the stochastic quantization in configurationspace and prove nonperturbatively equivalence with the path integral formalism.Major points of our approach are the geometrical understanding of separationsinto gauge independent and gauge dependent degrees of freedom as well as ageneralization of the stochastic gauge fixing procedure which allows to extractthe equilibrium Fokker-Planck probability distribution of the model.
