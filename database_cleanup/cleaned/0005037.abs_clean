Theconformal symmetry is fixed by setting a connection to zero, then one definesan off-critical model, the affine Toda model coupled to the matter (ATM). Thequantum version of this reduction process is discussed by means of theperturbative Lagrangian viewpoint, showing that the ATM theory is aspontaneously broken and reduced version of the CATM model. We show, usingbosonization techniques that the off-critical theory decouples into asine-Gordon model and a free scalar. Using the "dressing" transformation methodwe construct the explicit forms of the one and two-soliton classical solutions,and show that a physical bound soliton-antisoliton pair (breather) does notexist. Moreover, we verify that these solutions share some features of thesine- Gordon (massive Thirring) solitons, and satisfy the classical equivalenceof topological and Noether currents in the ATM model. Imposing the Noether andtopological currents equivalence as a constraint, one can show that the ATMmodel leads to a bag model like mechanism for the confinement of the U(1)"color" charge inside the sine-Gordon solitons (baryons).
