Authors: Toshiaki Tanaka and Masatoshi Sato

Comments: 9 pages, Talk given at the 3rd International Sakharov Conference on

Physics, Moscow, June 2002Through a nonperturbative analysis on a sextic triple-well potential, wereveal novel aspects of the dynamical property of the system in connection withN-fold supersymmetry and quasi-solvability.
