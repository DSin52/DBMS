Using two new well defined 4-dimensional potential vectors, we formulate theclassical Maxwell's field theory in a form which has manifest Lorentzcovariance and SO(2) duality symmetry in the presence of magnetic sources. Weset up a consistent Lagrangian for the theory. Then from the action principlewe get both Maxwell's equation and the equation of motion of a dyon moving inthe electro-magnetic field.
