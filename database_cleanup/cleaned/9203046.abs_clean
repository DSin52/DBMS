We analyse the fusion, braiding and scattering properties of discretenon-abelian anyons. These occur in (2+1)-dimensional theories where a gaugegroup G is spontaneously broken down to some discrete subgroup H. We identifythe quantumnumbers of the electrically and magnetically charged sectors of theremaining discrete gauge theory, and show that on the quantum level thesymmetry group H is extended to the (quasi-triangular) Hopf algebra D(H). Mostof our considerations are relevant for discrete gauge theories in(3+1)-dimensional space time as well.
