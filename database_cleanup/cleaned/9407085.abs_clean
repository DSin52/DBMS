We study the pairwise interaction of reggeized gluons and quarks in the Reggelimit of perturbative QCD. The interactions are represented as integral kernelsin the transverse momentum space and as operators in the impact parameterspace. We observe conformal symmetry and holomorphic factorization in allcases.
