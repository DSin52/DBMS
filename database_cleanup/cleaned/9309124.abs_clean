We identify and examine a generalization of topological sigma models suitablefor coupling to topological open strings. The targets are Kahler manifolds witha real structure, i.e. with an involution acting as a complex conjugation,compatible with the Kahler metric. These models satisfy axioms of what might becalled ``equivariant topological quantum field theory,'' generalizing theaxioms of topological field theory as given by Atiyah. Observables of theequivariant topological sigma models correspond to cohomological classes in anequivariant cohomology theory of the targets. Their correlation functions canbe computed, leading to intersection theory on instanton moduli spaces with anatural real structure. An equivariant $CP^1\times CP^1$ model is discussed indetail, and solved explicitly. Finally, we discuss the equivariant formulationof topological gravity on surfaces of unoriented open and closed string theory,and find a $Z_2$ anomaly explaining some problems with the formulation oftopological open string theory.
