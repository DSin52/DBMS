We consider a general brane construction for realizing chiralfour-dimensional gauge theories. The advantage of the construction is thesimplicity and the possibility of realizing a large class of models existing inthe literature. We start the study of these models by determining the mattercontent and the superpotential which naturally arise in the brane construction.
