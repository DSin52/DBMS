Exact expressions for the partition functions of the rigid string andmembrane at any temperature are obtained in terms of hypergeometric functions.By using zeta function regularization methods, the results are analyticallycontinued and written as asymptotic sums of Riemann-Hurwitz zeta functions,which provide very good numerical approximations with just a few first terms.This allows to obtain systematic corrections to the results of Polchinski etal., corresponding to the limits $T\rightarrow 0$ and $T\rightarrow \infty$ ofthe rigid string, and to analyze the intermediate range of temperatures. Inparticular, a way to obtain the Hagedorn temperature for the rigid membrane isthus found.
