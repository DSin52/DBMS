We apply quantum group methods for noncommutative geometry to the $Z_2\timesZ_2$ lattice to obtain a natural Dirac operator on this discrete space. Thisthen leads to an interpretation of the Higgs fields as the discrete part ofspacetime in the Connes-Lott formalism for elementary particle Lagrangians. Themodel provides a setting where both the quantum groups and the Connes approachto noncommutative geometry can be usefully combined, with some of Connes'axioms, notably the first-order condition, replaced by algebraic methods basedon the group structure. The noncommutative geometry has nontrivial cohomologyand moduli of flat connections, both of which we compute.
