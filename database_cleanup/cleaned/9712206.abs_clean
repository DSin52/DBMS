We illustrate the various ways in which the algebraic framework ofnoncommutative geometry naturally captures the short-distance spacetimeproperties of string theory. We describe the noncommutative spacetimeconstructed from a vertex operator algebra and show that its algebraicproperties bear a striking resemblence to some structures appearing in MTheory, such as the noncommutative torus. We classify the inner automorphismsof the space and show how they naturally imply the conventional dualitysymmetries of the quantum geometry of spacetime. We examine the problem ofconstructing a universal gauge group which overlies all of the dynamicalsymmetries of the string spacetime. We also describe some aspects of toroidalcompactifications with a light-like coordinate and show how certain generalizedKac-Moody symmetries, such as the Monster sporadic group, arise as gaugesymmetries of the resulting spacetime and of superstring theories.
