Recently, a new constraint on the structure of a wide class of stronglycoupled field theories has been proposed. It takes the form of an inequalitylimiting the number of degrees of freedom in the infrared description of atheory to be no larger than the number of underlying, ultraviolet degrees offreedom. Here we apply this inequality to chiral gauge theories. For somemodels we find that it is always satisfied, while for others we find that theassumption of the validity of the inequality implies a strong additionalrestriction on the spectrum of massless composite particles.
