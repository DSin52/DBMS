Title: World-manifold and target space anomalies in heterotic Green-Schwarz

strings and five-branesAuthors: Kurt Lechner and Mario Tonin

Comments: 9 pages, no figures, talk given at the Conference "Gauge Theories,

Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum Gravity", London, July 1996The quantum consistency of sigma-models describing the dynamics of extendedobjects in a curved background requires the cancellation of their world-volumeanomalies, which are conformal anomalies for the heterotic string and $SO(1,5)$Lorentz-anomalies for the heterotic five-brane, and of their ten dimensionaltarget space anomalies. In determining these anomalies in a $D=10$Lorentz-covariant back-ground gauge we find that for the heterotic string theworldvolume anomalies cancel for 32 heterotic fermions while for theconjectured heterotic five-brane they cancel for only 16 heterotic fermions,this result being in contrast with the string/five-brane duality conjecture.For what concerns the target space anomalies we find that the five-braneeight-form Lorentz-anomaly polynomial differs by a factor of $1/2$ from whatis expected on the basis of duality. Possible implications of these results arediscussed.
