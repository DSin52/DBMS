In this paper we continue the study of the geometrical features of afunctional approach to classical mechanics proposed some time ago. Inparticular we try to shed some light on a N=2 "universal" supersymmetry whichseems to have an interesting interplay with the concept of ergodicity of thesystem. To study the geometry better we make this susy local and clarifypedagogically several issues present in the literature. Secondly, in order toprepare the ground for a better understanding of its relation to ergodicity, westudy the system on constant energy surfaces. We find that the procedure ofconstraining the system on these surfaces injects in it some local grassmannianinvariances and reduces the N=2 global susy to an N=1.
