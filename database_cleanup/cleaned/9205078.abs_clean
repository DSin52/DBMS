An exact conformal field theory describing a four dimensional 2-branesolution is found by considering a chiral gauged Wess-Zumino -Witten theorycorresponding to $SL(2, R)\times R$ , where one gauges the one dimensional$U(1)$ subgroup together with a translation in $R$. The backgrounds for stringpropagation are explicitly obtained and the target space is shown to have atrue curvature singularity.
