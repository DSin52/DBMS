Title: Two--poles R-matrices

Authors: M. Talon

Comments: 10 pages

We study integrable dynamical systems described by a Lax pair involving aspectral parameter. By solving the classical Yang-Baxter equation when theR-matrix has two poles we show that they can be interpreted as natural motionson a twisted loop algebra.
