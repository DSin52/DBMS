A U(1) BF-Yang-Mills theory on noncommutative ${\mathbb{R}}^4$ is presentedand in this formulation the U(1) Yang-Mills theory on noncommutative${\mathbb{R}}^4$ is seen as a deformation of the pure BF theory. Quantizationusing BRST symmetry formalism is discussed and Feynman rules are given.Computations at one-loop order have been performed and their renormalizationstudied. It is shown that the U(1) BFYM on noncommutative ${\mathbb{R}}^4$ isasymptotically free and its UV-behaviour in the computation of the$\beta$-function is like the usual SU(N) commutative BFYM and Yang Millstheories.
