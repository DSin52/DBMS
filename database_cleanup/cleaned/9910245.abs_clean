Let $M$ be a complete Einstein manifold of negative curvature, and assumethat (as in the AdS/CFT correspondence) it has a Penrose compactification witha conformal boundary $N$ of positive scalar curvature. We show that under theseconditions, $H_n(M;Z)=0$ and in particular $N$ must be connected. These resultsresolve some puzzles concerning the AdS/CFT correspondence.
