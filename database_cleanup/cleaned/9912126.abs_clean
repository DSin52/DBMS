The spin of a glueball is usually taken as coming from the spin (and possiblythe orbital angular momentum) of its constituent gluons. In light of thedifficulties in accounting for the spin of the proton from its constituentquarks, the spin of glueballs is reexamined. The starting point is thefundamental QCD field angular momentum operator written in terms of thechromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields. First, we look at the restrictionsplaced on the structure of glueballs from the requirement that the QCD fieldangular momentum operator should satisfy the standard commutationrelationships. This can be compared to the electromagnetic charge/monopolesystem, where the quantization of the field angular momentum placesrestrictions (i.e. the Dirac condition) on the system. Second, we look at theexpectation value of this operator under some simplifying assumptions.
