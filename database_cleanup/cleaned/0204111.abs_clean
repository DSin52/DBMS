The low energy dynamics of vortices in selfdual Abelian Higgs theory is ofsecond order in vortex velocity and characterized by the moduli space metric.When Chern-Simons term with small coefficient is added to the theory, we showthat a term linear in vortex velocity appears and can be consistently added tothe second order expression. We provides an additional check of the first andsecond order terms by studying the angular momentum in the field theory. Webriefly explore other first order term due to small background electric chargedensity and also the harmonic potential well for vortices given by the momentof inertia.
