A physical applicability of normed split-algebras, such as hyperbolicnumbers, split-quaternions and split-octonions is considered. We argue that theobservable geometry can be described by the algebra of split-octonions, whichis naturally equipped by zero divisors (the elements of split- algebrascorresponding to zero norm). In such a picture physical phenomena are describedby the ordinary elements of chosen algebra, while the zero divisors give raisethe coordinatization and two fundamental constants, namely velocity of lightand Planck constant. It turns to be possible that uncertainty principle appearsfrom the condition of positively defined norm, and has the same geometricalmeaning as the existence of the maximal value of speed. The property ofnon-associativity of octonions could correspond to the appearance offundamental probabilities in physics. Grassmann elements and anon-commutativity of space coordinates, which are widely used in variousphysical theories, appear naturally in our approach.
