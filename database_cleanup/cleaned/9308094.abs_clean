We formulate a new geometrical string on the euclidean lattice. It ispossible to find such spin systems with local interaction which reproduce thesame surface dynamics.In the three-dimensional case this spin system is a usualIsing ferromagnet with additional diagonal antiferromagnetic interaction andwith specially adjusted coupling constants. In the four-dimensional case thespin system coincides with the gauge Ising system with an additionaldouble-plaquette interaction and also with specially tuned coupling constants.We extend this construction to random walks and random hypersurfaces (membraneand p-branes) of high dimensionality. We compare these spin systems with theeight-vertex model and BNNNI models.
