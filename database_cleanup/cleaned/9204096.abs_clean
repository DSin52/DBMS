We argue that the infinitely many gauge symmetries of string theory providean infinite set of conserved (gauge) quantum numbers (W-hair) whichcharacterise black hole states and maintain quantum coherence, even duringexotic processes like black hole evaporation/decay. We study ways of measuringthe W-hair of spherically-symmetric four-dimensional objects with eventhorizons, treated as effectively two-dimensional string black holes.Measurements can be done either through the s-wave scattering of lightparticles off the string black-hole background, or through interferenceexperiments of Aharonov-Bohm type. We also speculate on the role of theextended W-symmetries possessed by the topological field theories that describethe region of space-time around a singularity.
