Title: Dual N=2 SUSY Breaking

Authors: I. Antoniadis and T.R. Taylor

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX. Talk presented at the CERN Workshop on

"STU-Dualities and Non-Perturbative Phenomena in Superstrings andSupergravity", and at the 2nd US-Polish Workshop on "Physics from PlanckScale to Electroweak Scale"Journal-ref: Fortsch.Phys. 44 (1996) 487-492

We discuss spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in $N=2$ globallysupersymmetric theories describing abelian vector multiplets. The most generalform of the action admits, in addition to the usual Fayet-Iliopoulos term, amagnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos term for the auxiliary components of dual vectormultiplets. In a generic case, this leads to a spontaneous breakdown of one ofthe two supersymmetries. In some cases however, dyon condensation restores$N=2$ SUSY vacuum. This talk is based on the work done in collaboration with H.Partouche \cite{apt}.
