A covariant formalism for Moyal deformations of gauge theory and differentialequations which determine Seiberg-Witten maps is presented. Replacing theordinary product of functions by the noncommutative Moyal product,noncommutative versions of integrable models can be constructed. We explore howa Seiberg-Witten map acts in such a framework. As a specific example, weconsider a noncommutative extension of the principal chiral model.
