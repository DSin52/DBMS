We present numerical evidence that a simple variational improvement of theordinary perturbation theory of the quantum anharmonic oscillator can give aconvergent sequence of approximations even in the extreme strong couplinglimit, the purely anharmonic case. Some of the new techniques of this paper canbe extended to renormalizable field theories.
