The target space theory of the N=(2,1) heterotic string may be interpreted asa theory of gravity coupled to matter in either $1+1$ or $2+1$ dimensions.Among the target space theories in $1+1$ dimensions are the bosonic, type II,and heterotic string world sheet field theories in a physical gauge. The $2+1$dimensional version describes a consistent quantum theory of supermembranes in$10+1$ dimensions. The unifying framework for all of these vacua is a theory of$2+2$ dimensional self-dual geometries embedded in $10+2$ dimensions. There arealso indications that the N=(2,1) string describes the strong coupling dynamicsof compactifications of critical string theories to two dimensions, and maylead to insights about the fundamental degrees of freedom of the theory.
