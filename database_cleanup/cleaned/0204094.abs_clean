A field theory approach to summing threshold effects to the gauge couplingsin a two-torus compactification is presented and the link with the (heterotic)string calculation is carefully investigated. We analyse whether the completeUV behaviour of the theory may be described on pure field theory grounds, asdue to momentum modes only, and address the role of the winding modes, notincluded by the field theory approach. ``Non-decoupling'' effects in the lowenergy limit, due to a small dimension are discussed. The role of modularinvariance in ensuring a finite (heterotic) string result is addressed.
