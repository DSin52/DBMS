In 2+1 dimensional gravity, a dreibein and the compatible spin connection canrepresent a space-time containing a closed spacelike surface $\Sigma$ only ifthe associated SO(2,1) bundle restricted to $\Sigma$ has the samenon-triviality (Euler class) as that of the tangent bundle of $\Sigma.$ Weimpose this bundle condition on each external state of Witten'stopology-changing amplitude. The amplitude is non-vanishing only if thecombination of the space topologies satisfies a certain selection rule. Weconstruct a family of transition paths which reproduce all the allowedcombinations of genus $g \ge 2$ spaces.
