We propose a new BRST-like quantization procedure which is applicable todynamical systems containing both first and second class constraints. Itrequires no explicit separation into first and second class constraints andtherefore no conversion of second class constraints is needed. The basicingredient is instead an invariant projection operator which projects out themaximal subset of constraints in involution. The hope is that the method willenable a covariant quantization of models for which there is no covariantseparation into first and second class constraints. An example of this type isgiven.
