In a recent paper, the BRST formalism for the gauge-fixed N=2 twistor-stringwas used to calculate Green-Schwarz supersring scattering amplitudes with anarbitrary number of loops and external massless states. Although thegauge-fixing procedure preserved the worldsheet N=2 superconformal invarianceof the twistor-string, it broke the target-space SO(9,1) super-Poincar\'einvariance down to an SU(4)xU(1) subgroup. In this paper, generators for theSO(9,1) super-Poincar\'e transformations, as well as manifestly covariantvertex operators, are explicitly constructed out of the gauge-fixed matterfields. The earlier calculated amplitudes are then expressed in manifestlyLorentz-covariant notation.
