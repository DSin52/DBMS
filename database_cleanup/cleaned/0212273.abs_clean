Within the class of integrable Calogero models associated with (semi-)simpleLie algebras and with symmetric pairs of Lie algebras identified in a previouspaper, we analyze whether and to what extent it is possible to find a gaugetransformation that takes the traditional Lax pair with its dynamical R-matrixto a new Lax pair with a numerical R-matrix.
