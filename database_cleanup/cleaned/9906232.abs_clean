Title: Probing partially localized supergravity background of fundamental

string ending on Dp-braneComments: 20 pages, LaTeX, revised version to appear in Phys. Rev. D

We study the dynamics of the probe fundamental string in the field backgroundof the partially localized supergravity solution for the fundamental stringending on Dp-brane. We separately analyze the probe dynamics for its motionalong the worldvolume direction and the transverse direction of the sourceDp-brane. We compare the dynamics of the probe along the Dp-brane worldvolumedirection to the BIon dynamics.
