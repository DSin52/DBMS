Authors: D. Bahns

Comments: 6 pages. To appear in the proceedings of 35th International Symposium

String / M Theory and Field Theory, Berlin, Germany, 26-30 Aug 2002 (specialabstractThis is the written version of a talk I gave at the 35th Symposium Ahrenshoopin Berlin, Germany, August 2002. It is an exposition of joint work with S.Doplicher, K. Fredenhagen, and Gh. Piacitelli [1]. The violation of unitarityfound in quantum field theory on noncommutative spacetimes in the context ofthe so-called modified Feynman rules is linked to the notion of time orderingimplicitely used in the assumption that perturbation theory may be done interms of Feynman propagators. Two alternative approaches which do not entail aviolation of unitarity are sketched. An outlook upon our more recent work isgiven.
