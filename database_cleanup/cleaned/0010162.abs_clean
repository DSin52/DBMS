In this paper we derive the general expression of a one-loop effectivepotential of the nonintegrable phases of Wilson lines for an SU(N) gauge theorywith a massless adjoint fermion defined on the spactime manifold$R^{1,d-3}\times T^2$ at finite temperature and fermion density. The Phasestructure of the vacuum is presented for the case with $d=4$ and N=2 at zerotemperature. It is found that gauge symmetry is broken and restored alternatelyas the fermion density increases, a feature not found in the Higgs mechanism.It is the manifestation of the quantum effects of the nonintegrable phases.
