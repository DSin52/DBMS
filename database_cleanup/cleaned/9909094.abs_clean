Motivated by a system consisting of a number of parallel M5-branes, we studypossible local deformations of a chiral two-form in six dimensions. Working tofirst order in the coupling constant, this reduces to the study of the localBRST cohomological group at ghost number zero. We obtain an exhaustive list ofall possible deformations. None of them allows for a satisfactory formulationof the M5-branes system leading to the conclusion that no local field theorycan describe such a system.
