Using a Hamiltonian approach to gauged WZW models, we present a generalmethod for computing the conformally exact metric and dilaton, to all orders inthe $1/k$ expansion, for any bosonic, heterotic, or type-II superstring modelsuperstrings the conformally exact metric and dilaton are identical to those ofthe non-supersymmetric {\it semi-classical} bosonic model except for an overallrenormalization of the metric obtained by $k\to k- g$. (ii) The exactexpressions for the heterotic superstring are derived from their exact bosonicstring counterparts by shifting the central extension $k\to 2k-h$ (but anoverall factor $(k-g)$ remains unshifted). (iii) The combination$e^\Phi\sqrt{-G}$ is independent of $k$ and therefore can be computed in lowestorder perturbation theory as required by the correct formulation of aconformally invariant path integral measure. The general formalism is appliedto the coset models $SO(d-1,2)_{-k}/SO(d-1,1)_{-k}$ that are relevant forstring theory on curved spacetime. Explicit expressions for the conformallyexact metric and dilaton for the cases $d=2,3,4$ are given. In thesemiclassical limit $(k\to \infty)$ our results agree with those obtained withthe Lagrangian method up to 1-loop in perturbation theory.
