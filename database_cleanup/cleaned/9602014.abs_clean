Extreme black holes with 1/8 of unbroken N=8 supersymmetry are characterizedby the non-vanishing area of the horizon. The central charge matrix has fourgeneric eigenvalues. The area is proportional to the square root of theinvariant quartic form of $E_{7(7)}$. It vanishes in all cases when 1/4 or 1/2of supersymmetry is unbroken. The supergravity non-renormalization theorem forthe area of the horizon in N=8 case protects the unique U-duality invariant.
