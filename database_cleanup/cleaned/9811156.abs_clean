We derive WKB expressions for glueball masses of various finite temperaturesupergravity models. The results are very close to recent numericalcomputations. We argue that the spectra has some universality that depends onlyon the dimension of the AdS space and the singularity structure of the horizon.This explains the stability of the $0^{++}$ glueball mass ratios betweenvarious models. We also consider the recently proposed nonsupersymmetric modelarising from the type 0 string. In the supergravity limit of this model, theheavy quark potential has an effective coupling with 1/(log u) behavior in theUV. Unfortunately, the supergravity solution implies that the heavy quarkpotential is still coulombic in the infrared, with an effective coupling oforder 1. We also argue that the type 0 supergravity background solution doesnot have normalizable glueball solutions.
