We make a precision test of a recently proposed conjecture relatingChern-Simons gauge theory to topological string theory on the resolution of theconifold. First, we develop a systematic procedure to extract string amplitudesfrom vacuum expectation values (vevs) of Wilson loops in Chern-Simons gaugetheory, and then we evaluate these vevs in arbitrary irreduciblerepresentations of SU(N) for torus knots. We find complete agreement with thepredictions derived from the target space interpretation of the stringamplitudes. We also show that the structure of the free energy of topologicalopen string theory gives further constraints on the Chern-Simons vevs. Our workprovides strong evidence towards an interpretation of knot polynomialinvariants as generating functions associated to enumerative problems.
