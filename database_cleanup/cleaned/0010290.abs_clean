In conformally invariant quantum field theories one encounters besides thestandard DHR superselection theory based on spacelike (Einstein-causal)commutation relations and their Haag duality another timelike (''Huygens'')based superselection structure. Whereas the DHR theory based on spacelikecausality of observables confirmed the Lagrangian internal symmetry picture onthe level of the physical principles of local quantum physics, the attempts tounderstand the timelike based superselection charges (associated with thecenter of the conformal covering group) in terms of timelike localized chargeslead to a more dynamical role of charges outside the DR theorem and evenoutside the Coleman-Mandula setting. The ensuing plektonic timelike structureof conformal theories explains the spectrum of the anomalous scale dimensionsin terms of phase factors in admissable braid group representations, similar tothe explanation of the possible anomalous spin spectrum expected fromstringlike d=1+2 fields with braid group statistics.
