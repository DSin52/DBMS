We evaluate the spectral function of scalar and spinor propagator in threedimensional quantum electrodynamics with the use of Ward-Identity forsoft-photon emission vertex. Exponentation of one-photon matrix element yieldsa fll propagator in position space.It has a simple form as free propagatormultiplied by quantum correction.But this is not a integrable function so thatanalysis in momentum space is not easy.Term by term integral converges and theyhave a logarithmic singuralities associated with renormalized mass inperturbation theory.Renormalization constant vanishes for weak coupling,whichsuggests confinement of charged particle.There exists a critical couplingconstant below which bare mass vanishes and the vacuum expectationvalue of paircondensation is finite.
