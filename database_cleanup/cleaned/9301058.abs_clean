Hawking's radiance, even as computed without account of backreaction, departsfrom blackbody form due to the mode dependence of the barrier penetrationfactor. Thus the radiation is not the maximal entropy radiation for givenenergy. By comparing estimates of the actual entropy emission rate with themaximal entropy rate for the given power, and using standard ideas fromcommunication theory, we set an upper bound on the permitted informationoutflow rate. This is several times the rates of black hole entropy decrease orradiation entropy production. Thus, if subtle quantum effects not heretoforeaccounted for code information in the radiance, the information that wasthought to be irreparably lost down the black hole may gradually leak back outfrom the black hole environs over the full duration of the hole's evaporation.
