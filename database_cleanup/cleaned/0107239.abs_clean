We extend the gauge coupling of Super-Yang-Mills theories to an externalsuperfield composed out of a chiral and an antichiral superfield and performrenormalization in the extended model. In one-loop order we find an anomalousbreaking of supersymmetry which vanishes in the limit to constant coupling. Theanomaly arises form non-local contributions and its coefficient is gauge andscheme independent and strictly of one-loop order. In the perturbativeframework of the construction the anomaly cannot be absorbed as a countertermto the classical action. With local gauge coupling the symmetric countertermswith chiral integration are holomorphic functions and this property isindependent from the specific regularization scheme. Thus, the symmetriccounterterm to the Yang-Mills part is of one-loop order only - and it is theanomaly which gives rise to the two-loop order of the gauge $\beta$-function inpure Super-Yang-Mills theories and to its closed all-order expression.
