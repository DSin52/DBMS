Using explicit expressions for a class of singular vectors of the $N=2$(untwisted) algebra and following the approach of Malikov-Feigin-Fuchs andKent, we show that the analytically extended Verma modules contain two linearlyindependent neutral singular vectors at the same grade. We construct this twodimensional space and we identify the singular vectors of the original Vermamodules. We show that in some Verma modules these expressions lead to twolinearly independent singular vectors which are at the same grade and have thesame charge.
