In another application of the methods of Henneaux, Teitelboim, and Vergaradeveloped for diffeomorphisms invariant models, the CGHS theory of 2D blackholes is focused in order to obtain the true degrees of freedom, the simplecticstructure and the {\it effective} Hamiltonian that rules the dynamics inreduced phase-space.
