Starting from the working hypothesis that both physics and the correspondingmathematics have to be described by means of discrete concepts on the Planckscale, one of the many problems one has to face in this enterprise is to findthe discrete protoforms of the building blocks of our ordinary continuumphysics and mathematics. We base our own approach on what we call `cellularnetworks', consisting of cells (nodes) interacting with each other via bonds(figuring as elementary interactions) according to a certain `local law'.Geometrically our dynamical networks are living on graphs. Hence a substantialamount of the investigation is devoted to the developement of various versionsof discrete (functional) analysis and geometry on such (almost random) webs.Another important topic we address is a suitable concept of intrinsic (fractal)dimension on erratic structures of this kind. In the course of theinvestigation we make comments concerning both different and related approachesto quantum gravity as, say, the spin network framework. It may perhaps be saidthat certain parts of our programme seem to be a realisation of ideas sketchedby Smolin some time ago (see the introduction).
