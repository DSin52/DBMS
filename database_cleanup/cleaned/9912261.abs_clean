Title: Intersecting Branes and Generalized Vortices

Authors: Takao Suyama

Comments: 10 pages

We construct the effective theory of intersecting branes and investigate theBPS monopoles in the theory. The monopoles obtained are the generalization ofNielsen-Olesen vortex. We study the properties of the solutions and interpretthem as the D0-branes on the brane-intersections.
