The gauge dependence of the effective action of composite fields for generalgauge theories in the framework of the quantization method by Batalin, Lavrovand Tyutin is studied. The corresponding Ward identities are obtained. Thevariation of composite fields effective action is found in terms of new set ofoperators depending on composite field. The theorem of the on-shell gaugefixing independence for the effective action of composite fields in suchformalism is proved. brief discussion of gravitational-vector inducedinteraction for Maxwell theory with composite fields is given.
