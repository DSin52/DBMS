We discuss the cosmological constant problem in the context of highercodimension brane world scenarios with infinite-volume extra dimensions. Inparticular, by adding higher curvature terms in the bulk action we are able tofind smooth solutions with the property that the 4-dimensional part of thebrane world-volume is flat for a range of positive values of the brane tension.
