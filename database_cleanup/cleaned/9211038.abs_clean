We consider a continuous model of D-dimensional elastic (polymerized)manifold fluctuating in d-dimensional Euclidean space, interacting with asingle impurity via an attractive or repulsive delta-potential (but withoutself-avoidance interactions). Except for D=1 (the polymer case), this modelcannot be mapped onto a local field theory. We show that the use of intrinsicdistance geometry allows for a rigorous construction of the high-temperatureperturbative expansion and for analytic continuation in the manifold dimensionD. We study the renormalization properties of the model for 0<D<2, and showthat for d<d* where d*=2D/(2-D) is the upper critical dimension, theperturbative expansion is UV finite, while UV divergences occur as poles atd=d*. The standard proof of perturbative renormalizability for local fieldtheories (the BPH theorem) does not apply to this model. We prove perturbativerenormalizability to all orders by constructing a subtraction operator based ona generalization of the Zimmermann forests formalism, and which makes thetheory finite at d=d*. This subtraction operation corresponds to arenormalization of the coupling constant of the model (strength of theinteraction with the impurity). The existence of a Wilson function, of anepsilon-expansion around the critical dimension, of scaling laws for d<d* inthe repulsive case, and of non-trivial critical exponents of the delocalizationtransition for d>d* in the attractive case is thus established. To ourknowledge, this provides the first proof of renormalizability for a model ofextended objects, and should be applicable to the study of self-avoidanceinteractions for random manifolds.
