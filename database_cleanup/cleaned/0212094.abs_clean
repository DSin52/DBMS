Title: Noncommutative fields in curved space

Authors: J. Barcelos-Neto

Comments: 4 pages, Revtex 4, twocolumn

We consider a noncommutative theory developed in a curved background. We showthat the Moyal product has to be conveniently modified and, consequently, someof its old properties are lost compared with the flat case. We also address thequestion of diffeomorphism symmetry.
