Olmo, M. Santander and J. M. Guilarte, Ciemat, 1993, 35-54This paper is an expanded version of a talk given at the XIX InternationalColloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics, Salamanca, July, 1992.We discuss the geometry of topological terms in classical actions, which bythemselves form the actions of topological field theories. We first treat theChern-Simons action directly. Then we explain how the geometry is bestunderstood via integration of smooth Deligne cocycles. We conclude with someremarks about the corresponding quantum theories in 3 and 4 dimensions.This paper is written using AMSTeX 2.1, which can be obtained via ftp fromthe American Mathematical Society (instructions included).
