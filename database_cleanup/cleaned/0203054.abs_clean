We analyze some consequences of two possible interpretations of the action ofthe ladder operators emerging from generalized Heisenberg algebras in theframework of the second quantized formalism. Within the first interpretation weconstruct a quantum field theory that creates at any space-time point particlesdescribed by a q-deformed Heisenberg algebra and we compute the propagator anda specific first order scattering process. Concerning the second one, we drawattention to the possibility of constructing this theory where each state of ageneralized Heisenberg algebra is interpreted as a particle with differentmass.
