Title: A 3+1 Dimensional LF-Model with Spontaneous $\chi SB$

Comments: 6 pages, LaTex, 1 figure, invited talk at International Workshop on

``New Nonperturbative Methods and Quantization on the Light Cone'', LesHouches, France, Feb. 24 - March 7, 1997We investigate a 3+1 dimensional toy model that exhibits spontaneousbreakdown of chiral symmetry, both in a light-front (LF) Hamiltonian and in aEuclidean Schwinger-Dyson (SD) formulation. We show that both formulations arecompletely equivalent --- provided the renormalization is properly done. Forthe model considered, this means that if one uses the same transverse momentumcutoff on the SD and LF formulations then the vertex mass in the LF calculationmust be taken to be the same as the current quark mass in the SD calculation.The kinetic mass term in the LF calculation is renormalized non-trivially,which is eventually responsible for the mass generation of the physical fermionof the model.
