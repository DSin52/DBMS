We study the analogue of the Oppenheimer-Snyder model of a collapsing sphereof homogeneous dust on the Randall-Sundrum type brane. We show that thecollapsing sphere has the Vaidya radiation envelope which is followed by thebrane analogue of the Schwarzschild solution described by theReissner-Nordstrom metric. The collapsing solution is matched to the branegeneralized Vaidya solution and which in turn is matched to theReissner-Nordstrom metric. The mediation by the Vaidya radiation zone is thenew feature introduced by the brane. Since the radiating mediation isessential, we are led to the remarkable conclusion that a collapsing sphere onthe brane does indeed, in contrast to general relativity, radiate nullradiation.
