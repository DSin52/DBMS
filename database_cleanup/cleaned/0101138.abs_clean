We find exact solutions of the Einstein equations which describe a black holepierced by infinitely thin cosmic strings. The string segments enter the blackhole along the radii and their positions coincide with the symmetry axes of aregular polyhedron. Each string produces an angle deficit proportional to itstension, while the metric outside the strings is locally Schwarzschild one.There are three configurations corresponding to tetrahedra, octahedra andicosahedra where the number of string segments is 14, 26 and 62, respectively.There is also a "double pyramid" configuration where the number of stringsegments is not fixed. There can be two or three independent types of stringsin one configuration. Tensions of strings belonging to the same type are equal.Analogous polyhedral multi-string configurations can be combined with otherspherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations.
