Lines generated by marginal deformations of WZW models are considered. TheWeyl symmetry at the WZW point implies the existence of a duality symmetry onsuch lines. The duality is interpreted as a broken gauge symmetry in stringtheory. It is shown that at the two end points the axial and vector cosets areobtained. This shows that the axial and vector cosets are equivalent CFTs bothin the compact and the non-compact cases. Moreover, it is shown that there are$\s$-model deformations that interpolate smoothly between manifolds withdifferent topologies.
