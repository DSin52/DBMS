In the Matrix Quantum Mechanical formulation of 2D string theory it ispossible to introduce arbitrary tachyonic perturbations. In the case when thetachyonic momenta form a lattice, the theory is known to be integrable and,therefore, it can be used to describe the corresponding string theory. We studythe backgrounds of string theory obtained from these matrix model solutions.They are found to be flat but the perturbations can change the global structureof the target space. They can lead either to a compactification, or to thepresence of boundaries depending on the choice of boundary conditions. Thus, weargue that the tachyon perturbations have a dual description in terms of theunperturbed theory in spacetime with a non-trivial global structure.
