The Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with the matter degrees of freedom isconsidered. The classical model is exactly solvable and its solutions describenon-trivial gravitational scattering of matter wave-packets. For huge amount ofthe solutions the scattering space-times are free of curvature singularities.However, the quantum corrections to the field equations inevitably cause theformation of (thunderbolt) curvature singularities, vanishing only in the limit$\hbar\to 0$. The singularities cut the space-time and disallow propagation tothe future.The model is inspired by the dimensional reduction of 4-d pureEinstein gravity, restricted to the space-times with two commuting space-likeKilling vectors. The matter degrees of freedom also stem from the 4-d ansatz.The measures for the continual integrations are judiciously chosen and one loopcontributions (including the graviton and the dilaton ones) are evaluated. Forthe number of the matter fields $N=24$ we obtain even the exact effectiveaction, applying the DDK-procedure. The effective action is nonlocal, but thesemiclassical equations can be solved by using some theory of the Hankeltransformations.
