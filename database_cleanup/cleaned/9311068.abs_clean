Title: Particle Physics Models, Grand Unification, and Gravity in

Non-Commutative GeometryAuthors: A.H. Chamseddine and J. Fr\"ohlich

Comments: 17 pages, A talk presented by first author in the Salamfest, May 1993

We review the construction of particle physics models in the framework ofnon-commutative geometry. We first give simple examples, and then progress tooutline the Connes-Lott construction of the standard Weinberg-Salam model andour construction of the SO(10) model. We then discuss the analogue of theEinstein-Hilbert action and gravitational matter couplings. Finally wespeculate on some experimental signatures of predictions specific to thenon-commutative approach.
