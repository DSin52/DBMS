Solutions of Einstein's equations are found for global defects in ahigher-dimensional spacetime with a nonzero cosmological constant Lambda. Thedefect has a (p-1)-dimensional core (brane) and a `hedgehog' scalar fieldconfiguration in the n extra dimensions. For Lambda = 0 and n > 2, thesolutions are characterized by a flat brane worldsheet and a solid angledeficit in the extra dimensions. For Lambda > 0, one class of solutionsdescribes spherical branes in an inflating higher-dimensional universe.Instantons obtained by a Euclidean continuation of such solutions describequantum nucleation of the entire inflating brane-world, or of a spherical branein an inflating higher-dimensional universe. For Lambda < 0, one class ofsolutions exhibits an exponential warp factor. It is similar to spacetimespreviously discussed by Randall and Sundrum for n = 1 and by Gregory for n = 2.
