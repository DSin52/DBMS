Poincare lemmaAuthors: Xavier Bekaert and Nicolas Boulanger

Using a mathematical framework which provides a generalization of the de Rhamcomplex (well-designed for p-form gauge fields), we study the gauge structureand duality properties of theories for free gauge fields transforming inarbitrary irreducible representations of GL(D,R). We prove a generalization ofthe Poincare lemma which enables us to solve the above-mentioned problems in asystematic and unified way.
