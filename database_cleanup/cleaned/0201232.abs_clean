We consider a minimally coupled massless scalar propagating in the backgroundof NS5-branes in the presence of a 2-form RR electric field. The supergravitysolution also called the (NS5,D1) bound state in the appropriate decouplinglimit is the holographic dual of Open D-string (OD1) theory. Using thisinformation, we compute the two-point function of the operators in OD1 theorywhich couples to the massless string states such as the dilaton. We willindicate how to obtain the absorption cross-section of a scalar on NS5-branes(i.e. Little String Theory (LST)) obtained earlier, from our results in thelow-energy limit.
