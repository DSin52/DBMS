Title: Duality Principle and Braided Geometry

Comments: 24 pages

We give an overview of a new kind symmetry in physics which exists betweenobservables and states and which is made possible by the language of Hopfalgebras and quantum geometry. It has been proposed by the author as a featureof Planck scale physics. More recent work includes corresponding results at thesemiclassical level of Poisson-Lie groups and at the level of braided groupsand braided geometry.
