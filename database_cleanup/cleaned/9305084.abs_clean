Title: Representations of the quantum matrix algebra $M_{q,p}(2)$

Comments: 20 pages

It is shown that the finite dimensional irreducible representaions of thequantum matrix algebra $ M_{ q,p}(2) $ ( the coordinate ring of $ GL_{q,p}(2)$) exist only when both q and p are roots of unity. In this case th e space ofstates has either the topology of a torus or a cylinder which may be thought ofas generalizations of cyclic representations.
