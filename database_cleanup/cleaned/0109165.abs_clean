Brane Gas Cosmology (BGC) is an approach to M-theory cosmology in which theinitial state of the Universe is taken to be small, dense and hot, with allfundamental degrees of freedom near thermal equilibrium. Such a starting pointis in close analogy with the Standard Big Bang (SBB) model. The topology of theUniverse is assumed to be toroidal in all nine spatial dimensions and is filledwith a gas of p-branes. The dynamics of winding modes allow, at most, threespatial dimensions to become large, thus explaining the origin of ourmacroscopic 3+1-dimensional Universe. Here we conduct a detailed analysis ofthe loitering phase of BGC. We do so by including into the equations of motionthat describe the dilaton gravity background some new equations which determinethe annihilation of string winding modes into string loops. Specific solutionsare found within the model that exhibit loitering, i.e. the Universeexperiences a short phase of slow contraction during which the Hubble radiusgrows larger than the physical extent of the Universe. As a result the braneproblem (generalized domain wall problem) in BGC is solved. The initialsingularity and horizon problems of the SBB scenario are solved without relyingon an inflationary phase.
