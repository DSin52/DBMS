The ten-dimensional superparticle is covariantly quantized by constructing aBRST operator from the fermionic Green-Schwarz constraints and a bosonic purespinor variable. This same method was recently used for covariantly quantizingthe superstring, and it is hoped that the simpler case of the superparticlewill be useful for those who want to study this quantization method. It isinteresting that quantization of the superparticle action closely resemblesquantization of the worldline action for Chern-Simons theory.
