We study the high energy, fixed angle, asymptotics of D-brane form factors toall orders in string perturbation theory, using the Gross-Mende saddle pointtechniques. The effective interaction size of all D-branes grows linearly withthe energy as (alpha') E/n, where n is the order of perturbation theory, exceptfor the D-instanton, whose form factor is dominated by end-point contributions,and remains point-like at high orders. The qualitative features are independentof the R-R or NS-NS character of the states used to probe the D-brane.
