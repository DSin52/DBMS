Some facts about von Neumann algebras and finite index inclusions of factorsare viewed in the context of local quantum field theory. The possibility oflocal fields intertwining superselection sectors with braid group statistics isexplored. Conformal embeddings and coset models serve as examples. Theassociated symmetry concept is pointed out.
