NBI-HE-93-48 (1993)We look at various features of the Standard Model with the purpose ofexploring some possibilities of how to seek physical laws beyond it, i.e. ateven smaller distances. Only parameters and structure which are not calculablefrom the Standard Model is considered useful information. Ca. $90$ bits ofinformation contained in the system of representations in the Standard Modelare explained by four reasonable postulates. A crude estimate is that there isof the order of $\sim 2 \times 10^2$ useful bits of unexplained informationleft today. There are several signs of the fact that the Standard Model is alow energy tail of a more fundamental theory (not yet known). However, someworries are expressed as concerns how far the exploration of the physics beyondthe Standard Model can proceed - if we are to be inspired from these $\sim 2\times 10^2$ bits alone.
