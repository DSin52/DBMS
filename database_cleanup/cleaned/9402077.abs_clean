Flow equations describe the evolution of the effective action $\Gamma_k$ inthe process of varying an infrared cutoff $k$. The presence of the infraredcutoff explicitly breaks gauge and hence BRS invariance. We derive modifiedSlavnov-Taylor identities, which are valid for nonvanishing $k$. They guaranteethe BRS invariance of $\Gamma_k$ for $k\to0$, and hence allow the study ofnon-abelian gauge theories by integrating the flow equations. Within aperturbative expansion of $\Gamma_k$, we derive an equation for a $k$ dependentmass term for the gauge fields implied by the modified Slavnov-Tayloridentities.
