We demonstrate the classical stability of the weak/Planck hierarchy withinthe Randall-Sundrum scenario, incorporating the Goldberger-Wise mechanism andhigher-derivative interactions in a systematic perturbative expansion. Suchhigher-derivative interactions are expected if the RS model is the low-energydescription of some more fundamental theory. Generically, higher derivativeslead to ill-defined singularities in the vicinity of effective field theorybranes. These are carefully treated by the methods of classicalrenormalization.
