We construct six- and four-dimensional toroidal compactifications of the TypeI string with magnetic flux on the D-branes. The open strings in thisbackground probe a noncommutative internal geometry. Phenomenologicallyappealing features such as chiral fermions and supersymmetry breaking in thegauge sector are naturally realized by these vacua. We investigate the spectraof such noncommutative string compactifications and in a bottom-up approachdiscuss the possibility to obtain the standard or some GUT like model.
