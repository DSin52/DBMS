We show how to find explicit expressions for rigid string instantons forgeneral 4-manifold $M$. It appears that they are pseudo-holomorphic curves inthe twistor space of $M$. We present explicit formulae for $M=R^4, S^4$. Wediscuss their properties and speculate on relations to topology of 4-manifoldsand the theory of Yang-Mills fields.
