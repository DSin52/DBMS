(this is an updated version of the original preprint)A Lagrangian treatment of the quantization of first class Hamiltonian systemswith constraints and Hamiltonian linear and quadratic in the momentarespectively is performed. The ``first reduce and then quantize'' and the``first quantize and then reduce'' (Dirac's) methods are compared. A new sourceof ambiguities in this latter approach is revealed and its relevance on issuesconcerning self-consistency and equivalence with the ``first reduce'' method isemphasized. One of our main results is the relation between the propagatorobtained {\it \`a la Dirac} and the propagator in the full space, eq. (5.25).Asan application of the formalism developed, quantization on coset spaces ofcompact Lie groups is presented. In this case it is shown that a naturalselection of a Dirac quantization allows for full self-consistency andequivalence. Finally, the specific case of the propagator on a two-dimensionalsphere $S^2$ viewed as the coset space $SU(2)/U(1)$ is worked out.
