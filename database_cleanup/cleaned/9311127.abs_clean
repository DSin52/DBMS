We construct the Poincare polynomials for Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds withprojection operators.Using them we show that special types of dualitiesincluding Poincare duality are realized under certain conditions. WhenCalabi-Yau interpretation exists, two simple formulae for Hodge numbers$h^{2,1}$ and $h^{1,1}$ are obtained.
