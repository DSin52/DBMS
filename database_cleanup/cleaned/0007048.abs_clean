It is advocated that the superembedding approach is a generic covariantmethod for the description of superbranes as models of (partial) spontaneoussupersymmetry breaking. As an illustration we construct (in the framework ofsuperembeddings) an n=1, d=3 worldvolume superfield action for a supermembranepropagating in N=1, D=4,5,7 and 11-dimensional supergravity backgrounds. Wethen show how in the case of an N=1, D=4 target superspace gauge fixing localworldvolume superdiffeomorphisms in the covariant supermembrane action resultsin an effective N=2, d=3 supersymmetric field theory with N=2 supersymmetrybeing spontaneously broken down to N=1. The broken part of N=2, d=3supersymmetry is nonlinearly realized when acting on Goldstone N=1, d=3superfields, which describe physical degrees of freedom of the model. As anintroduction to the formalism, the procedure of getting effective fieldtheories with partially broken supersymmetry by gauge fixing covariantsuperbrane actions is also demonstrated with a simpler example of a massiveN=2, D=2 superparticle.
