Superstrings propagating on backgrounds of the form AdS_3 x G/H are studiedusing the coset CFT approach. We focus on seven dimensional cosets which have asemiclassical limit, and which give rise to N=3 superconformal symmetry in thedual CFT. This is realized for the two cases AdS_3 x SU(3)/U(1) and AdS_3 xSO(5)/SO(3), for which we present an explicit construction. We also providesufficient conditions on a CFT background to enable a similar construction, andcomment on the geometrical interpretation of our results.
