"Trends in Theoretical Physics", held in Buenos Aires, December 1998We review recent work on the study of N=2 super Yang-Mills theory with gaugegroup SU(N) from the point of view of the Whitham hierarchy, mainly focusing oninstanton expansion of the low-energy effective prepotential; (ii) We interpretthe slow times of the hierarchy as additional couplings and promote them tospurion superfields that softly break N=2 supersymmetry down to N=0 throughdeformations associated to higher Casimir operators of the gauge group; (iii)We show that the Seiberg-Witten-Whitham equations provide a set of non-trivialconstraints on the form of the strong coupling expansion in the vicinity of themaximal singularities. We use them to check a proposal that we make for thevalue of the off-diagonal couplings at those points of the moduli space.
