We report results of two investigations of the double-scaling equations forthe unitary matrix models. First, the fixed area partition functions have allpositive coefficients only for the first four critical points. This impliesthat the critical points at $k\ge5$ describe non-unitary continuum theories.Secondly, we examine a conjectured connection to branched polymers, but findthat the scaling solutions of the unitary models do not agree with those of aparticular model describing branched polymers.
