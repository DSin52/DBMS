Title: Exact Critical Exponents of the Staircase Model

Authors: Michael Lassig

Comments: 7 pages

The staircase model is a recently discovered one-parameter family ofintegrable two-dimensional continuum field theories. We analyze the novelcritical behavior of this model, seen as a perturbation of a minimal conformalby all fixed points M_p, M_{p-1}, ..., M_3. The exponents of the magneticsusceptibility and the specific heat are obtained exactly. Various correctionsto scaling are discussed, among them a new type specific to crossover phenomenabetween critical fixed points.
