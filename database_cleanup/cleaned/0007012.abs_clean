There is a longstanding puzzle concerned with the existence of Op~-planeswith p>=6, which are orientifold p-planes of negative charge with stuckDp-branes. We study the consistency of configurations with various orientifoldplanes and propose a resolution to this puzzle. It is argued that O6~-planesare possible in massive IIA theory with odd cosmological constant, whileO7~-planes and O8~-planes are not allowed. Various relations betweenorientifold planes and non-BPS D-branes are also addressed.
