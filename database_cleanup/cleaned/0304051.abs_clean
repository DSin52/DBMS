We give brane-world solutions with cosmological constant $\lambda$ byintroducing the dilaton in 5d bulk, and we have examined the localization ofgraviton, gauge bosons and dilaton. For the solutions given here, we find thatboth graviton and gauge bosons can be trapped for any sign, positive andnegative, and wide range of $\lambda$ due to the dilaton. On the other hand,the bulk dilaton can not be trapped as a stable particle on a brane of$\lambda\geq 0$. This implies a possible resolution of the moduli problem andthe equivalence principle in superstring theory since the dilaton can not belocalized on the brane as a partner of the graviton.
