Title: Gauge Invariance of the Quantum Electrodynamics in the Causal Approach

to Renormalization TheoryAuthors: Dan Radu Grigore

Comments: LATEX 2e, 34 pages, the case of scalar QED also considered

We present an extremely simple solution to the renormalization of quantumelectrodynamics based on Epstein-Glaser approach to renormalization theory.
