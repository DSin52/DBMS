We study axially symmetric monopoles of both the SU(2)Yang-Mills-Higgs-Dilaton (YMHD) as well as of the SU(2)Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs-Dilaton (EYMHD) system. We find that equally togravity, the presence of the dilaton field can render an attractive phase. Wealso study the influence of a massive dilaton on the attractive phase in theYMHD system.
