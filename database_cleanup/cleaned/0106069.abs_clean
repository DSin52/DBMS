The sine-Gordon model with Neumann boundary condition is investigated. Usingthe bootstrap principle the spectrum of boundary bound states is established.Somewhat surprisingly it is found that Coleman-Thun diagrams and bound statecreation may coexist. A framework to describe finite size effects in boundaryintegrable theories is developed and used together with the truncated conformalspace approach to confirm the bound states and reflection factors derived bybootstrap.
