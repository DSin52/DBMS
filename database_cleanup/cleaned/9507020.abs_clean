The theory of Poisson-$\sigma$-models employs the mathematical notion ofPoisson manifolds to formulate and analyze a large class of topological andalmost topological two dimensional field theories. As special examples thisclass of field theories includes pure Yang-Mills and gravity theories, and, tosome extent, the G/G gauged WZW-model. The aim of this contribution is to givea pedagogical introduction, explaining many aspects of the general theory byillustrative examples.
