It is shown that the operator $B(C) = Tr [P \exp i \tilde{g} \oint\tilde{A}_i(x) dx^i]$ constructed with the recently derived dual potential$\tilde{A}(x)$ and a coupling $\tilde{g}$ related to $g$ by the Diracquantization condition satisfies the correct commutation relation with theWilson operator $Tr [P \exp ig \oint A_i(x) dx^i]$ as required by 't Hooftfor his order-disorder parameters.
