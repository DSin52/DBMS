A class of non abelian affine Toda models arising from the axial gaugedtwo-loop WZW model is presented. Their zero curvature representation isconstructed in terms of a graded Kac-Moody algebra. It is shown that thediscrete multivacua structure of the potential together with non abelian natureof the zero grade subalgebra allows soliton solutions with non trivial electricand topological charges.The dressing transformation is employed to explicitly construct one and twosoliton solutions and their bound states in terms of the tau functions. Adiscussion of the classical spectra of such solutions and the time delays aregiven in detail.
