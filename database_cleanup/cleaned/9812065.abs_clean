The left-right symmetric model (LRSM) with gauge group $SU(2)_{L} \timesSU(2)_{R} \times U(1)_{B-L}$ is reconstructed from the geometric formulation ofgauge theory in $M_4 \times Z_2 \times Z_2$ where $M_4$ is the four-dimensionalMinkowski space and $Z_2 \times Z_2$ the discrete space with four points. Thegeometrical structure of this model becomes clearer compared with other worksbased on noncommutative geometry. As a result, the Yukawa coupling terms andthe Higgs potential are derived in more restricted forms than in the standardLRSM.
