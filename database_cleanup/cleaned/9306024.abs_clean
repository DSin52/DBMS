The partition function of the discretized superstring in a target superspaceof three (Euclidean) bosonic dimensions, is shown, for a fixed triangulation ofthe random world sheet, to be derived from the partition function of adiscretized bosonic string with an external field present in the action in theform of a specific constant matrix, using first order forms of the actions.This latter partition function appears more amenable to an exact analyticaltreatment.
