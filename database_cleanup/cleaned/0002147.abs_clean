We study the Kaluza-Klein zero modes of massless bulk fields with variousspins in the background of dilatonic and self-tuning flat domain walls. We findthat the zero modes of all the massless bulk fields in such domain wallbackgrounds are normalizable, unlike those in the background of thenon-dilatonic domain wall with infinite extra space of Randall and Sundrum. Inparticular, gravity in the bulk of dilatonic domain walls is effectivelycompactified to the Einstein gravity with vanishing cosmological constant andnonzero gravitational constant in one lower dimensions for any values ofdilaton coupling parameter, provided the warp factor is chosen to decrease onboth sides of the domain wall, in which case the tension of the domain wall ispositive. However, unexpectedly, for the self-tuning flat domain walls, thecosmological constant of the zero mode effective gravity action in one lowerdimensions does not vanish, indicating the need for additional ingredient ormodification necessary in cancellation of the unexpected cosmological constantin the graviton zero mode effective action.
