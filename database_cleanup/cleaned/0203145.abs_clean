We examine whether the cosmologies with varying speed of light (VSL) arecompatible with the second law of thermodynamics. We find that the VSLcosmology with varying fundamental constant is severely constrained by thesecond law of thermodynamics, whereas the bimetric cosmological models are lessconstrained.
