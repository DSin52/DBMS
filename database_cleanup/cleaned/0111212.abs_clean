We study IIA/B string theory compactified on twisted circles. These modelspossess closed string tachyons and reduce to type 0B/A theory in a speciallimit. Using methods of gauged linear sigma models and mirror symmetry weconstruct a conformal field theory which interpolates between these models andflat space via an auxiliary Liouville direction. Interpreting motion in theLiouville direction as renormalization group flow, we argue that the end pointof tachyon condensation in all these models (including 0B/A theory) issupersymmetric type II theory. We also find a zero-slope limit of these modelswhich is best described in a T-dual picture as a type II NS-NS fluxbrane. Inthis limit tachyon condensation is an interesting and well posed problem insupergravity. We explicitly determine the tachyon as a fluctuation ofsupergravity fields, and perform a rudimentary numerical analysis of therelevant flows.
