We derive and solve the full set of scalar perturbation equations for a classof $Z_2$-symmetric five-dimensional geometries generated by a bulk cosmologicalconstant and by a 3-brane non-minimally coupled to a bulk dilaton field. Themassless scalar modes, like their tensor analogues, are localized on the brane,and provide long-range four-dimensional dilatonic interactions, which aregenerically present even when matter on the brane carries no dilatonic charge.The shorter-range corrections induced by the continuum of massive scalar modesbackground (the standard Randall--Sundrum configuration) and vanishingdilatonic charges.
