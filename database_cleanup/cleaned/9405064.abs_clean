It is shown that B\"acklund transformations (BTs) and zero-curvaturerepresentations (ZCRs) of systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) areclosely related. The connection is established by nonlinear representations ofthe symmetry group underlying the ZCR which induce gauge transformationsrelating different BTs. This connection is used to construct BTs from ZCRs (andvice versa). Furthermore a procedure is outlined which allows a systematicsearch for ZCRs of a given system of PDEs.
