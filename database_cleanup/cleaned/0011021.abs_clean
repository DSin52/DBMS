We consider the set of partition functions that result from the insertion oftwist operators compatible with conformal invariance in a given 2D ConformalField Theory (CFT). A consistency equation, which gives a classification oftwists, is written and solved in particular cases. This generalises old resultson twisted torus boundary conditions, gives a physical interpretation ofOcneanu's algebraic construction, and might offer a new route to the study ofproperties of CFT.
