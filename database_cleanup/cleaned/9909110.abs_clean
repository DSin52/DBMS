A double scaling limit can be defined in string theory on a Calabi-Yau (CY)manifold by approaching a point in moduli space where the CY space develops anisolated singularity and at the same time taking the string coupling to zero,while keeping a particular combination of the two parameters fixed. This leadsto a decoupled theory without gravity which has a weak coupling expansion, andcan be studied using a holographically dual non-critical superstringdescription. The usual ``Little String Theory'' corresponds to the strongcoupling limit of this theory. We use holography to compute two and three pointfunctions in weakly coupled double scaled little string theory, and study thespectrum of the theory in various dimensions. We find a discrete spectrum ofmasses which exhibits Hagedorn growth.
