We show that the symmetry algebra governing the interacting part of thematrix model for M-theory on the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave is the basicclassical Lie superalgebra SU(4|2). We determine the SU(4|2) multiplets presentin the exact spectrum in the limit where \mu (the mass parameter) becomesinfinite, and find that these include infinitely many BPS multiplets. Using therepresentation theory of SU(4|2), we demonstrate that some of these BPSmultiplets, including all of the vacuum states of the matrix model plus certaininfinite towers of excited states, have energies which are exactly protectednon-perturbatively for any value of \mu > 0. In the large N limit, these leadto exact quantum states of M-theory on the pp-wave. We also show explicitlythat there are certain BPS multiplets which do receive energy corrections bycombining with other BPS multiplets to form ordinary multiplets.
