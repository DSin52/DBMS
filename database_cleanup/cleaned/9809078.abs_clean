W_4 gravity is treated algebraically, represented by a set of transformationson classical fields. The Ward identities of the theory are determined byrequiring the algebra to close. The general forms for the anomalies are foundby looking for solutions to the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, and somespecific cases are considered.
