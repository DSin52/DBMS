Title: Teleportation of Quantum States

Comments: 5 pages

Bennett et al. (PRL 70, 1859 (1993)) have shown how to transfer ("teleport")an unknown spin quantum state by using prearranged correlated quantum systemsand transmission of classical information. I will show how their results can beobtained in the framework of nonlocal measurements proposed by Aharonov andAlbert I will generalize the latter to the teleportation of a quantum state ofa system with continuous variables.
