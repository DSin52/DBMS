The holographic RG flow in AdS/CFT correspondence naturally defines aholographic scheme in which the central charge c and the beta function arerelated by a universal formula. We perform some checks of that formula and wecompare it with quantum field theory expectations. We discuss alternativedefinitions of the c-function. In particular, we compare, for a particularsupersymmetric flow, the holographic c-function with the central chargecomputed directly from the two-point function of the stress-energy tensor.
