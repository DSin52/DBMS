Title: D-branes in the Euclidean $AdS_3$ and T-duality

Comments: 29 pages, LaTeX, references added

We show that D-branes in the Euclidean $AdS_3$ can be naturally associated tothe maximally isotropic subgroups of the Lu-Weinstein double of SU(2). Thispicture makes very transparent the residual loop group symmetry of the D-braneconfigurations and gives also immediately the D-branes shapes and the$\sigma$-model boundary conditions in the de Sitter T-dual of the$SL(2,C)/SU(2)$ WZW model.
