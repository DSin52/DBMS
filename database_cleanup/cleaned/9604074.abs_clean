Title: Covariant Supplementation Scheme for Infinitely Reducible First Class

ConstraintsJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B381 (1996) 105-112

For a rather broad class of dynamical systems subject to mixed fermionicfirst and second class constraints or infinitely reducible first classconstraints (IR1C), a manifestly covariant scheme of supplementation of IR1C toirreducible ones is proposed. For a model with IR1C only, an application of thescheme leads to a system with covariantly splitted and irreducible first andsecond class constraints. Modified Lagrangian formulations for theGreen--Schwarz superstring, Casalbuoni--Brink--Schwarz superparticle and Siegelsuperparticle, which reproduce the supplementation scheme, are suggested.
