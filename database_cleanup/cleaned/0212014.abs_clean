In discussions of Bousso's Covariant Entropy Bound, the Null Energy Conditionis always assumed, as a sufficient {\em but not necessary} condition whichhelps to ensure that the entropy on any lightsheet shall necessarily be finite.The spectacular failure of the Strong Energy Condition in cosmology has,however, led many astrophysicists and cosmologists to consider models of darkenergy which violate {\em all} of the energy conditions, and indeed the currentdata do not completely rule out such models. The NEC also has a questionablebulk in order to obtain a "self-tuning" theory of the cosmological constant. Inorder to investigate these proposals, we modify the Karch-Randall model byintroducing NEC-violating matter into $AdS_5$ in such a way that the branecosmological constant relaxes to zero. The entropy on lightsheets remainsfinite. However, we still find that the spacetime is fundamentally incompatiblewith the Covariant Entropy Bound machinery, in the sense that it fails theBousso-Randall consistency condition. We argue that holography probably forbidsall {\em cosmological} violations of the NEC, and that holography is in factthe fundamental physical principle underlying the cosmological version of theNEC.
