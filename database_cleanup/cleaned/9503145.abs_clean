A formula is proposed which expresses free fermion fields in 2K dimensions interms of the Cartan currents of the free fermion current algebra. This leads,in an obvious manner, to a vertex operator construction of nonabelian freefermion current algebras in arbitrary even dimension. It is conjectured thatthese ideas may generalize to a wide class of conformal field theories.
