Title: The strong magnetic field asymptotic behaviour for the fermion-induced

effective energy in the presence of a magnetic flux tubeAuthors: Pavlos Pasipoularides

Comments: 8 pages, 1 figure

The strong magnetic field behaviour of the fermion-induced effective energyin the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field, has recently attractattention, see Refs. [1,2,3,5,6]. In Ref. [3], we presented an asymptoticformula for the fermion-induced effective energy in 3+1 dimensions in thepresence of a cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous strong magnetic field offinite magnetic flux $\Phi$. However, the proof of the formula was presented ina condensed form and there are some points which were not clearly explained.The aim of this work is to present the complete proof in detail.
