We determine the low energy description of N=2 supersymmetric SU(k) productgroup theories with bifundamental and fundamental matter based on M-theoryfivebrane configurations. The dependence on moduli and scales of thecoefficients in the non-hyperelliptic Seiberg-Witten curves for these theoriesis determined by considering various field theory and brane limits. Apeculiarity in the interpretation of these curves for the vanishingbeta-function case is noted.
