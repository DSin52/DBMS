We analyze the D-branes of a type IIB string theory on an orbifoldsingularity including the possibility of discrete torsion following the work ofDouglas et al. First we prove some general results about the moduli space of apoint associated to the "regular representation" of the orbifold group. Thisincludes some analysis of the "wrapped branes" which necessarily appear whenthe orbifold singularity is not isolated. Next we analyze the stringy homologyof the orbifold using the McKay correspondence and the relationship betweenK-theory and homology. We find that discrete torsion and torsion in thisstringy homology are closely-related concepts but that they differ in general.Lastly we question to what extent the D-1 brane may be thought of as being dualto a string.
