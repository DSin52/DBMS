Quantum field theory on non-commutative spaces does not enjoy the usualultraviolet-infrared decoupling that forms the basis for conventionalrenormalization. The high momentum contributions to loop integrations can leadto unfamiliar long distance behavior which can potentially undermine naiveexpectations for the IR behavior of the theory. These "anomalies" involvenon-analytic behavior in the noncommutativity parameter Theta making the limitTheta goes to zero singular.In this paper we will analyze such effects in the one loop approximation togauge theories on non-commutative space. We will see that contrary toexpectations poles in Theta do occur and lead to large discrepancies betweenthe expected and actual infrared behavior. We find that poles in Theta areabsent in supersymmetric theories. The "anomalies" are generally still present,but only at the logarithmic level. A notable exception is non-commutative superYang Mills theory with 16 real supercharges in which anomalous effects seem tobe absent altogether.
