The quantum-mechanical problem of $N$ fermions with $\delta$-functioninteraction in a one-dimensional potential well of finite depth is solved. Itis shown that there exists exact wave function of Bethe-ansatz form in the casethat a single particle tunnels outside of the well. The Bethe-ansatz likesecular equations for the spectrum are obtained.
