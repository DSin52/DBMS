Within a Liouville approach to non-critical string theory, we discussspace-time foam effects on the propagation of low-energy particles. We find aninduced frequency-dependent dispersion in the propagation of a wave packet, andobserve that this would affect the outcome of measurements involving low-energyparticles as probes. In particular, the maximum possible order of magnitude ofthe space-time foam effects would give rise to an error in the measurement ofdistance comparable to that independently obtained in some recent heuristicquantum-gravity analyses. We also briefly compare these error estimates withthe precision of astrophysical measurements.
