In certain two-dimensional models, collapsing matter forms a black hole ifand only if the incoming energy flux exceeds the Hawking radiation rate. Nearthe critical threshold, the black hole mass is given by a universal formula interms of the distance from criticality, and there exists a scaling solutiondescribing the formation and evaporation of an arbitrarily small black hole.
