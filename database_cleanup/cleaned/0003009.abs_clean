The zero momentum sectors in effective theories of QCD coupled to pseudoreal(two colors) and real (adjoint) quarks have alternative descriptions in termsof chiral orthogonal and symplectic ensembles of random matrices. Using thiscorrespondence, we compute correlation functions of Dirac operator eigenvalueswithin a sector with an arbitrary topological charge in a presence of finitequark masses of the order of the smallest Dirac eigenvalue. These novelcorrelation functions, expressed in terms of Pfaffians, interpolate betweenknown results for the chiral and quenched limits as quark masses vary.
