Theories, Solitons and Duality, IFT-Unesp, Sao Paulo, Brasil, one referenceaddedA general and systematic construction of Non Abelian affine Toda models andits symmetries is proposed in terms of its underlying Lie algebraic structure.It is also shown that such class of two dimensional integrable models naturallyleads to the construction of a pair of actions related by T-dualitytransformations
