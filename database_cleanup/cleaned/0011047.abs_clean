The problem of describing the boundary states of unstable non-BPS D-branes oftype-II string theories in light-cone Green-Schwarz (GS) formalism isaddressed. Regarding the type II theories in light-cone gauge as differentrealizations of the $\hat{SO}(8)_{k=1}$ Kac-Moody algebra, the non-BPS D-braneboundary states of these theories are given in terms of the relevant Ishibashistates constructed in this current algebra. Using the expressions for thecurrent modes in terms of the GS variables it is straightforward to reexressthe boundary states in the GS formalism. The problem that remains is the lackof manifest SO(8) covariance in these expressions. We also derive the variousknown expressions for the BPS and non-BPS D-brane boundary states by startingwith the current algebra Ishibashi states.
