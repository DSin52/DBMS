We show that the rigidly rotating quantum thermal distribution on flatspace-time suffers from a global pathology which can be cured by introducing acylindrical mirror if and only if it has a radius smaller than that of thespeed-of-light cylinder. When this condition is met, we demonstrate numericallythat the renormalized expectation value of the energy-momentum stress tensorcorresponds to a rigidly rotating thermal bath up to a finite correction excepton the mirror where there are the usual Casimir divergences.
