theorem, references added, some typos fixedWe set up a consistent renormalizable perturbation theory of a scalar fieldin a nontrivial alpha vacuum in de Sitter space. Although one representation ofthe effective action involves non-local interactions between anti-podal points,we show the theory leads to causal physics, and we prove a spectral theorem forthe interacting two-point function. We construct the renormalized stress energytensor and show this develops no imaginary part at leading order in theinteractions, consistent with stability.
