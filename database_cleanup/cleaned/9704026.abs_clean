It is shown that the well-known non-Abelian static SU(2) black hole solutionshave rotating generalizations, provided that the hypothesis of linearizationstability is accepted. Surprisingly, this rotating branch has an asymptoticallyAbelian gauge field with an electric charge that cannot vanish, although thenon-rotating limit is uncharged. We argue that this may be related to oursecond finding, namely that there are no globally regular slowly rotatingexcitations of the particle-like Bartnik-McKinnon solutions.
