We analyze in detail supersymmetry breaking by compactification of the fifthdimension in M-theory in the compactification pattern $11d \to 5d \to 4d$ andfind that a superpotential is generated for the complex fields coming from $5d$hypermultiplets, namely the dilaton $S$ and the complex structure moduli. Usinggeneral arguments it is shown that these fields are always stabilized such thatthey don't contribute to supersymmetry breaking, which is completely saturatedby the K\"ahler moduli coming from vector multiplets.It is shown that this mechanism is the strong-coupling analog of theRohm-Witten quantization of the antisymmetric tensor field strength of stringtheories. The effect of a gaugino condensate on one of the boundaries is alsoconsidered.
