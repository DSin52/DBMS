It is proved that the moduli space of static solutions of the CP^1 model onspacetime Sigma x R, where Sigma is any compact Riemann surface, isgeodesically incomplete with respect to the metric induced by the kineticenergy functional. The geodesic approximation predicts, therefore, that lumpscan collapse and form singularities in finite time in these models.
