The canonical ADM equations are solved in terms of the conformal factor inthe instantaneous York gauge. A simple derivation is given for the solution ofthe two body problem. A geometrical characterization is given for the apparentsingularities occurring in the N-body problem and it is shown how the Garnierhamiltonian system arises in the ADM treatment by considering the timedevelopment of the conformal factor at the locations where the extrinsiccurvature tensor vanishes. The equations of motion for the position of theparticles and of the apparent singularities and also the time dependence of thelinear residues at such singularities are given by the transformation inducedby an energy momentum tensor of a conformal Liouville theory. Such an equationencodes completely the dynamics of the system.
