Compactification of M theory in the presence of G-fluxes yields N=2five-dimensional gauged supergravity with a potential that lifts allsupersymmetric vacua. We derive the effective superpotential directly from theKaluza-Klein reduction of the eleven-dimensional action on a Calabi-Yauthree-fold and compare it with the superpotential obtained by means ofcalibrations. We discuss an explicit domain wall solution, which representsfive-branes wrapped over holomorphic cycles. This solution has a ``runningvolume'' and we comment on the possibility that quantum corrections provide alower bound allowing for an AdS_5 vacuum of the 5-dimensional supergravity.
