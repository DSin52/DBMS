It has been argued by Ishikawa and Kato that by making use of a specificbosonization, $c_M=1$ string theory can be regarded as a constrainedtopological sigma model. We generalize their construction for any $(p,q)$minimal model coupled to two dimensional (2d) gravity and show that theenergy--momentum tensor and the topological charge of a constrained topologicalsigma model can be mapped to the energy--momentum tensor and the BRST charge of$c_M<1$ string theory at zero cosmological constant. We systematically studythe physical state spectrum of this topological sigma model and recover thespectrum in the absolute cohomology of $c_M<1$ string theory. This procedureprovides us a manifestly topological representation of the continuum Liouvilleformulation of $c_M<1$ string theory.
