We propose a candidate for the dual (in the weak/strong coupling sense) ofthe six-dimensional heterotic string compactification constructed recently byChaudhuri, Hockney and Lykken. It is a type IIA string theory compactified onan orbifold $K3/Z_2$, where the $Z_2$ action involves an involution of $K3$with fixed points, and also has an embedding in the U(1) gauge group associatedwith the Ramond-Ramond sector of the type IIA string theory. This introducesflux of the U(1) gauge field concentrated at the orbifold points. Thisconstruction provides an explicit example where the dual of a super-conformalfield theory background of the heterotic string theory is not a standardsuper-conformal field theory background of the type IIA string theory.
