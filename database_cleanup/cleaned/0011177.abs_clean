We explore physics on the boundary of a Randall-Sundrum type model when thebrane tension is slightly sub-critical. We calculate the masses of theKaluza-Klein decomposition of the graviton and use a toy model to show howlocalized gravity emerges as the brane tension becomes critical. Finally, wediscuss some aspects of the boundary conformal field theory and the AdS/CFTcorrespondence.
