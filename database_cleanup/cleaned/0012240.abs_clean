We present a menagerie of solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations in six,eight and ten dimensions. These solutions describe spacetimes which are eitherlocally asymptotically adS or locally asymptotically flat, and which havenon-trivial topology. We discuss the global structure of these solutions, andtheir relevance within the context of M-theory.
