Title: Symmetric designs on Lie algebras and interactions of hamiltonian

systems.Nonhamiltonian interaction of hamiltonian systems is considered. Dynamicalequations are constructed by use of symmetric designs on Lie algebras. Theresults of analysis of these equations show that some class of symmetricdesigns on Lie algebras beyond Jordan ones may be useful for a description ofalmost periodic, asymptotically periodic, almost asymptotically periodic, and,possibly, more chaotic systems. However, the behaviour of systems related tosymmetric designs with additional identities is simpler than for general onesfrom different points of view. These facts confirm a general thesis thatvarious algebraic structures beyond Lie algebras may be regarded as certaincharacteristics for a wide class of dynamical systems.
