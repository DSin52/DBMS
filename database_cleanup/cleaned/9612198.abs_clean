Title: Quaternions and M(atrix) theory in spaces with boundaries

Comments: plain LaTeX, 15 pages, 1st revision

notes on originators of ideasA proposal for the matrix model formulation of the M-theory on a space with aboundary is given. A general machinery for modding out a symmetry in M(atrix)theory is used for a Z_2 symmetry changing the sign of the X_1 coordinate. Theconstruction causes the elements of matrices to be equivalent to real numbersor quaternions and the symmetry U(2N) of the original model is reduced to O(2N)or USp(2N)=U(N,H). We also show that membranes end on the boundary of thespacetime correctly in this construction.
