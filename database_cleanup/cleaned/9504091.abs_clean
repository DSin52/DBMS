We discuss the origin of the leg factors appearing in 2D string theory.Computing in the world sheet framework we use the semiclassical method to studystring amplitudes at high energy. We show that in the case of a simplest2-point amplitude these factors correspond entirely to the time delay forreflection off the Liouville wall. Our semiclassical calculation reveals thatthe string longitudinal modes, although nonpropagating in 2D spacetime, havethe effect of doubling the phase shift. Particular emphasis is put oncomparison with the point particle (center of mass) case. A general method isthen given for calculating an arbitrary amplitude semiclassically.
