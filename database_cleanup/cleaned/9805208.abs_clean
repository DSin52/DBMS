The near horizon geometry of four-dimensional black holes in the dilute gasregime is AdS_3 x S^2, and the global symmetry group is SU(2) x USp(6). This isexploited to calculate their perturbation spectrum using group theoreticalmethods. The result is interpreted in terms of three extreme M5-branes,orthogonally intersecting over a common string. We also consider N=8 blackholes in five dimensions, and compute the spectrum by explicit decoupling ofthe equations of motion, extending recent work on N=4 black holes. This resultis interpreted in terms of D1- and D5-branes that are wrapped on a smallfour-torus. The spectra are compared with string theory.
