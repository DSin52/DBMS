We propose a renormalization prescription for the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of(3+1)-dimensional Einstein gravity and also propose a strong coupling expansionas an approximation scheme to probe quantum geometry at length scales muchsmaller than the Planck length. We solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation to thesecond order in the expansion in a class of local solutions and discussproblems arising in our approach.
