The thermal Bogoliubov transformation in thermo field dynamics is generalizedin two respects. First, a generalization of the $\alpha$--degree of freedom totilde non--conserving representations is considered. Secondly, the usual$2\times2$ Bogoliubov matrix is extended to a $4\times4$ matrix includingmixing of modes with non--trivial multiparticle correlations. The analysis iscarried out for both bosons and fermions.
