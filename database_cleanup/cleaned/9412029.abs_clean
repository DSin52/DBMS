Contracting the $h$-deformation of $\SL(2,\Real)$, we construct a newdeformation of two dimensional Poincar\'e algebra, the algebra of functions onits group and its differential structure. It is also shown that the Hopfalgebra is triangular, and its universal R matrix is also constructedexplicitly. Then, we find a deformation map for the universal envelopingalgebra, and at the end, give the deformed mass shells and Lorentztransformation.
