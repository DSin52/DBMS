We study the cohomology of the Schwinger term arising in second quantizationof the class of observables belonging to the restricted general linear algebra.We prove that, for all pseudodifferential operators in 3+1 dimensions of thistype, the Schwinger term is equivalent to the ``twisted'' Radul cocycle, amodified version of the Radul cocycle arising in non-commutative differentialgeometry. In the process we also show how the ordinary Radul cocycle for anypair of pseudodifferential operators in any dimension can be written as thephase space integral of the star commutator of their symbols projected to theappropriate asymptotic component.
