A new 2-parameter quadratic deformation of the quantum oscillator algebra andits 1-parameter deformed Heisenberg subalgebra are considered. An infinitedimensional Fock module representation is presented which at roots of unitycontains null vectors and so is reducible to a finite dimensionalrepresentation. The cyclic, nilpotent and unitary representations arediscussed. Witten's deformation of $sl_2$ and some deformed infinitedimensional algebras are constructed from the $1d$ Heisenberg algebragenerators. The deformation of the centreless Virasoro algebra at roots ofunity is mentioned. Finally the $SL_q(2)$ symmetry of the deformed Heisenbergalgebra is explicitly constructed.
