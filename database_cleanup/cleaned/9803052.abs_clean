We obtain effective equations of inflationary dynamics for the mean inflatonand metric fields in the no-boundary and tunneling quantum states of theUniverse. In the slow roll approximation (taking the form of the localSchwiger-DeWitt expansion) effective equations follow from the Euclideaneffective action on the DeSitter gravitational instanton. Effective equationsare applied in the model of the inflaton scalar field coupled to the GUT sectorof matter fields and also having a strong nonminimal coupling to the curvature.The inverse of its big negative nonminimal coupling constant, serves as a smallparameter of the slow roll expansion and semiclassical expansion of quantumgravitational effects. As a source of initial conditions we use a sharpprobability peak recently obtained in the one-loop approximation for theno-boundary and tunneling quantum states and belonging (in virtue of a strongnonminimal coupling) to the GUT energy scale much below the Planck scale. Theobtained equations in the tunneling quantum state predict a finite duration ofinflationary stage compatible with the observational status of inflationtheory, whereas for the no-boundary state they lead to the infiniteinflationary epoch with a constant inflaton field.
