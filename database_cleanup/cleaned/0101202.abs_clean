We study essentially non-Abelian backgrounds in the five dimensional N=4gauged SU(2)$\times$U(1) supergravity. Static configurations that are invariantunder either the SO(4) spatial rotations or with respect to the SO(3) rotationsand translations along the fourth spatial coordinate are considered. Byanalyzing consistency conditions for the equations for supersymmetric Killingspinors we derive the Bogomol'nyi equations and obtain their globally regularsolutions. The SO(4) symmetric configurations contain the purely magneticnon-Abelian fields together with the purely electric Abelian field and possesstwo unbroken supersymmetries. The SO(3) configurations have only thenon-Abelian fields and preserve four supersymmetries.
