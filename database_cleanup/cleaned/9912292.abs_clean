Karpacz, Poland, September 21-25, 1999We construct the worldline superfield massive superparticle actions whichpreserve 1/4 portion of the underlying higher-dimensional supersymmetry. Weconsider the cases of N=4/N=1 and N=8/N=2 partial breaking. In the first casewe present the corresponding Green-Schwarz type target superspace action withone kappa supersymmetry. In the second case we find out two possibilities, oneof which is a direct generalization of the N=4/N=1 case, while another isessentially different.
