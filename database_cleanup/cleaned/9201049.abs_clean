Explicit construction of the light-cone gauge quantum theory of bosonicstrings in 1+1 spacetime dimensions reveals unexpected structures. One is theexistence of a gauge choice that gives a free action at the price ofpropagating ghosts and a nontrivial BRST charge. Fixing this gauge leaves aU(1) Kac-Moody algebra of residual symmetry, generated by a conformal tensor ofrank two and a conformal scalar. Another is that the BRST charge made fromthese currents is nilpotent when the action includes a linear dilatonbackground, independent of the particular value of the dilaton gradient.Spacetime Lorentz invariance in this theory is still elusive, however, becauseof the linear dilaton background and the nature of the gauge symmetries.
