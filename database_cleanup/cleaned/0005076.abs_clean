We find the phase and flavor symmetry breaking pattern of each N=1supersymmetric vacuum of SU(n_c) and USp(2 n_c) gauge theories, constructedfrom the exactly solvable N=2 theories by perturbing them with small adjointand generic bare hypermultiplet (quark) masses. In SU(n_c) theories with n_f\leq n_c the vacua are labelled by an integer r, in which the flavor U(n_f)symmetry is dynamically broken to U(r) \times U(n_f-r) in the limit ofvanishing bare hyperquark masses. In the r=1 vacua the dynamical symmetrybreaking is caused by the condensation of magnetic monopoles in the n_frepresentation. For general r, however, the monopoles in the {}_{n_f}C_rrepresentation, whose condensation could explain the flavor symmetry breakingbut would produce too-many Nambu--Goldstone multiplets, actually "break up"induce confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking. In USp(2n_c) theories withn_f \leq n_c + 1, the flavor SO(2n_f) symmetry is dynamically broken to U(n_f),but with no description in terms of a weakly coupled local field theory. Inboth SU(n_c) and USp(2 n_c) theories, with larger numbers of quark flavors,besides the vacua with these properties, there exist also vacua in freemagnetic phase, with unbroken global symmetry.
