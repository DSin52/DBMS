The dynamical symmetry breaking in a two-field model is studied bynumerically solving the coupled effective field equations. These aredissipative equations of motion that can exhibit strong chaotic dynamics. Bychoosing very general model parameters leading to symmetry breaking along oneof the field directions, the symmetry broken vacua make the role of transitorystrange attractors and the field trajectories in phase space are stronglychaotic. Chaos is quantified by means of the determination of the fractaldimension, which gives an invariant measure for chaotic behavior. Discussionsconcerning chaos and dissipation in the model and possible applications torelated problems are given.
