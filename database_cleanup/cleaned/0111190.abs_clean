A new topological conformal field theory in four Euclidean dimensions isconstructed from N=4 super Yang-Mills theory by twisting the whole of theconformal group with the whole of the R-symmetry group, resulting in a theorythat is conformally invariant and has two conformally invariant BRST operators.A curved space generalisation is found on any Riemannian 4-fold. Thisformulation has local Weyl invariance and two Weyl-invariant BRST symmetries,with an action and energy-momentum tensor that are BRST-exact. This theory isexpected to have a holographic dual in 5-dimensional de Sitter space.
