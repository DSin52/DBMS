We introduce an infrared regulator in Yang--Mills theories under the form ofa mass term for the nonabelian fields. We show that the resulting action, builtin a covariant linear gauge, is multiplicatively renormalizable by proving thevalidity at all orders of the Slavnov identity defining the theory.
