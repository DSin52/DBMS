We show how the two--matrix model and Toda lattice hierarchy presented in acorrelators of pure tachyonic states at every genus. We then extend the modelto incorporate a set of discrete states organized in finite dimensional $sl_2$representations. We solve also this extended model and find the correlators ofthe discrete states by means of the $W$ constraints and the flow equations. Ourresults coincide with the ones existing in the literature in those cases inwhich particular correlators have been explicitly calculated. We conclude thatthe extented two--matrix model is a realization of the discrete states of $c=1$string theory.
