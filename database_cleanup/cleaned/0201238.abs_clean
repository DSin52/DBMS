Title: Some Considerations Regarding Lorentz-Violating Theories

Authors: Ralf Lehnert

Comments: 10 pages, presented at the Second Meeting on CPT and Lorentz

Symmetry, Bloomington, Indiana, August 2001We investigate the compatibility of Lorentz-violating quantum field theorieswith the requirements of causality and stability. A general renormalizablemodel for free massive fermions indicates that these requirements are satisfiedat low energies provided the couplings controlling the breaking are small.However, for high energies either microcausality or energy positivity or bothare violated in some observer frame. We find evidence that this difficulty canbe avoided if the model is interpreted as a sub-Planckian approximationoriginating from a nonlocal theory with spontaneous Lorentz violation. Thepresent study thereby supports the validity of the standard-model extension asthe low-energy limit of any realistic string theory that exhibits spontaneousLorentz breaking.
