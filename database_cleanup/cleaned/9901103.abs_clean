The effects of extra space-time dimensions on the Wilsonian effectiveK\"ahler potential and the perturbative one loop effective K\"ahler potentialare determined within the framework of an Abelian gauge theory with N=2supersymmetric field content. The relation between the K\"ahler metric and theeffective gauge couplings which leads to the absence of radiative correctionsto the K\"ahler potential is expressed as a function of the radius ofcompactification of a fifth dimension. In general, the quantum corrections tothe low energy K\"ahler potential are shown to grow with this radius reflectingthe underlying higher dimensional nature of the theory.
