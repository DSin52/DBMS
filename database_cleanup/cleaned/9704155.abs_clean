Workshop ``Recent Developments in QCD and Hadron Physics'', 16-18 December,1996, Yukawa Institute, Kyoto, JapanThe general properties of the abelian projection are reviewed. We derive theexplicit expression for the abelian functional integral for U(1) abelian theorywhich corresponds to the abelian projection of the SU(2) gluodynamics. Thenumerical results for the temperature dependence of the monopole condensate arepresented.
