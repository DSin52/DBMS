We calculate in this article the transport coefficients which characterizethe dynamics of solitons in quantum field theory using the methods ofdissipative quantum systems. We show how the damping and diffusion coefficientsof soliton-like excitations can be calculated using the integral functionalformalism. The model obtained in this article has new features which cannot beobtained in the standard models of dissipation in quantum mechanics.
