Title: A relativistic superalgebra in a generalized Schroedinger picture

Authors: Rudolf A. Frick

Comments: 7 pages

We consider a relativistic superalgebra in the picture in which the time andspatial derivative cannot be presented in the operators of the particle. Thesupersymmetry generators as well as the Hamilton operators for the massiverelativistic particles with spin zero and spin-1/2 are expressed in terms ofthe principal series of the unitary representations of the Lorentz group. Wealso consider the massless case. New Hamilton operators are conctructed for themassless particles with spin zero and spin 1/2.
