A while ago, examples of N=1 vacua in D=6 were constructed as orientifolds ofType IIB string theory compactified on the K3 surface. Among the interestingfeatures of those models was the presence of D5-branes behaving like smallinstantons, and the appearance of extra tensor multiplets. These are bothnon-perturbative phenomena from the point of view of heterotic string theory.Although the orientifold models are a natural setting in which to study thesenon-perturbative Heterotic string phenomena, it is interesting and instructiveto explore how such vacua are realised in Heterotic string theory, M-theory andF-theory, and consider the relations between them. In particular, we considermodels of M-theory compactified on K3 x S^1/Z_2 with fivebranes present on theinterval. There is a family of such models which yields the same spectra as asubfamily of the orientifold models. By further compactifying on T^2 to fourdimensions we relate them to Heterotic string spectra. We then useHeterotic/Type IIA duality to deduce the existence of Calabi-Yau 3-folds whichshould yield the original six dimensional orientifold spectra if we use them tocompactify F-theory. Finally, we show in detail how to take a limit of such anF-theory compactification which returns us to the Type IIB orientifold models.
