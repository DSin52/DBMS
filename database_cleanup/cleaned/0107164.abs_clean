In the limit of small velocities, the dynamics of half-BPS Yang-Mills-Higgssolitons can be described by the geodesic approximation. Recently, it has beenshown that quarter-BPS states require the addition of a potential term to thisapproximation. We explain the logic behind this modification for a larger classof models and then analyse in detail the dynamics of two five-dimensionaldyonic instantons, using both analytical and numerical techniques.Nonzero-modes are shown to play a crucial role in the analysis of thesesystems, and we explain how these modes lead to qualitatively new types ofdynamics.
