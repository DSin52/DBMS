Title: Classical Duality in Gauge Theories

Comments: 7 pages, latex, no figures

A dual action is obtained for a general non-abelian and non-supersymmetricgauge theory at the classical level. The construction follows steps similar tothose used in pure abelian gauge theory. As an example we study thespontaneously broken SO(3) gauge theory and show that the electric and themagnetic fields get interchanged in the dual theory.
