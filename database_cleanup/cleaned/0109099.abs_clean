We construct a family of (p+3)-dimensional brane worlds in which the branehas one compact extra dimension, the bulk has two extra dimensions, and thebulk closes regularly at codimension two submanifolds known as bolts. The(p+1)-dimensional low energy spacetime M_{low} may be any Einstein space withan arbitrary cosmological constant, the value of the bulk cosmological constantis arbitrary, and the only fields are the metric and a bulk Maxwell field. Thebrane can be chosen to have positive tension, and the closure of the bulkprovides a singularity-free boundary condition for solutions that contain blackholes or gravitational waves in M_{low}. The spacetimes admit a nonlineargravitational wave whose properties suggest that the Newtonian gravitationalpotential on a flat M_{low} will behave essentially as the static potential ofa massless minimally coupled scalar field with Neumann boundary conditions.When M_{low} is (p+1)-dimensional Minkowski with p\ge3 and the bulkcosmological constant vanishes, this static scalar potential is shown to havethe long distance behaviour characteristic of p spatial dimensions.
