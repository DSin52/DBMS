The use of complex geometry allows us to obtain a consistent formulation ofoctonionic quantum mechanics (OQM). In our octonionic formulation we solve thehermiticity problem and define an appropriate momentum operator within OQM. Thenonextendability of the completeness relation and the norm conservation is alsodiscussed in details.
