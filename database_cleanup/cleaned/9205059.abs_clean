The open string with one-dimensional target space is formulated in terms ofan SOS, or loop gas, model on a random surface. We solve an integral equationfor the loop amplitude with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions imposedon different pieces of its boundary. The result is used to calculate the meanvalues of order and disorder operators, to construct the string propagator andfind its spectrum of excitations. The latter is not sensible neither to thestring tension $\L$ nor to the mass $\mu$ of the ``quarks'' at the ends of thestring. As in the case of closed strings, the SOS formulation allows toconstruct a Feynman diagram technique for the string interaction amplitudes.
