We present details of the harmonic space construction of a quaternionicextension of the four-dimensional Taub-NUT metric. As the main merit of theharmonic space approach, the metric is obtained in an explicit form following ageneric set of rules. It exhibits $SU(2)\times U(1)$ isometry group and dependson two parameters, Taub-NUT `mass' and the cosmological constant. We considerseveral limiting cases of interest which correspond to special choices of theinvolved parameters.
