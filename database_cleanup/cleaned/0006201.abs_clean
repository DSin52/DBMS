We investigate in the simplest compact D=4 N=1 Type IIB orientifold modelsthe sigma-model symmetry suggested by the proposed duality of these models toheterotic orbifold vacua. This symmetry is known to be present at the classicallevel, and is associated to a composite connection involving untwisted moduliin the low-energy supergravity theory. In order to study possible anomaliesarising at the quantum level, we compute potentially anomalous one-loopamplitudes involving gluons, gravitons and composite connections. We argue thatthe effective vertex operator associated to the composite connection has thesame form as that for a geometric deformation of the orbifold. Assuming this,we are able to compute the complete anomaly polynomial, and find that all theanomalies are canceled through a Green-Schwarz mechanism mediated by twisted RRaxions, as previously conjectured. Some questions about the field theoryinterpretation of our results remain open.
