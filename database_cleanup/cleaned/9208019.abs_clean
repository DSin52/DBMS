Title: 2D Quantum Gravity and The Miura Map

Comments: 12 pages, phyzzx

We study the sL(3,C) mKDV string theories. We obtain the flows and the stringequations. Using the generalized Miura map, we show that we have an unificationof these models with the [P,Q]=Q sL(3,C) KDV ones in the framework ofopen-closed string theories in minimal models backgrounds.
