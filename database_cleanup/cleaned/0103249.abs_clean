We confront Cardy's suggested c-function for four-dimensional field theorieswith the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetries in asymptotically freevectorlike gauge theories with fermions transforming according to differentrepresentations under the gauge group. Assuming that the infrared limit of thec-function is determined by the dimension of the associated Goldstone manifold,we find that this c-function always decreases between the ultraviolet andinfrared fixed points.
