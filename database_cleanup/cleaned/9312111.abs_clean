Title: K\"ahler manifolds with positive first Chern class and mirrors of rigid

Calabi-Yau manifoldsComments: 18 pages

Recent work on the relation between a special class of K\"ahler manifoldswith positive first Chern class and critical N$=$2 string vacua with c$=$9 isreviewed and extended. (Based on a talk presented at the International WorkshopSupersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions(SUSY 93), Boston, MA, March 1993)
