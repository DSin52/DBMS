We investigate Landau-Ginzburg string theory with the singular superpotentialX^{-1} on arbitrary Riemann surfaces. This theory, which is a topologicalversion of the c=1 string at the self-dual radius, is solved using results fromintersection theory and from the analysis of matter Landau-Ginzburg systems,and consistency requirements. Higher-genus amplitudes decompose as a sum ofcontributions from the bulk and the boundary of moduli space. These amplitudesgenerate the W-infinity algebra.
