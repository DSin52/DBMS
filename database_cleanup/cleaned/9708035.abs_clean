A BPHZ renormalized form for the master equation of the field antifiled (orBV) quantization has recently been proposed by De Jonghe, Paris and Troost.This framework was shown to be very powerful in calculating gauge anomalies. Weshow here that this equation can also be applied in order to calculate a globalanomaly (anomalous divergence of a classically conserved Noether current),considering the case of QED. This way, the fundamental result about theanomalous contribution to the Axial Ward identity in standard QED (where thereis no gauge anomaly) is reproduced in this BPHZ regularized BV framework.
