Authors: Juan Fernando Ospina Giraldo

Comments: 7 pages on Latex

The Wess-Zumino action for generalized orientifold planes (GOp-planes) ispresented and a series power expantion is realized from which processes thatinvolves GOp-planes, RR-forms, gravitons and gaugeons, are obtained. Finallynon-standard GOp-planes are showed.
