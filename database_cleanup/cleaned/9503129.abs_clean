We address the question whether so-called m-invariants of the N=2 superVirasoro algebra can be used for the construction of reasonablefour-dimensional string models. It turns out that an infinite subset of thoseare pathological in the sense that - although N=2 supersymmetric - the Ramondsector is not isomorphic to the Neveu-Schwarz sector. Consequently, these twoproperties are independent and only requiring both guarantees an N=1 space-timesupersymmetric string spectrum. However, the remaining 529 consistent spectra -210 of them are mirrors of Gepner models and 76 real orbifolds - show exactmirror symmetry and are contained in a recent classification of orbifolds ofGepner models.
