A quadratic semiclassical theory, regarding the interaction of gravity with amassive scalar quantum field, is considered in view of the renormalizableenergy-momentum tensor in a multi-dimensional curved spacetime. According toit, a self-consistent coupling between the square curvature term R^{2} and thequantum field \Phi should be introduced in order to yield the "correct"renormalizable energy-momentum tensor in quadratic gravity theories. Thesubsequent interaction discards any higher-order derivative terms from thegravitational field equations, but, in the expence, it introduces a geometricsource term in the wave equation for the quantum field. Unlike the conformalcoupling case (R\Phi ^{2}), this term does not represent an additional "mass"and, therefore, the quantum field interacts with gravity not only through itsmass (or energy) content (~\Phi ^{2}), but also, in a more generic way(R^{2}\Phi). Within this context, we propose a general method to obtainmode-solutions for the quantum field, by means of the associated Green'sfunction in an anisotropic six-dimensional background.
