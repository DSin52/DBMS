We extend the construction of the boundary states in Gepner models to thenon-diagonal modular invariant theories, and derive the same supersymmetricconditions as the diagonal theories. We also investigate the relation betweenthe microscopic charges of the boundary states and Ramond charges of the B-typeD-branes on the Calabi-Yau threefolds with one K\"ahler modulus in the largevolume limit.
