We study the thermodynamics of the large N noncommutative super Yang-Millstheory in the strong 't Hooft coupling limit in the spirit of AdS/CFTcorrespondence. It has already been noticed that some thermodynamic quantitiesof near-extremal D3-branes with NS B fields, which are dual gravityconfigurations of the noncommutative ${\cal N}$=4 super Yang-Mills theory, arethe same as those without B fields. In this paper, (1) we examine the$\alpha'^3 R^4$ corrections to the free energy and find that the part of thetree-level contribution remains unchanged, but the one-loop and thenon-perturbative D-instanton corrections are suppressed, compared to theordinary case. (2) We consider the thermodynamics of a bound state probeconsisting of D3-branes and D-strings in the near-extremal D3-brane backgroundwith B field, and find the thermodynamics of the probe is the same as that of aD3-brane probe in the D3-brane background without B field. (3) Thestress-energy tensor of the noncommutative super Yang-Mills theory iscalculated via the AdS/CFT correspondence. It is found that the tensor is notisotropic and its trace does not vanish, which confirms that the superYang-Mills is not conformal even in four dimensions due to the noncommutativenature of space. Our results render further evidence for the argument that thelarge N noncommutative and ordinary super Yang-Mills theories are equivalentnot only in the weak coupling limit, but also in the strong coupling limit.
