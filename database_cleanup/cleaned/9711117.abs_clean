We study configurations of a single $M$ fivebrane in the geometry ${\bf R}^7\times Q$ where $Q$ is the Taub-NUT space. Taking the IIA limit at each valueof their modulus, two possibilities of the IIA configuration are revealed. Oneconsists of a NS fivebrane and a D sixbrane while the other consists of a NSfivebrane, a D sixbrane and a D fourbrane. In the latter case the fourbrane isshown to be suspended by the fivebrane and the sixbrane. This appearance offourbrane can be interpreted in Type IIA picture as the result of the crossingof the fivebrane and the sixbrane
