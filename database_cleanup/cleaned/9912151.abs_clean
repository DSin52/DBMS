We study the F-terms in N=1 supersymmetric, d=4 gauge theories arising fromD(p+3)-branes wrapping supersymmetric p-cycles in a Calabi-Yau threefold. If pis even the spectrum and superpotential for a single brane are determined bypurely classical ($\alpha^\prime \to 0$) considerations. If p=3,superpotentials for massless modes are forbidden to all orders in$\alpha^\prime$ and may only be generated by open string instantons. For thislatter case we find that such instanton effects are generically present. Mirrorsymmetry relates even and odd p and thus perturbative and nonperturbativesuperpotentials; we provide a preliminary discussion of a class of examples ofsuch mirror pairs.
