We present conjectures for the space-time form and leading large N dependenceof extremal and near-extremal correlation functions in the \N=8 superconformalYang-Mills theory in d=3 as well as in the (0,2) superconformal theory in d=6,using their gravity duals with M-theory on $AdS_4\times \S^7$ and $AdS_7 \times\S^4$ respectively. As a key part of the conjectures, we argue that the bulkcouplings associated with extremal and near-extremal field configurations inthe corresponding $AdS_4$ and $AdS_7$ gauged supergravities vanish. Thevanishing of these couplings constitutes a generalization of the property ofconsistent truncation of the Kaluza-Klein modes.
