We study the $C_{n}$ and $BC_{n}$ Ruijsenaars-Schneider(RS) models withinteraction potential of trigonometric and rational types. The Lax pairs forthese models are constructed and the involutive Hamiltonians are also given.Taking nonrelativistic limit, we also obtain the Lax pairs for thecorresponding Calogero-Moser systems.
