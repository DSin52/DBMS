We explore spherically symmetric stationary solutions, generated by ``stars''with regular interiors, in purely massive gravity. We reexamine the claim thatthe resummation of non-linear effects can cure, in a domain near the source,the discontinuity exhibited by the linearized theory as the mass m of thegraviton tends to zero. First, we find analytical difficulties with this claim,which appears not to be robust under slight changes in the form of the massterm. Second, by numerically exploring the inward continuation of the class ofasymptotically flat solutions, we find that, when m is ``small'', they all endup in a singularity at a finite radius, well outside the source, instead ofjoining some conjectured ``continuous'' solution near the source. We reopen,however, the possibility of reconciling massive gravity with phenomenology byexhibiting a special class of solutions, with ``spontaneous symmetry breaking''features, which are close, near the source, to general relativistic solutionsand asymptote, for large radii, a de Sitter solution of curvature ~m^2.
