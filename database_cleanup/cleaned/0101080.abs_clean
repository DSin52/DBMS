At sufficiently low energy the dynamics of a string web is dominated by zeromodes involving rigid motion of the internal strings. The dimension of theassociated moduli space equals the maximal number of internal faces in the web.The generic web moduli space has boundaries and multiple branches, and for webswith three or more faces the geometry is curved. Webs can also be studied in alift to M-theory, where a string web is replaced by a membrane wrapped on aholomorphic curve in spacetime. In this case the moduli space is complexifiedand admits a Kaehler metric.
