We study quasi-finite representation of the $\Winf$ algebra recently proposedby Kac and Radul. When the central charge is integer, we show that they arerepresented by free fermions and bosonic ghosts. There are some nontrivialrepresentations with vanishing central charge. We discuss that they may bedescribed by large $N$ limit of topological models. We calculate their operatoralgebras explicitly.
