Title: Trapping of Nonabelian Gauge Fields on a Brane

Comments: 8 pages, LaTex 2e

We show that as in abelian gauge fields, nonabelian gauge fields are alsotrapped on a brane in the Randall-Sundrum model by applying a new mechanismbased on topological Higgs mechanism. It is pointed out that although almostmassless gauge fields are localized on the brane by the new mechanism, exactlymassless gauge fields are not localized. This fact does not yield any problemto abelian gauge fields, but may give some problem to nonabelian gauge fieldssince it is known that there is a discontinuity between massless and massivegauge fields in the case of nonabelian gauge groups.
