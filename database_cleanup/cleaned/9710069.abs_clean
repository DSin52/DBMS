A few generalizations of a Poisson algebra to field theory canonicallyformulated in terms of the polymomentum variables are discussed. A gradedPoisson bracket on differential forms and an $(n+1)$-ary bracket on functionsare considered. The Poisson bracket on differential forms gives rise to variousLoday) and the higher-order (in the sense of the higher order graded Leibnizrule). The $(n+1)$-ary bracket fulfills the properties of the Nambu bracketincluding the ``fundamental identity'', thus leading to the Nambu-Poissonalgebra. We point out that in the field theory context the Nambu bracket with aproperly defined covariant analogue of Hamilton's function determines a jointevolution of several dynamical variables.
