In the presence of Chern-Simons interactions the wave functionals of physicalstates in 2+1-dimensional gauge theories vanish at anumber of nodal points. Weshow that those nodes are located at some classical configurations which carrya non-trivial magnetic charge. In abelian gauge theories this fact explains whymagnetic monopoles are suppressed by Chern-Simons interactions. In non-abeliantheories it suggests a relevant role for nodal gauge field configurations inthe confinement mechanism of Yang-Mills theories. We show that the vacuum nodescorrespond to the chiral gauge orbits of reducible gauge fields withnon-trivial magnetic monopole components.
