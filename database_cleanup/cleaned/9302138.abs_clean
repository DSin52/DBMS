It is shown that the Lie algebra of the automorphic, meromorphic sl(2, C)infinite-dimensional finitely generated Lie algebra. In the trigonometriclimit, when the modular parameter of the torus goes to zero, the former Liealgebra goes over into the sl(2,C) -valued loop algebra, while the latter one -into the Lie algebra (sl(2)^)'/(centre) .
