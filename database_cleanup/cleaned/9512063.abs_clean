We study embeddings of the Prasad-Sommerfield monopole solution in SU(N)Super-QCD (N>2), where the role of the Higgs field is played by the squarks inthe fundamental representation. Classically, the resulting configurations livein a phase with unbroken SU(k) subgroups of SU(N) (as a result they are nottopologically stable). The structure of zero modes is such that they can benaturally interpreted as massive chiral superfields with R charge one andbaryon number zero, transforming in the adjoint representation of a dual gaugegroup defined using the Goddard-Nuyts-Olive (GNO) framework. We discuss thepossible applications of these monopoles to N=1 duality, and more generally thepossibility of relating GNO-type dual gauge groups to those appearing in N=1duality.
