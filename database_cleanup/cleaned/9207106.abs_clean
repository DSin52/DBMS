Title: The New Charged Massless States of Quantum Electrodynamics

Authors: E.C.Marino

Comments: 10 pages, Princeton report PUPT-1331

Quantum Electrodynamics can be formulated as the theory of an antisymmetrictensor gauge field. In this formulation the topological current of this fieldappears as an additional source for the electromagnetic field. The topologicalcharge therefore acts physically as an electric charge. The topologicallynontrivial, electrically charged sector contains massless quantum statesorthogonal to the vacuum in spite of the absence of classical topologicalsolutions. These states are created by a gauge invariant local operator and canbe interpreted as coherent states of photons. The obtainment of a quantity likecharge, which is usually associated with matter, as a property of some peculiarstates of the gauge field points towards the possibility of describing both thematter and the fields which mediate its interactions within the same unifiedframework.
