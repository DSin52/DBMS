It is shown that there exist large classes of BPS vacua in heterotic M-theorywhich have negative tension on the visible orbifold plane, positive tension onthe hidden plane and positive tension, physical five-branes in the bulk space.Explicit examples of such vacua are presented. Furthermore, it is demonstratedthat the ratio, beta/|alpha|, of the bulk five-brane tension to the visibleplane tension can, for several large classes of such vacua, be made arbitrarilysmall. Hence, it is straightforward to find vacua with the properties requiredin the examples of the Ekpyrotic theory of cosmology - a visible brane withnegative tension and beta/|alpha| small. This contradicts recent claims in theliterature.
