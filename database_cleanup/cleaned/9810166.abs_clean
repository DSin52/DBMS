We investigate the canonical structure of the (2+1)-dimensional non-linear$\sigma$ model in a $polynomial$ formulation. A current density defined in thenon-linear $\sigma$ model is a vector field which satisfies a $formal$ flatness(or pure gauge) condition. It is the polynomial formulation in which the vectorfield is regarded as a dynamical variable on which the flatness condition isimposed as a constraint condition by introducing a Lagrange multiplier field.The model so formulated has gauge symmetry under a transformation of theLagrange multiplier field. We construct the generalized Hamiltonian formalismof the model explicitly by using the Dirac method for constrained systems. Wesystem, the current algebra is realized as the fundamental Dirac Brackets. Thesecond one manifests the similar canonical structure as the Chern-Simons or BFtheories. In the last one, there appears an interesting interaction as thedynamical variables are coupled to their conjugate momenta via the covariantderivative.
