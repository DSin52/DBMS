Dyonic black holes with string-loop corrections are studied in thenear-horizon region. In perturbative heterotic string theory compactified tofour dimensions with N=2 supersymmetry, in the first order in string-loopexpansion parameter, we solve the system of Maxwell and Killing spinorequations for dyonic black hole. At the horizon, the string-loop-correctedsolution displays restoration of spontaneously broken supersymmetry.
