We develop two numerical methods to solve the differential equations withdeviating arguments for the motion of two charges in the action-at-a-distanceelectrodynamics. Our first method uses St\"urmer's extrapolation formula andassumes that a step of integration can be taken as a step of light ladder,which limits its use to shallow energies. The second method is an improvementof pre-existing iterative schemes, designed for stronger convergence and can beused at high-energies.
