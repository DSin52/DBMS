Title: A Topologically Stable Solution in Quantum Electrodynamics

Comments: 8 pages ( AMSTEX / AMSPPT )

This paper constructs exact classical solutions of the equations of QED.These are constructed in 4+2 dimensional space, which fibers over the usual 3+1dimensional space-time. The solution is stationary and localised about atopological singularity in space time. The electromagnetic field is that of apoint electric charge, positioned at the singularity. Away from thesingularity, all the conserved currents vanish. The solution comes in 8varieties, corresponding to any choice of positive or negative charge, spin ormass (though it is presumed that the negative mass solutions are not physical).The charge is quantised, and determined up to sign by the coupling constant inthe theory. The main element in the construction is simply the requirement thatthe solution be rotationally symmetric.
