Using the brick wall method we compute the statistical entropy of a scalarfield in a nontrivial background, in two different cases. These background aregenerated by four and five dimensional black holes with four and three U(1)charges respectively. The Bekenstein entropy formula is generally obeyed, butcorrections are discussed in the latter case.
