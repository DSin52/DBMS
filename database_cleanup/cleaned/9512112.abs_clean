Feynman rules for the vacuum amplitude of fermions coupled to external gaugeand Higgs fields in a domain wall lattice model are derived usingtime--dependent perturbation theory. They have a clear and simple structurecorresponding to 1--loop vacuum graphs. Their continuum approximations areextracted by isolating the infrared singularities and it is shown that, in eachorder, they reduce to vacuum contributions for chiral fermions. In this sensethe lattice model is seen to constitute a valid regularization of the continuumtheory of chiral fermions coupled to weak and slowly varying gauge and Higgsfields. The overlap amplitude, while not gauge invariant, exhibits a welldefined (modulo phase conventions) response to gauge transformations of thebackground fields. This response reduces in the continuum limit to the expectedchiral anomaly, independently of the phase conventions.
