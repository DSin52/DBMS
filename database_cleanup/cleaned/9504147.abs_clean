Some of the extremal black hole solutions in string theory have the samequantum numbers as the Bogomol'nyi saturated elementary string states. Weexplore the possibility that these black holes can be identified to elementarystring excitations. It is shown that stringy effects could correct theBekenstein-Hawking formula for the black hole entropy in such a way that itcorrectly reproduces the logarithm of the density of elementary string states.In particular, this entropy has the correct dependence on three independentparameters, the mass and the left-handed charge of the black hole, and thestring coupling constant.
