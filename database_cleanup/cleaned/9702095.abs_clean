The gauged SL(2,R)/U(1) Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) model isclassically an integrable conformal field theory. We have found a Lax pairrepresentation for the non-linear equations of motion, and a B"acklundtransformation. A second-order differential equation of the Gelfand-Dikii typedefines the Poisson bracket structure of the theory, and its fundamentalsolutions describe the general solution of the WZNW model as well. The physicaland free fields are related by non-local transformations. The (anti-)chiralcomponent of the energy-momentum tensor which factorizes into conservedquantities satisfying a non-linear algebra characteristic for parafermionsassumes the expected canonical free field form. So the black hole model seemsto be prepared for an exact canonical quantization.
