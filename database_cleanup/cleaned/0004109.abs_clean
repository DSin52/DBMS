We show that in brane-world scenarios with warped extra dimensions, theCasimir force due to bulk matter fields may be sufficient to stabilize theradion field $\phi$. In particular, we calculate one loop effective potentialfor $\phi$ induced by bulk gravitons and other possible massless bulk fields inthe Randall-Sundrum background. This potential has a local extremum, which canbe a maximum or a minimum depending on the detailed bulk matter content. If theparameters of the background are chosen so that the hierarchy problem is solvedgeometrically, then the radion mass induced by Casimir corrections ishierarchycally smaller than the $TeV$. Hence, in this important case, we mustinvoke an alternative mechanism (classical or nonperturbative) which gives theradion a sizable mass, to make it compatible with observations.
