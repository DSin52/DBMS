Using the methods of the 'form factor program' exact expressions of allmatrix elements are obtained for several operators of the quantum sine-Gordonmodel alias the massive Thirring model. A general formula is presented whichprovides form factors in terms of an integral representation. In particularcharge-less operators as for example the current of the topological charge, theenergy momentum tensor and all higher currents are considered. In the breathersector it is found the quantum sine-Gordon field equation holds with an exactrelation between the 'bare' mass and the normalized mass. Also a relation forthe trace of the energy momentum is obtained. All results are compared withFeynman graph expansion and full agreement is found.
