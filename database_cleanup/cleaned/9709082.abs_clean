Using twistor methods we derive a generating function which leads to thehyperk\" ahler metric on a deformation of the Atiyah-Hitchin monopole modulispace. This deformation was first considered by Dancer through the quotientconstruction and is related to a charge two monopole configuration in acompletely broken SU(3) gauge theory. The manifold and metric are the firstmembers of a family of hyperk\" ahler manifolds which are deformations of the$D_k$ rational singularities of $C^2$.
