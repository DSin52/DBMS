In order to investigate dynamical symmetry breaking, we studyNambu$\cdot$Jona-Lasinio model in the large-N limit in the stochasticquantization method. Here in order to solve Langevin equation, we imposespecified initial conditions and construct ``effective Langevin equation'' inthe large-N limit and give the same non-perturbative results as path-integralapproach gives. Moreover we discuss stability of vacuum by means of ``effectivepotential''.
