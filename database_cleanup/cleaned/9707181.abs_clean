We explore the relationship between black holes in Jackiw-Teitelboim(JT)dilaton gravity and solitons in sine-Gordon field theory. Our analysis expandson the well known connection between solutions of the sine-Gordon equation andconstant curvature metrics. In particular, we show that solutions to thedilaton field equations for a given metric in JT theory also solve thesine-Gordon equation linearized about the corresponding soliton. Since thedilaton generates Killing vectors of the constant curvature metric, it isinteresting that it has an analoguous interpretation in terms of symmetries ofthe soliton solution. We also show that from the B${\ddot a}$cklundtransformations relating different soliton solutions, it is possible toconstruct a flat SL(2,R) connection which forms the basis for the gauge theoryformulation of JT dilaton gravity.
