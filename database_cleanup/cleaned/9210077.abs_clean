The sine-Gordon equation is considered in the hamiltonian framework providedby the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem. The phase space, a finite dimensionalcoadjoint orbit in the dual space $\grg^*$ of a loop algebra $\grg$, isparametrized by a finite dimensional symplectic vector space $W$ embedded into$\grg^*$ by a moment map. Real quasiperiodic solutions are computed in terms oftheta functions using a Liouville generating function which generates acanonical transformation to linear coordinates on the Jacobi variety of asuitable hyperelliptic curve.
