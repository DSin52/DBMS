Title: Fock Vacuum Instability and Causality

Authors: Andreas Aste

Comments: LaTeX, 8 pages

The vacuum diagram is calculated at second order for theories withself-interacting massless fields in the framework of finite causal perturbationtheory. It is pointed out that the infrared behaviour of the vacuum diagramleads to unstable Fock vacua for QCD or massless QED, but not for quantumgravity. Therefore a radical rearrangement of the physical system must takeplace for such theories. Conversely, stability of the Fock vacuum for masslessinteracting fields is another hint at the possibility that quantum gravityshould be treated as an effective theory.
