We present a simple renormalizable abelian gauge model which includesantisymmetric second-rank tensor fields as matter fields rather than gaugefields known for a long time. The free action is conformally rather than gaugeinvariant. The quantization of the free fields is analyzed and the one-looprenormalization-group functions are evaluated. Transverse free waves are foundto convey no energy. The coupling constant of the axial-vector abelian gaugeinteraction exhibits asymptotically free ultraviolet behavior, while theself-couplings of the tensor fields do not asymptotically diminish.
