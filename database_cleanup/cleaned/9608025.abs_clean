It is interesting to superimpose the Pauli-Villars regularization on thelattice regularization. We illustrate how this scheme works by evaluating theaxial anomaly in a simple lattice fermion model, the Pauli-Villars Lagrangianwith a gauge non-invariant Wilson term. The gauge non-invariance of the axialanomaly, caused by the Wilson term, is remedied by a compensation amongPauli-Villars regulators in the continuum limit. A subtlety in Frolov-Slavnov'sscheme for an odd number of chiral fermions in an anomaly free complex gaugerepresentation, which requires an infinite number of regulators, is brieflymentioned.
