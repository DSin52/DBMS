Title: Relativistic Particle with Torsion and Charged Particle in a Constant

Comments: LATEX, 7 pages. Introductory part on the physical motivation and new

references are added. The revised version stresses the importance of theobserved duality for understanding noncorrelated behaviour of the signs ofsquared velocity and energy-momentum vectors in the particle and stringsystems with higher derivativesJournal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A10 (1995) 1463-1469

The identity of classical motion is established for two physically differentmodels, one of which is the relativistic particle with torsion, whose actioncontains higher derivatives and which is the effective system for thestatistically charged particle interacting with the Chern-Simons U(1) gaugefield, and another is the (2+1)-dimensional relativistic charged particle inexternal constant electromagnetic field.
