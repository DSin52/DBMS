We describe in superspace a classical theory of two dimensional $(1,1)$cosmological dilaton supergravity coupled to a massive superparticle. We givean exact non-trivial superspace solution for the compensator superfield thatdescribes the supergravity, and then use this solution to construct a model ofa two-dimensional supersymmetric black hole.
