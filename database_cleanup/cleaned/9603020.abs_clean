Charge and magnetic flux bearing operators are introduced in Chern-Simonstheory both in its pure form and when it is coupled to fermions. The magneticflux creation operator turns out to be the Wilson line. The euclideancorrelation functions of these operators are shown to be local and areevaluated exactly in the pure case and through an expansion in the inversefermion mass whenever these are present. Physical states only occur in thepresence of fermions and consist of composite charge-magnetic flux carryingstates which are in general anyonic. The large distance behavior of thecorrelation functions indicates the condensation of charge and magnetic flux.
