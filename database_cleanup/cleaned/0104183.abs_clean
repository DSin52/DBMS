We formulate the Chern-Simons action for any compact Lie group using Delignecohomology. This action is defined as a certain function on the space of smoothmaps from the underlying 3-manifold to the classifying space for principalbundles. If the 3-manifold is closed, the action is a function with values incomplex numbers. If the 3-manifold is not closed, then the action is a sectionof a Hermitian line bundle associated with the Riemann surface which appears asthe boundary.
