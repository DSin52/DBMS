A geometric generalization of first-order Lagrangian formalism is used toanalyse a conformal field theory for an arbitrary primary field. We requirethat global conformal transformations are Noetherian symmetries and we provethat the action functional can be taken strictly invariant with respect tothese transformations. In other words, there does not exists a "Chern-Simons"type Lagrangian for a conformally invariant Lagrangian theory.
