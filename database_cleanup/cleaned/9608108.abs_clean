Recently Das and Mathur found that the leading order Hawking emission rate ofneutral scalars by near-extremal $D=5$ black holes is exactly reproduced by astring theoretic model involving intersecting D-branes. We show that theagreement continues to hold for charged scalar emission. We further show thatsimilar agreement can be obtained for a class of near-extremal $D=4$ blackholes using a model inspired by M-theory. In this model, BPS saturated $D=4$black holes with four charges are realized in M-theory as 5-branes triplyintersecting over a string. The low-energy excitations are signals traveling onthe intersection string.
