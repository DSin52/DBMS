We discuss several closely related concepts in the NSR formulation ofsuperstring theory. We demonstrated that recently proposed NSR model forsuperstrings on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ is described by the world-sheet logarithmicconformal field theory (LCFT). The origin of LCFT on a world-sheet is closelyconnected to the matter-ghost mixing in the structure of a brane-like vortexoperators. We suggest a dynamical origin of M theory as a string theory with anextra dimension given by bosonised superconformal ghosts.
