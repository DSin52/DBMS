Title: Pursuing Gravitational S-Duality

Comments: Invited paper to appear in the special issue of the `Journal of

Naschie and C. Castro, editors), 19 pages, LaTeX file, no figuresRecently a strong-weak coupling duality in non-abelian non-supersymmetrictheories in four dimensions has been found. An analogous procedure is reviewed,which allows to find the `dual action' to the gauge theory of dynamical gravityconstructed by the MacDowell-Mansouri model plus the superposition of a$\Theta$ term.
