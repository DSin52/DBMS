The simple method for the calculating of the anomalous dimensions of thecomposite operators up to 1/N^2 order is developed. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of this approach by computing the critical exponents of the$(\otimes\vec\Phi)^{s}$ and $\vec\Phi\otimes(\otimes\vec\partial)^{n}\vec\Phi$operators in the 1/N^2 order in the nonlinear sigma model. The specialsimplifications due to the conformal invariance of the model are discussed.
