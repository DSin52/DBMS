A (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theory with a degenerate vacuum (ininfinite volume) can contain particles, known as kinks, which interpolatebetween different vacua and have nontrivial restrictions on theirmulti-particle Hilbert space. Assuming such a theory to be integrable, we showhow to calculate the multi-kink energy levels in finite volume given itsfactorizable $S$-matrix. In massive theories this can be done exactly up tocontributions due to off-shell and tunneling effects that fall offexponentially with volume. As a first application we compare our analyticalpredictions for the kink scattering theories conjectured to describe thesubleading thermal and magnetic perturbations of the tricritical Ising modelwith numerical results from the truncated conformal space approach. Inparticular, for the subleading magnetic perturbation our results allow us todecide between the two different $S$-matrices proposed by Smirnov andZamolodchikov.
