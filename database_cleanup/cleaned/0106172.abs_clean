Title: New duality transformation in two-dimensional non-linear sigma models

Authors: N. Mohammedi (University of Tours, France)

Comments: 10 pages, Major changes. The duality transformations are cast in a

simple formA new T-duality transformation is found in two-dimensional non-linear sigmamodels. This is a straightforward generalisation of Abelian and non-AbelianT-dualities.
