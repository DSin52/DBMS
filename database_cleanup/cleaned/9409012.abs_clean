Title: Introduction to Quantum Algebras

Comments: 25 pages

The concept of a quantum algebra is made easy through the investigation ofthe prototype algebras $u_{qp}(2)$, $su_q(2)$ and $u_{qp}(1,1)$. The latterquantum algebras are introduced as deformations of the corresponding Liealgebras~; this is achieved in a simple way by means of $qp$-bosons. The Hopfalgebraic structure of $u_{qp}(2)$ is also discussed. The basic ingredients forthe representation theory of $u_{qp}(2)$ are given. Finally, in connection withthe quantum algebra $u_{qp}(2)$, we discuss the $qp$-analogues of the harmonicoscillator and of the (spherical and hyperbolical) angular momenta.
