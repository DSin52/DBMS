Nonlocal regularization of QED is shown to possess an axial anomaly of thesame form as other regularization schemes. The Noether current is explicitlyconstructed and the symmetries are shown to be violated, whereas the identitiesconstructed when one properly considers the contribution from the path integralmeasure are respected. We also discuss the barrier to quantizing the fullygauged chiral invariant theory, and consequences.
