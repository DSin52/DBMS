Title: Frenet-Serret vacuum radiation, detection proposals and related topics

Comments: 28 pages, 1 eps figure, extended preliminary version of invited talk

at Quantum Aspects of Beam Physics 3, Higashi Hiroshima, Japan, January 7-11,2003The paradigmatic Unruh radiation is an ideal and simple case of stationaryvacuum radiation patterns related to worldlines defined as Frenet-Serretcurves. We review the corresponding body of literature as well as theexperimental proposals that have been suggested to detect these types ofquantum field radiation patterns. Finally, we comment on a few other topicsrelated to the Unruh effect
