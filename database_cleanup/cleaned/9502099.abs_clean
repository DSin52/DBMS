Static, four-dimensional (4-d) black holes (BH's) in ($4+n$)-d Kaluza-Klein(KK) theory with Abelian isometry and diagonal internal metric have at most oneelectric ($Q$) and one magnetic ($P$) charges, which can either come from thesame $U(1)$-gauge field (corresponding to BH's in effective 5-d KK theory) orfrom different ones (corresponding to BH's with $U(1)_M\times U(1)_E$ isometryof an effective 6-d KK theory). In the latter case, explicit non-extremesolutions have the global space-time of Schwarzschild BH's, finite temperature,and non-zero entropy. In the extreme (supersymmetric) limit the singularitybecomes null, the temperature saturates the upper bound$T_H=1/4\pi\sqrt{|QP|}$, and entropy is zero. A class of KK BH's withconstrained charge configurations, exhibiting a continuous electric-magneticduality, are generated by global $SO(n)$ transformations on the above classesof the solutions.
