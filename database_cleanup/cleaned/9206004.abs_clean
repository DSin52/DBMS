We investigate the possibility of false vacuum decay in $N=1$ supergravitytheories. By establishing a Bogomol'nyi bound for the energy density stored inthe domain wall of the $O(4)$ invariant bubble, we show that supersymmetricvacua remain absolutely stable against false vacuum decay into anothersupersymmetric vacuum. This conforms with and completes the previousperturbative analysis of Weinberg. Implications for dynamical supersymmetrybreaking and decompactification instabilities in superstring theory arediscussed. In addition, we show that there are no compact static sphericaldomain walls.
