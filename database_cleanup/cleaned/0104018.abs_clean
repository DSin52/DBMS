Presented are the integral solutions to the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikovequations for the correlation functions of both the bulk and boundary XXZmodels in the anti-ferromagnetic regime. The difference equations can bederived from Smirnov-type master equations for correlation functions on thebasis of the CTM bootstrap. Our integral solutions with an appropriate choiceof the integral kernel reproduce the formulae previously obtained by using thebosonization of the vertex operators of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{sl}_2})$.
