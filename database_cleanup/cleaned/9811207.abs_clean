We find the dyonic worldvolume solitons due to parallel (p,q) strings endingon a D-3-brane. These solutions preserve 1/4 of bulk supersymmetry. Then weinvestigate the scattering of well-separated dyons and find that their modulispace is a toric hyper-K\"ahler manifold. In addition, we present theworldvolume solitons of the D-3-brane which are related by duality to theM-theory configuration of two orthogonal membranes ending on a M-5-brane. Weshow that these solitons preserve 1/8 of supersymmetry and compute theireffective action.
