Using the factorization approach of Gepner and Qiu, I systematically rederivethe closed fractional superstring partition functions for K= 4, 8, and 16. Forthese theories the relationship between the massless graviton and gravi- tinosector and the purely massive sectors is explored. Properties of the massivesectors are investigated. A twist current in these models is found responsiblefor the occurrence of N=1 space-time supersymmetry. I show this twist currenttransforms bosonic (fermionic) projection states into fermionic (bosonic)non-projection states and vice-versa.
