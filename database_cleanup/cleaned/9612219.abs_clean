Title: Higher Topologies in 2+1-Gravity

I.N.F.N., Sezione di Firenze, Italy)Comments: Latex2e, 7 pages

I argue that the first-order formalism recently found to describe classical2+1-Gravity with matter, is also able to include higher topologies. The presentgauge, which is conformal with vanishing York time, is characterized by ananalytic mapping from single-valued coordinates to Minkowskian ones. In thetorus case, this mapping is based on four square-root branch points, whoselocation is related to the modulus, which has a well defined time dependence.In the general case, it is connected with the hyperelliptic representation ofRiemann surfaces.
