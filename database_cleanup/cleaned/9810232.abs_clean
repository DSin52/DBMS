Florence, ItalyFollowing Feynman's treatment of the non-relativistic polaron problem,integrating out the bosonic degrees of freedom the resulting effective actionis formulated in terms of particle trajectories (worldlines) instead of fieldoperators. The Green functions of the theory are then approximatedvariationally on the pole of the external particles by using a retardedquadratic trial action. Application to a scalar theory gives non-perturbative,covariant results for vertex functions and scattering processes. Recentprogress in dealing with the spin degrees of freedom in fermionic systems, inparticular Quantum Electrodynamics, is discussed. We evaluate the averagesneeded in the Feynman variational principle for a general quadratic trialaction and study the structure of the dressed fermion propagator.
