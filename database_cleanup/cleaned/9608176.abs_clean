We evaluate the chiral condensate and Polyakov loop in two-dimensional QEDwith a fermion of an arbitrary mass ($m$). We find discontinuous $m$ dependencein the chiral condensate and anomalous temperature dependence in Polyakov loopswhen the vacuum angle $\theta$$\sim$$\pi$ and $m$=O($e$). These nonperturbativephenomena are due to the bifurcation process in the solutions to the vacuumeigenvalue equation.
