We show that the $Y_{ab}^c$ of Pradisi-Sagnotti-Stanev are indeed integers,and we prove a conjecture of Borisov-Halpern-Schweigert. We indicate some ofthe special features which arise when the order of the modular matrix T is odd.Our arguments are general, applying to arbitrary ``parent'' RCFT assuming onlythat T has odd order.
