We give several pieces of evidence to show that extremal black holes cannotbe obtained as limits of non-extremal black holes. We review arguments in theliterature showing that the entropy of extremal black holes is zero, while thatof near-extremal ones obey the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. However, from thecounting of degeneracy of quantum (BPS) states of string theory the entropy ofextremal stringy black holes obeys the area law. An attempt is made toreconcile these arguments.
