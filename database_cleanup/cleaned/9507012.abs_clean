String-string duality dictates that type IIA strings compactified on a K3surface acquire non-abelian gauge groups for certain values of the K3 moduli.We argue that, contrary to expectation, the theories for which such enhancedgauge symmetries appear are not orbifolds in the string sense. For a specificexample we show that a theory with enhanced gauge symmetry and an orbifoldtheory have the same classical K3 surface as a target space but the value ofthe ``B-field'' differs. This raises the possibility that the conformal fieldtheory associated to a string theory with an enhanced gauge group is badlybehaved in some way.
