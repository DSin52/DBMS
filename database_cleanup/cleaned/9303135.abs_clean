We clarify the relation between 2-form Einstein gravity and its topologicalversion. The physical space of the topological version is contained in that ofthe Einstein gravity.Moreover a new vector field is introduced into 2-form Einstein gravity torestore the large symmetry of its topological version. The wave function of theuniverse is obtained for each model. (Talk given at the Workshop on GeneralRelativity and Gravitation held at Waseda University, January 18-20, 1993.)
