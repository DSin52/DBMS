We show from first principles, using explicitly invariant Pauli-Villarsregularization of chiral fermions, that the Nieh-Yan form does contribute tothe Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly for spacetimes with generic torsion, andcomment on some of the implications. There are a number of interesting andimportant differences with the usual ABJ contributions in the absence oftorsion. For dimensional reasons, the Nieh-Yan contribution is proportional tothe square of the regulator mass. In spacetimes with flat vierbein butnon-trivial torsion, the associated diagrams are actually vacuum polarizationrather than triangle diagrams, and the Nieh-Yan contribution to the ABJ anomalyarises from the fact that the axial torsion "photon" is not transverse.
