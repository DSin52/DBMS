Title: Homologically Twisted Invariants Related to (2+1)- and (3+1)-Dimensional

State-Sum Topological Quantum Field TheoriesComments: 6 pages

Motivated by suggestions of Paolo Cotta-Ramusino's work at the physical levelof rigor relating BF theory to the Donaldson polynomials, we provide aconstruction applicable to the Turaev/Viro and Crane/Yetter invariants of *apriori* finer invariants dependent on a choice of (co)homology class on themanifold
