Title: Adiabatic Vacua and Hadamard States for Scalar Quantum Fields on Curved

SpacetimeComments: 72 pages, Latex, 2 figures appended as uuencoded file

Quasifree states of a linear Klein-Gordon quantum field on globallyhyperbolic spacetime manifolds are considered. Using techniques from the theoryof pseudodifferential operators and wavefront sets on manifolds a criterion fora state to be an Hadamard state is developed. It is shown that ground- andKMS-states on certain static spacetimes and adiabatic vacuum states onRobertson-Walker spaces are Hadamard states. Finally, the problem ofconstructing Hadamard states on arbitrary curved spacetimes is solved inprinciple.
