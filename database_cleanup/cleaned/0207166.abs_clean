We find non-BPS solutions of the noncommutative CP^1 model in 2+1 dimensions.These solutions correspond to soliton anti-soliton configurations. We show thatthe one-soliton one-anti-soliton solution is unstable when the distance betweenthe soliton and the anti-soliton is small. We also construct time-dependentsolutions and other types of solutions.
