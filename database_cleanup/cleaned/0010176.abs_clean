Within a self-consistent framework of q-deformed Heisenberg algebra and itsequivalent framework of q-deformed boson commutation relations, which relate tothe under-cutting phenomenon of Heisenberg's minimal uncertainty relation,special q-deformed squeezed states are constructed. Besides the similar localmaximum squeezing as the one in the undeformed case, new strong squeezingappears when the amplitude of the related coherent state increases to largevariance of one component of the quadrature of the light field approaches zero,but the variance of the corresponding conjugate quantity remains finite, whichis a surprising deviation from Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. Thequalitative character exposed by this q-squeezed state may provide someevidence about q-deformed effects in current experiments.
