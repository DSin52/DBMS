In any string theory there is a hidden, twisted superconformal symmetryalgebra, part of which is made up by the BRST current and the anti-ghost. Weinvestigate how this algebra can be systematically constructed for strings with$N\!-\!2$ supersymmetries, via quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the Liesuperalgebras $osp(N|2)$. The motivation is to understand how one couldsystematically construct generalized string theories from superalgebras. Wealso briefly discuss the BRST algebra of the topological string, which is adoubly twisted $N\!=\!4$ superconformal algebra.
