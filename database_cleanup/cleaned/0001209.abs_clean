We provide the cosmological solutions for Randall-Sundrum models with thebulk energy-momentum $\hat T^5_5$ incorporated. It alters the Friedmannequation for the brane scale factor. We make a specific choice of $\hat T^5_5$which is adjusted to stabilize the extra dimension. This makes it possible tocompactify the extra dimension with a single positive tension brane, and thismodel provides a RS-type solution to the cosmological constant problem. Whenthe same idea is applied to the RS model with two branes, the wrong sign ofFriedmann equation for the negative tension brane can be resolved and usual FRWcosmology is reproduced for the brane.
