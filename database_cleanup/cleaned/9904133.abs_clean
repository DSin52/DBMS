By quantizing an open string ending on a D-brane in a nontrivial supergravitybackground, we argue that there is a new kind of uncertainty relation on aD-brane worldvolume. Furthermore, we fix the form of the uncertainty relationsand their dependence on the string coupling constant by requiring them to beconsistent with various string theory and M theory dualities. In this way wefind a web of uncertainties of spacetime for all kinds of brane probes,including fundamental strings, D-branes of all dimensions as well as M theorymembranes and fivebranes.
