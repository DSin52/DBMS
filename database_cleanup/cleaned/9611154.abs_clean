Title: Bosonized Formulation of Lattice QCD

Comments: 6 pages, latex, no figures Talk, presented at XYIII International

Seminar "Relativistic nuclear physics and Quantum Chromodynamics", Dubna,September 1996Problems in lattice gauge models with fermions are discussed. A new bosonicHermitean effective action for lattice QCD with dynamical quarks is presented.In distinction of the previous version, it does not include constraints and isbetter suited for Monte-Carlo simulations.
