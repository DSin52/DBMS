Title: Algebraic integrability of Schr\"odinger operators and representations

of Lie algebrasComments: 19 pages

In this paper we study integrability and algebraic integrability propertiesof certain matrix Schr\"odinger operators. More specifically, we associate suchan operator (with rational, trigonometric, or elliptic coefficients) to everysimple Lie algebra g and every representation U of this algebra with a nonzerobut finite dimensional zero weight subspace. The Calogero-Sutherland operatoris a special case of this construction. Such an operator is always integrable.Our main result is that it is also algebraically integrable in the rational andtrigonometric case if the representation U is highest weight. This generalizesthe corresponding result for Calogero-Sutherland operators proved by Chalyh andVaselov. We also conjecture that this is true for the elliptic case as well,which is a generalization of the corresponding conjecture by Chalyh and Vaselovfor Calogero-Sutherland operators.
