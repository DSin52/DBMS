Title: T-Duality and Non-Local Realizations of Supersymmetry in String Theory

Comments: 6 pages, Latex, Talk presented at the Workshop on Strings, Gravity

and Related Topics, Trieste, 29-30 June 1995We study non-local realizations of extended worldsheet supersymmetries andthe associated space-time supersymmetries which arise under a T-dualitytransformation. These non-local effects appear when the supersymmetries do notcommute with the isometry with respect to which T-duality is performed.
