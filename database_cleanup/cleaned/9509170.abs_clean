A Lagrangian definition of a large family of (0,2) supersymmetric conformalfield theories may be made by an appropriate gauge invariant combination of agauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model, right-moving supersymmetry fermions, andleft-moving current algebra fermions. Throughout this paper, use is made of theinterplay between field theoretic and algebraic techniques (together withsupersymmetry) which is facilitated by such a definition. These heterotic cosetmodels are thus studied in some detail, with particular attention paid to the(0,2) analogue of the N=2 minimal models, which coincide with the `monopole'theory of Giddings, Polchinski and Strominger. A family of modular invariantpartition functions for these (0,2) minimal models is presented. Some examplesof N=1 supersymmetric four dimensional string theories with gauge groups E_6 XG and SO(10) X G are presented, using these minimal models as building blocks.The factor G represents various enhanced symmetry groups made up of products ofSU(2) and U(1).
