All fiber bundle with a given set of characteristic classes are viewable asparticular projections of a more general bundle called a universal classifyingspace. This notion of projector valued field, a global definition ofconnections and gauge fields, can be useful to define vector bundles for noncommutative base spaces. In this paper we derive the projector valued field forthe fuzzy sphere, defining non-commutative n-monopole configurations, and checkthat in the classical limit, using the machinery of non-commutative geometry,the corresponding topological charges (Chern class) are integers.
