incorporated; minor spelling corrections and some discussion, and relatedreferences, were added in connection with the role of magnetic monopoles in4d compact abelian gauge theories. Talk to be given at the InternationalWorkshop of the `Hellenic Society for the Study of High Energy Physics',Democritos NRC, Athens, April 8-11, 1998In this talk I give a preliminary account of original results, obtained incollaboration with John Ellis. Details and further elaboration will bepresented in a forthcoming publication. We present a proposal for anon-critical (Liouville) string approach to confinement of four-dimensional(non-abelian) gauge theories, based on recent developments on the subject byWitten and Maldacena. We discuss the effects of vortices and monopoles on theopen world-sheets whose boundaries are Wilson loops of the target-space (nonAbelian) Gauge theory. By appropriately employing `D-particles', associatedwith the target-space embedding of such defects, we argue that the apprearanceof five-dimensional Anti-De-Sitter (AdS) space times is quite natural, as aresult of Liouville dressing.We isolate the world-sheet defect contributions tothe Wilson loop by constructing an appropriate observable, which is the same asthe second observable in the supersymmetric U(1) theory of Awada and Mansouri,but in our approach supersymmetry is not necessary.When vortex condensationoccurs, we argue in favour of a (low-temperature) confining phase, in the senseof an area law, for a large-$N_c$ (conformal) gauge theory at finitetemperatures. A connection of the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)transitions on the world-sheet with the critical temperatures in thethermodynamics of Black Holes in the five-dimensional AdS space is made.
