We consider N-point deformation of algebraic K3 surfaces. First, we constructtwo-point deformation of algebraic K3 surfaces by considering algebraicdeformation of a pair of commutative algebraic K3 surfaces. In this case, themoduli space of the noncommutative deformations is of dimension 19, the same asthe moduli dimension of the complex deformations of commutative algebraic K3surfaces. Then, we extend this method to the N-point case. In the N-point case,the dimension of deformation moduli space becomes 19N(N-1)/2.
