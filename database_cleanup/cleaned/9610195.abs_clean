We consider splitting type phase transitions between Calabi-Yau fourfolds.These transitions generalize previously known types of conifold transitionsbetween threefolds. Similar to conifold configurations the singular varietiesmediating the transitions between fourfolds connect moduli spaces of differentdimensions, describing ground states in M- and F-theory with different numbersof massless modes as well as different numbers of cycles to wrap variousp-branes around. The web of Calabi-Yau fourfolds obtained in this way containsthe class of all complete intersection manifolds embedded in products ofordinary projective spaces, but extends also to weighted configurations. Itfollows from this that for some of the fourfold transitions vacua withvanishing superpotential are connected to ground states with nonzerosuperpotential.
