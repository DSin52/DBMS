The Hamiltonian describing Matrix theory on T^n is identified with theHamiltonian describing the dynamics of D0-branes on T^n in an appropriate weakcoupling limit for all n up to 5. New subtleties arise in taking this weakcoupling limit for n=6, since the transverse size of the D0 brane system blowsup in this limit. This can be attributed to the appearance of extra lightstates in the theory from wrapped D6 branes. This subtlety is related to thedifficulty in finding a Matrix formulation of M-theory on T^6.
