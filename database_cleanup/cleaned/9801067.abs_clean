We study the BPS spectrum of supersymmetric 5 dimensional field theories andtheir representations as string webs. It is found that a state of given chargesexists when it has a representation as an irreducible string web. Its spin isdetermined by the string web. The number of fermionic zero modes is 8g+4b,where g is the number of internal faces and b is the number of boundaries. Inthe lift to M theory of 4d field theories such states are described bymembranes ending on the 5-brane, breaking SUSY from 8 to 4, and g becomes thegenus of the membrane. Mathematically, we obtain a diagrammatic method to findthe spectrum of curves on a toric complex surface, and the number of theirmoduli.
