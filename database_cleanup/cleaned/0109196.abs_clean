We formulate a linear difference equation which yields averagedsemi-inclusive decay rates for arbitrary, not necessarily large, values of themasses. We show that the rates for decays $M \to m+\M'$ of typical heavy openstrings are independent of the masses $M$ and $m$, and compute the ``massdeffect''$M-m-M'$. For closed strings we find decay rates proportional to $Mm_{R}^{(1-D)/2}$, where $m_{R}$ is the reduced mass of the decy products. Ourmethod yields exact interaction rates valid for all mass ranges and may providea fully microscopic basis, not limited to the long string approximation, forthe interactions in the Boltzmann equation approach to hot string gases.
