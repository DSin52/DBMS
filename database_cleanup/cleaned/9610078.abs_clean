second class constraintsAuthors: A.A. Deriglazov

It is shown that the phase space of a dynamical system subject to secondclass constraints can be extended by ghost variables in such a way that someformal analogies of the $\Omega$-charge and the unitarizing Hamiltonian can beconstructed. Then BFV-type path integral representation for the generatingfunctional of Green's functions is written and shown to coincide with thestandard one.
