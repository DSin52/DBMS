A D3 brane in the background of NS5 branes is studied semi-classically. Theconditions for preserved supersymmetry are derived, leading to a differentialequation for the shape of the D3 brane. The solutions of this equation areanalyzed. For a D3 brane intersecting the NS5 branes, the angle of approach isknown to be restricted to discrete values. Four different ways to obtain thisquantization are described. In particular, it is shown that, assuming the D3brane avoids intersecting a {\em single} NS5 brane, the above discrete valuescorrespond to the different possible positions of the D3 branes among the NS5branes.
