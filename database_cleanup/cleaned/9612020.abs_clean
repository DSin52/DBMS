Authors: D. Karczewska, R. Manka

Comments: latex,psfig.sty, 15 pages, 4 PostScript Figures, after request

Particle PhysicsA numerical study of static, spherically symmetric sphaleron solutions in thestandard model coupled to the dilaton field is presented. We show thatsphaleron is surrounded by strong dilaton cloud which vanishes inside thesphaleron.
