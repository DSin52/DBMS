A global model of $q$-deformation for the quasi--orthogonal Lie algebrasgenerating the groups of motions of the four--dimensional affine Cayley--Kleingeometries is obtained starting from the three dimensional deformations. It isshown how the main algebraic classical properties of the CK systems can beimplemented in the quantum case. Quantum deformed versions of either thespace--time or space symmetry algebras (Poincar\'e (3+1), Galilei (3+1), 4DEuclidean as well as others) appear in this context as particular cases andseveral $q$-deformations for them are directly obtained.
