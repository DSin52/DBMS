The matrix sine-Gordon theory, a matrix generalization of the well-knownsine-Gordon theory, is studied. In particular, the $A_{3}$-generalization wherefields take value in $SU(2)$ describes integrable deformations of conformalfield theory corresponding to the coset $SU(2) \times SU(2) /SU(2)$. Variousclassical aspects of the matrix sine-Gordon theory are addressed. We find exactsolutions, solitons and breathers which generalize those of the sine-Gordontheory with internal degrees of freedom, by applying the Zakharov-Shabatdressing method and explain their physical properties. Infinite currentconservation laws and the B\"{a}cklund transformation of the theory areobtained from the zero curvature formalism of the equation of motion. From theB\"{a}cklund transformation, we also derive exact solutions as well as anonlinear superposition principle by making use of the Bianchi's permutabilitytheorem.
