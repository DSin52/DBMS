We calculate the Kac determinant for the quasi-finite representation of \Winfalgebra up to level 8. It vanishes only when the central charge is integer. Wegive an algebraic construction of null states and propose the characterformulae. The character of the Verma module is related to free fields in threedimensions which has rather exotic modular properties.
