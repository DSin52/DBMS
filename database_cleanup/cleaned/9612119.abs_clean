Title: A new supersymmetry

Authors: Itzhak Bars and Costas Kounnas

We propose a new supersymmetry in field theory that generalizes standardsupersymmetry and we construct field theoretic models that provide some of itsrepresentations. This symmetry combines a finite number of standard 4Dsupersymmetry multiplets into a single multiplet with a new type ofKaluza-Klein embedding in higher dimensions. We suggest that this mechanism mayhave phenomenological applications in understanding family unification. Thealgebraic structure, which has a flavor of W-algebras, is directly motivated byS-theory and its application in black holes. We show connections to previousproposals in the literature for 12 dimensional supergravity, Yang-Mills, (2,1)heterotic superstrings and Matrix models that attempt to capture part of thesecret theory behind string theory.
