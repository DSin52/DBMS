Solvable and Integrable SystemsIn a recent paper (hep-th/9811108), Saveliev and the author showed that thereexits an on-shell light cone gauge where the non-linear part of the fieldequations reduces to a (super) version of Yang's equations which may be solvedby methods inspired by the ones previously developed for self-dual Yang-Millsequations in four dimensions. Later on (hep-th/9903218), the analogy betweenthese latter theories and the present ones was pushed further by writing down aset of super partial linear differential equations which are the analogues ofthe Lax pair of Belavin and Zakharov. Using this Lax representation, it isshown in the present article that solution-generating techniques are at work,which are similar to the ones developed for four dimensional self-dualYang-Mills theories in the late seventies.
