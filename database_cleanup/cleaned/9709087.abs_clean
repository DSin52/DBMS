We address the issue of correspondence between classical supergravity andquantum super Yang-Mills (or Matrix theory) expressions for the long-distance,low-velocity interaction potentials between 0-branes and various bound statesof branes. The leading-order potentials are known to be reproduced by the F^4terms in the 1-loop SYM effective action. Using self-consistencyconsiderations, we determine a universal combination of F^6 terms in the 2-loopSYM effective action that corresponds to the subleading terms in thesupergravity potentials in many cases, including 0-brane scattering off 1/8supersymmetric 410 and 4440 bound states representing extremal D=5 and D=4extremal black holes. We give explicit descriptions of the these configurationsin terms of 1/4 supersymmetric SYM backgrounds on dual tori. Under a properchoice of the gauge field backgrounds, the 2-loop F^6 SYM action reproduces thefull expression for the subleading term in the supergravity potentials,including its subtle v^2 part.
