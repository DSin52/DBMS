Title: TG-Equivariance of Connections and Gauge Transformations

Authors: H. M. Bosselmann, N.A. Papadopoulos

Comments: 12 pages

We consider the notion of a connection on a principal bundle $P(M,G)$ fromthe point of view of the action of the tangential group $TG$. This leads to anew definition of a connection and allows to interpret gauge transformations aseffect of the $TG$ action.
