Inthis scenario, the energy density stored in the modes of trans-Planckianwave-numbers but sub-Hubble frequencies produced by amplification of the vacuumquantum fluctuations would account naturally for the dark energy. The presentarticle examines this model in detail and shows step by step that it does notwork. In particular, we show that this model cannot make definite predictionssince there is no well-defined vacuum state in the region of wave-numbersconsidered, hence the initial data cannot be specified unambiguously. We alsoshow that for most choices of initial data this scenario implies the productionof a large amount of energy density (of order M_Planck^4) for modes withmomenta of order M_Planck, far in excess of the background energy density. Weevaluate the amount of fine-tuning in the initial data necessary to avoid thisback-reaction problem and find it is of order H/M_Planck. We also argue thatthe equation of state of the trans-Planckian modes is not vacuum-like.Therefore this model does not provide a suitable explanation for the darkenergy.
