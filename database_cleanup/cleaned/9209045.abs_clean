A canonical Lorentz invariant field theory extension of collective fieldtheory of d=1 matrix models is presented.We show that the low density, discrete, sector of collective field theoryincludes single eigenvalue Euclidean instantons which tunnel between differentvacua of the extended theory. These "stringy" instantons inducenon-perturbative effective operators of strength $e^{-{1/g}}$. The relationshipof the world sheet description of string theory and Liouville theory to theeffective space-time theory is explained.
