We introduce a diagramatic notation for supersymmetric gauge theories. Thenotation is a tool for exploring duality and helps to present the field contentof more complicated models in a simple visual way. We introduce the notationwith a few examples from the literature. The power of the formalism allows usto study new models with gauge group $(SU(N))^k$ and their duals. Amongst theseare models which, contrary to a naive analysis, possess no conformal phase.
