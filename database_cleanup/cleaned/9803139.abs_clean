We complete the process of classifying all supersymmetric theories withquantum modified moduli. We present all the supersymmetric gauge theories basedon a simple orthogonal or exceptional group that exhibit a quantum modifiedmoduli space. The quantum modified constraints of theories derived froms-confining theories are invariant under all symmetries. However, theories thatcannot be obtained by a deformation of an s-confining theory may haveconstraints that are covariant, rather than invariant.
