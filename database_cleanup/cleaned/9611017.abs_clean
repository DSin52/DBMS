We test the conjectured Type I-Heterotic Duality in four dimensions byanalyzing a given class of higher derivative F-terms of the form $F_gW^{2g}$,with W the N=2 gravitational superfield. We study a particular dual pair oftheories, the O(2,2) heterotic model and a type I model based on the K3 $Z_2$orbifold theory constructed by Gimon and Polchinski, further compactified on atorus. The $F_g$ couplings appear at 1-loop on both theories; because of theweak-weak nature of this duality in four dimensions, it is meaningful tocompare the heterotic $F_g$'s with the corresponding type I couplingsperturbatively. We compute the $F_g$'s in type I, showing that they receivecontributions only from N=2 BPS states and that in the appropriate limit theycoincide with the heterotic couplings, in agreement with the given duality.
