We present in detail a class of solutions to the $4D SU(\infty)$ Moyal AntiSelf Dual Yang Mills equations that are related to $reductions$ of thegeneralized Moyal Nahm quations using the Ivanova-Popov ansatz. The formeryields solutions to the ASDYM/SDYM equations for arbitary gauge groups. Afurther dimensional reduction yields solutions to the Moyal Anti Self DualGravitational equations. The Self Dual Yang Mills /Self Dual Gravity caserequires a separate study. SU(2) and $SU(\infty)$ (continuous) Moyal Todaequations are derived and solutions to the latter equations in $implicit$ formare proposed via the Lax-Brockett double commutator formalism . An explicit maptaking the Moyal heavenly form (after a rotational Killing symmetry reduction)into the SU(2) Moyal Toda field is found. Finally, the generalized Moyal Nahmequations are conjectured that contain the continuous $SU(\infty)$ Moyal Todaequation after a suitable reduction. Three different embeddings of the threedifferent types of Moyal Toda equations into the Moyal Nahm equations arediscussed.
