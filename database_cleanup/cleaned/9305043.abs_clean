Chiral vertex-operators are defined for continuous quantum-group spins $J$from free-field realizations of the Coulomb-gas type. It is shown that thesegeneralized chiral vertex operators satisfy closed braiding relations on theunit circle, which are given by an extension in terms of orthogonal polynomialsof the braiding matrix recently derived by Cremmer, Gervais and Roussel. Thisleads to a natural extension of the Liouville exponentials to continuous powersthat remain local.
