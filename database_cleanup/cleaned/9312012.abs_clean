The effective formulas reducing the two-dimensional Hermite polynomials tothe classical (one-dimensional) orthogonal polynomials are given. Newone-parameter generating functions for these polynomials are derived.Asymptotical formulas for large values of indices are found. The applicationsto the squeezed one-mode states and to the time-dependent quantum harmonicoscillator are considered.
