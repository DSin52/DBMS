We present a matrix model which interpolates between type IIA and type IIB NSfive-branes. The matrix description involves a three-dimensional bulk quantumfield theory interacting with impurities localized in one spatial direction. Weobtain a dual matrix formulation for the exotic six-dimensional theory oncoincident type IIB NS five-branes by studying the T-dual description in termsof Kaluza-Klein monopoles in type IIA string theory. After decoupling the bulkphysics, the matrix description reduces to the conformal field theory of theCoulomb branch for the type IIA matrix string propagating on certain singularspaces. In many ways, this dual realization of superconformal theories is thetwo-dimensional analogue of three-dimensional mirror symmetry.
