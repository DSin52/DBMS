Some relationships between string theories and eleven-dimensionalsupergravity are discussed and reviewed. We see how some relationships can bederived from others. The cases of N=2 supersymmetry in nine dimensions and N=4supersymmetry in four dimensions are discussed in some detail. The latter caseleads to consideration of quotients of a K3 surface times a torus and to apossible peculiar relationship between eleven-dimensional supergravity and theheterotic strings in ten dimensions.
