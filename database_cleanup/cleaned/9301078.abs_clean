We define a Chern- Simons Lagrangian for a system of planar particlestopologically interacting at a distance. The anyon model appears as aparticular case where all the particles are identical. We propose exact N-bodyeigenstates, set up a perturbative algorithm, discuss the case where someparticles are fixed on a lattice, and also consider curved manifolds. PACS
