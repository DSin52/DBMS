Using the representation of the quantum group $SL_q$(2) by the Weylope\-ra\-tors of the canonical commutation relations in quantum mechanics, weconstruct and solve a new vertex model on a square lattice. Random variables onhorizontal bonds are Ising variables, and those on the vertical bonds take halfpositive integer values. The vertices is subjected to a genera\-li\-zed form ofthe so-called ``ice-rule'', its property are studied in details and its freeenergy calculated with the method of quantum inverse scattering. Remarkably inanalogy with the usual six-vertex model, there exists a ``Free-Fermion'' limitwith a novel rich operator structure. The existing algebraic structure suggestsa possible connection with a lattice neutral plasma of charges, via theFermion-Boson correspondence.
