The component form of the equations of motion for the 5-brane ineleven-dimensions is derived from the superspace equations. These equations arefully covariant in six-dimensions. It is shown that double-dimensionalreduction of the bosonic equations gives the equations of motion for a 4-branein ten dimensions governed by the Born-Infeld action.
