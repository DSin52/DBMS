We introduce new variables in four dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory. Thesevariables emerge when we sum the path integral over classical solutions andrepresent the summation as an integral over appropriate degrees of freedom. Inthis way we get an effective field theory with SU(N)$\times$SU(N) gaugesymmetry. In the instanton approximation our effective theory has in addition aN=2 supersymmetry, and when we sum over all possible solutions we find aParisi-Sourlas supersymmetry. These extra symmetries can then be brokenexplicitly by a SU(N) invariant and power counting renormalizable mass term.Our results suggest that the confinement mechanism which has been recentlyidentified in the N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory might also help tounderstand color confinement in ordinary, pure Yang-Mills theory. Inparticular, there appears to be an intimate relationship between the N=2supersymmetry approach to confinement and the Parisi-Sourlas dimensionalreduction.
