We prove that for $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$ quantum gauge theory on a torus,holonomy expectation values with respect to the Yang-Mills measure $d\mu_T(\o)=N_T^{-1}e^{-S_{YM}(\o)/T}[{\cal D}\o]$ converge, as $T\downarrow 0$, tointegrals with respect to a symplectic volume measure $\mu_0$ on the modulispace of flat connections on the bundle. These moduli spaces and the symplecticstructures are described explicitly.
