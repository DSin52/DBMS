We extent the previous determinations of nonasymptotic critical behavior ofPhys. Rev B32, 7209 (1985) and B35, 3585 (1987) to accurate expressions of thecomplete classical-to-critical crossover (in the 3-d field theory) in terms ofthe correlation length, the susceptibility and the specific heat in thehomogeneous phase for the n-vector model (n=1 to 3) and 2) for the spontaneousmagnetization (coexistence curve), the susceptibility and the specific heat inthe inhomogeneous phase for the Ising model (n=1). The present calculationsinclude the seventh loop order of Murray and Nickel (1991) and closely accountfor the up-to-date estimates of universal asymptotic critical quantities(exponents and amplitude combinations) provided by Guida and Zinn-Justin [J.Phys. A31, 8103 (1998)].
