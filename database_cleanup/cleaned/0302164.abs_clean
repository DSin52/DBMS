Theory, Berlin, Germany, 26-30 Aug 2002; 9pp, plain LatexWe show how to cast an interacting system of M--branes into manifestlygauge-invariant form using an arrangement of higher-dimensional Dirac surfaces.Classical M--theory has a cohomologically nontrivial and noncommutative set ofgauge symmetries when written using a ``doubled'' formalism containing 3-formand 6-form gauge fields. We show how the arrangement of Dirac surfaces allowsan integral subgroup of these symmetries to be preserved at the quantum level.The proper context for discussing these large gauge transformations is relativecohomology, in which the 3-form transformation parameters become exact whenrestricted to the five-brane worldvolume. This structure yields the correctlattice of M-theory brane charges.
