Drexel Symposium on Quantum Nonintegrability)SystemsWe consider a simple quantum system subjected to a classical random force.Under certain conditions it is shown that the noise-averaged Wigner function ofthe system follows an integro-differential stochastic Liouville equation. Inthe simple case of polynomial noise-couplings this equation reduces to ageneralized Fokker-Planck form. With nonlinear noise injection new ``quantumdiffusion'' terms arise that have no counterpart in the classical case. Twowith a localized noise source and the other with a spatially modulated noisesource.
