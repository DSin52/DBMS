For semisimple groups, possibly multiplied by U(1)'s, the number ofYang-Mills gauge fields is equal to the number of generators of the group. Inthis paper, it is shown that, for non-semisimple groups, the number ofYang-Mills fields can be larger. These additional Yang-Mills fields are notirrelevant because they appear in the gauge transformations of the originalYang-Mills fields. Such non-semisimple Yang-Mills theories may lead to physicalconsequences worth studying. The non-semisimple group with only two generatorsthat do not commute is studied in detail.
