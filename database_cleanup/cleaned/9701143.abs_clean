We study axion-graviton scattering from a system of two D$0$-branes in a TypeII superstring theory, a process which does not occur on a single brane. Thetwo D$0$-branes interact via the exchange of closed string states which form acylinder joining them. By compactifying on the $Z_3$ orbifold we find a nonvanishing amplitude coming from the odd spin structure sector, thus from theexchanged RR states. We compute, in particular, the leading term of theamplitude at large distance from the branes, which corresponds to taking afield theory limit. This seems to suggest that the process takes place throughthe coupling of an axion to the RR states exchanged between the 0-branes.
