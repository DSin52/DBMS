Based on the recently discovered K-theory description of D-branes in stringtheory a K-theory interpretation of the topology of gauge conditions for fourdimensional gauge theories, in particular 't Hooft abelian projection, ispresented. The interpretation of the dyon effect in terms of K^{-1} is alsodiscussed. In the context of type IIA strings, D-p branes are also interpretedas gauge fixing singularities.
