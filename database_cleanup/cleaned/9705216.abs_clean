We show how the widely used concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking can beexplained in causal perturbation theory by introducing a perturbative versionof quantum gauge invariance. Perturbative gauge invariance, formulatedexclusively by means of asymptotic fields, is discussed for the simple exampleof Abelian U(1) gauge theory (Abelian Higgs model). Our findings are relevantfor the electroweak theory, as pointed out elsewhere.
