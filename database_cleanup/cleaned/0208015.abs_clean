We consider giant graviton probes of 11-dimensional supergravity solutionswhich are lifts of arbitrary solutions of 4-dimensional U(1)^4 and7-dimensional U(1)^2 gauged supergravities. We show that the structure of thelift ansatze is sufficient to explicitly find a solution for the embedding andmotion of the M5- or M2-brane in the internal space. The brane probe actionthen reduces to that of a massive charged particle in the gauged supergravity,demonstrating that probing the gauged supergravity with such particles isequivalent to the more involved 11-dimensional brane probe calculation. As anapplication of this we use these particles to probe superstar geometries whichare conjectured to be sourced by giant gravitons.
