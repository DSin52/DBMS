We study the Coulomb-Higgs duality of N=2 supersymmetric Abelian Chern-Simonstheories in 2+1 dimensions, by compactifying dual pairs on a circle of radius Rand comparing the resulting N=(2,2) theories in 1+1 dimensions. Below thecompactification scale, the theory on the Higgs branch reduces to thenon-linear sigma model on a toric manifold. In the dual theory on the Coulombbranch, the Kaluza-Klein modes generate an infinite tower of contributions tothe superpotential. After resummation, in the limit R->0 the superpotentialbecomes that of the Landau-Ginzburg model which is the two-dimensional mirrorof the toric sigma model. We further examine the conjecture of all-scalethree-dimensional mirror symmetry and observe that it is consistent with mirrorsymmetry in 1+1 dimensions.
