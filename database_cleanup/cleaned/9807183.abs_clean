In view of two-dimensional topological gravity coupled to matter, we studythe Seiberg-Witten theory for the low-energy behavior of N=2 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory with ADE gauge groups. We construct a new solution of thePicard-Fuchs equations obeyed by the Seiberg-Witten periods. Our solution isexpressed as the linear sum over the infinite set of one-point functions ofgravitational descendants in $d<1$ topological strings. It turns out that oursolution provides the power series expansion around the origin of the quantummoduli space of the Coulomb branch. For SU(N) gauge group we show how theSeiberg-Witten periods are reconstructed from the present solution.
