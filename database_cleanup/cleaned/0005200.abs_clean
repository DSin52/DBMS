Title: On Adelic Strings

Authors: Branko Dragovich

Comments: 9 pages

New approach to p-adic and adelic strings, which takes into account that notonly world sheet but also Minkowski space-time and string momenta can be p-adicand adelic, is formulated. p-Adic and adelic string amplitudes are consideredwithin Feynman's path integral formalism. The adelic Veneziano amplitude iscalculated. Some discreteness of string momenta is obtained. Also, adeliccoupling constant is equal to unity.
