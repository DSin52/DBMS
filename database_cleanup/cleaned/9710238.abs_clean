We compute the Schwinger terms in the energy-momentum tensor commutatoralgebra from the anomalies present in Weyl-invariant anddiffeomorphism-invariant effective actions for two dimensional massless scalarfields in a gravitational background. We find that the Schwinger terms are notsensitive to the regularization procedure and that they are independent of thebackground metric.
