We study the covariant quantization of the Green-Schwarz (GS) superstringsproposed recently by Berkovits. In particular, we reformulate the Berkovitsapproach in a way that clarifies its relation with the GS approach and allowsto derive in a straightforward way its extension to curved spacetimebackground. We explain the procedure working explicitly in the case of theheterotic string.
