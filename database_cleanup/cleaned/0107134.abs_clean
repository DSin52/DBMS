The creation of 4d de Sitter (inflationary) boundary gluing two d5 de Sitterbulks on the classical as well as on quantum level (with account of brane QFTvia corresponding trace anomaly induced effective action) is discussed. Quantumeffects decrease the classical de Sitter brane radius or create new de Sitterbrane with even smaller radius. It is important that brane CFT may be chosen tobe dual to one of 5d de Sitter bulks, making the explicit relation of de Sitterbrane-world with dS/CFT correspondence. In this way, the localization ofgravity on the brane is shown. Moving (time-dependent) de Sitter brane in d5SdS BH is considered. In the special coordinate system where brane equationslook like quantum-corrected FRW equations the comparison with similar braneequations in SAdS BH bulk is done.
