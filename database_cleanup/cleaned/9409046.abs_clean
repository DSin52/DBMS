The BRST transformations for gravity in Ashtekar variables are obtained byusing the Maurer-Cartan horizontality conditions. The BRST cohomology inAshtekar variables is calculated with the help of an operator $\delta$introduced by S.P. Sorella, which allows to decompose the exterior derivativeas a BRST commutator. This BRST cohomology leads to the differential invariantsfor four-dimensional manifolds.
