Authors: Yoonbai Kim, Kei-ichi Maeda and Nobuyuki Sakai

Comments: 7 pages of LaTeX, Talk given at Second Pacific Winter School for

Theoretical Physics, Mt. Sorak, Korea, Feb. 1995We review how the continuous symmetry can support a soliton inside ahigh-temperature bubble at the time of its nucleation. This solitonic island indisoriented phase remains stable during the growth of bubbles before theircollision.
