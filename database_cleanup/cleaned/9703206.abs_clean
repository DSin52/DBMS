String theory one-loop threshold corrections are studied in a backgroundfield approach due to Kiritsis and Kounnas which uses space-time curvature asan infrared regulator. We review the conformal field theory aspects using thesemiwormhole space-time solution. The comparison of string and effective fieldtheories vacuum functionals is made for the low derivative order, as well asfor certain higher-derivative, gauge and gravitational interactions. We studythe dependence on the infrared cut-off. Numerical applications are consideredfor a sample of four-dimensional abelian orbifold models. The implications onthe perturbative string theory unification are examined. We present numericalresults for the gauge interactions coupling constants as well as for thequadratic order gravitational ($R^2$) and the quartic order gauge ($F^4$)interactions.
