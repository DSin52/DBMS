We start from the quantum Miura transformation [7] for the $W$-algebraassociated with $GL(n)$ group and find an evident formula for quantumL-operator as well as for the action of $W_l$ currents (l=1,..,n) on elementsof the completely degenerated n-dimensional representation. Quantum formulaeare obtained through the deformation of the pseudodifferential symbols. Thisdeformation is independent of $n$ and preserves Adler's trace. Our maininstrument of the proof is the notation of pseudodifferential symbol with rightaction which has no counterpart in classical theory.
