The full ``classical" Dirac-Maxwell equations are considered under varioussimplifying assumptions. A reduction of the equations is performed in the casewhen the Dirac field is {\em static} and a further reduction is performed inthe case of {\em spherical symmetry}. These static spherically symmetricequations are examined in some detail and a numerical solution presented. Some* Spherical symmetry necessitates the existence of a magnetic monopole.* There exists a uniquely defined solution, determined only by the demand thatthe solution be analytic at infinity.* The equations describe highly compact objects with an inner onion-likeshell structure.
