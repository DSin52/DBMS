We extend the path-integral approach to bosonization to the case in which thefermionic interaction is non-local. In particular we obtain a completelybosonized version of a Thirring-like model with currents coupled by general(symmetric) bilocal potentials. The model contains the Tomonaga-Luttinger modelas a special case; exploiting this fact we study the basic properties of themodes, etc. Finally we discuss the generalization of our procedure to thenon-Abelian case, thus providing a new tool to be used in the study of 1-dmany-body systems with spin-flipping interactions.
