In this work a field theoretical model is constructed to describe thestatistical mechanics of an arbitrary number of topologically linked polymersin the context of the analytical approach of Edwards. As an application, theeffects of the topological interactions are studied in the one loopapproximation. A natural way to include in the treatment also moresophisticated link invariants than the Gauss linking number is outlined.
