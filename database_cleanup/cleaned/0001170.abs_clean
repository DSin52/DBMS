We discuss how the BPS branes of M-theory could be described as bound statesof non-BPS M10-branes. This conjectured M10-brane is constructed as an unstablespacetime-filling brane in the massive eleven dimensional supergravity definedwith a Killing direction, such that 1) the BPS M9-brane is obtained after thetachyonic mode of an M2-brane ending on it condenses, and 2) it gives thenon-BPS D9-brane of the type IIA theory upon reduction. The existence of othernon-BPS M-branes is also discussed, together with their possible stabilisationwithin the Horava-Witten construction.
