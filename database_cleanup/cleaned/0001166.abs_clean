We obtain the zero mode effective action for gravitating objects in the bulkof dilatonic domain walls. Without additional fields included in the bulkaction, the zero mode effective action reproduces the action in one lowerdimensions obtained through the ordinary Kaluza-Klein (KK) compactification,only when the transverse (to the domain wall) component of the bulk metric doesnot have non-trivial term depending on the domain wall worldvolume coordinates.With additional fields included in the bulk action, non-trivial dependence ofthe transverse metric component on the domain wall worldvolume coordinatesappears to be essential in reproducing the lower-dimensional action obtainedvia the ordinary KK compactification. We find, in particular, that theeffective action for the charged (p+1)-brane in the domain wall bulk reproducesthe action for the p-brane in one lower dimensions.
