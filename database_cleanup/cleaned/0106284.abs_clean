Title: Holography&Transplantation and All That (The tip of an iceberg for a

paradigmatic change in QFT?)Authors: Bert Schroer, (CBPF, Rio de Janeiro)

addedRecent developments in local quantum physics have led to revolutionaryconceptual changes in the thinking about a more intrinsic formulation and inparticular about unexpected aspects of localized degrees of freedom. Thisparadigmatic change is most spectacular in a new rigorous form of``holography'' and ``transplantation'' as generic properties in QFT beyond therather special geometric black hole setting in which the geometricmanifestations of these properties were first noted. This new setting is alsothe natural arena for understanding the rich world of ``black hole analogs''(``dumb holes'' for phonons). The mathematical basis for all this is theextremely powerful Tomita-Takesaki modular theory in operator algebras. Therich consequences of the impressive blend of this theory with physicallocalization entails among other things the presence of ``fuzzy'' actinginfinite dimensional symmetry groups, a spacetime interpretation and derivationof the d=1+1 Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra (i.e. a better understanding of thebootstrap-formfactor approach) and the noncommutative multiparticle structureof ``free'' anyons based on the use of Wigner representation theory.
