We discuss properties of D-brane configurations in the matrix model of typeIIB superstring recently proposed by Ishibashi, Kawai, Kitazawa and Tsuchiya.We calculate central charges in supersymmetry algebra at infinite N andassociate them with one- and five-branes present in IIB superstring theory. Weconsider classical solutions associated with static three- and five-branes andcalculate their interactions at one loop in the matrix model. We discuss someaspects of the matrix-model formulation of IIB superstring.
