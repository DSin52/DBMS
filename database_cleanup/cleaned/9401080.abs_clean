177-184We derive the expressions for $\psi$-functions and generic solutions oflattice principal chiral equations, lattice KP hierarchy and hierarchyincluding lattice N-wave type equations. $\tau$-function of $n$ free fermionsplays fundamental role in this context. Miwa's coordinates in our case appearas the lattice parameters.
