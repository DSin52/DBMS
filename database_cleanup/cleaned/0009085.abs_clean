Rochester NY, May 2000We study the geometry of a two-sheeted space-time within the framework ofnon-commutative geometry. As a prelude to the Standard Model in curvedspace-time, we present a model of a left- and a right- chiral field living onthe two sheeted-space time and construct the action functionals that describetheir interactions.
