We study the noncommutative geometry of a two-leaf Parisi--Sourlassupermanifold in Connes' formalism using different $K$-cycles over theGrassmann algebra valued functions on the supermanifold. We find that thecurvature of the trivial noncommutative vector bundle defines in the simplestcase the super Yang--Mills action coupled to a scalar field. By considering amodified Dirac operator and a suitable limit of its parameters we then obtainan action that turns out to be the continuum limit of the induced QCD inKazakov--Migdal model.
