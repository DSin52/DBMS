We develop quantization aspects of our Liouville approach to non-criticalstrings, proposing a path-integral formulation of a second quantization ofstring theory, that incorporates naturally the couplings of string sources tobackground fields. Such couplings are characteristic of macroscopic stringsolutions and/or $D$-brane theories. Resummation over world-sheet genera in thepresence of stringy ($\sigma$-model) soliton backgrounds, and recoil effectsassociated with logarithmic operators on the world sheet, play a crucial r\^olein inducing such sources as well-defined renormalization-group counterterms.Using our Liouville renormalization group approach, we derive the appropriatesecond-order equation of motion for the $D$ brane. We discuss within thisapproach the appearance of open strings, whose ends carry non-trivialChan-Paton-like quantum numbers related to the $W_\infty$ charges oftwo-dimensional string black holes.
