In this paper we discuss the question of whether the entropy of cosmologicalhorizon in Topological Reissner-Nordstr\"om- de Sitter spaces can be describedby the Cardy-Verlinde formula, which is supposed to be an entropy formula ofconformal field theory in any dimension. Furthermore, we find that the entropyof black hole horizon can also be rewritten in terms of the Cardy-Verlindeformula for these black holes in de Sitter spaces, if we use the definition dueto Abbott and Deser for conserved charges in asymptotically de Sitter spaces.Our result is in favour of the dS/CFT correspondence.
