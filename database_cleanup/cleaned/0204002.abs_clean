Maximally supersymmetric spacetime algebras in eleven-dimensions, which arethe isometry superalgebras of Minkowski space, AdS_7 x S^4, AdS_4 x S^7 andpp-wave background, are related by Inonu-Wigner contractions. Thesuper-AdS_{4(7)} x S^{7(4)} algebras allow to introduce two contractionparameters, the one for the flat limit to the super-Poincare algebra and theother for a Penrose limit to the super-pp-wave algebra. Under thesecontractions supersymmetries are maintained because the Jacobi identity ofthree supercharges holds for any values of contraction parameters.
