We give a formal proof of the equivalence of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian BRSTquantization. This is done for a generic $Sp(2)$-symmetric theory using flat(Darboux) coordinates. A new quantum master equation is derived in aHamiltonian setting which contains all the Hamiltonian fields and momenta of agiven theory.
