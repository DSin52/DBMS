New loop equations for all genera in $c = \frac{1}{2}$ non-critical stringtheory are constructed. Our loop equations include two types of loops, loopswith all Ising spins up (+ loops) and those with all spins down ( $-$ loops).The loop equations generate an algebra which is a certain extension of $W_3$algebra and are equivalent to the $W_3$ constraints derived before in thematrix-model formulation of 2d gravity. Application of these loop equations toconstruction of Hamiltonian for $c = \frac{1}{2}$ string field theory isconsidered.
