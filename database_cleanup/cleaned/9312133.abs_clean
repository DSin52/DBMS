The problem of diagonalization of the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian,governing dynamics of an electron on a two-dimensional triangular or squarelattice in external uniform magnetic field, applied perpendicularly to thelattice plane, the flux through lattice cell, divided by the elementary quantumflux, being rational number, is reduced to generalized Bethe ansatz likeequations on high genus algebraic curve. Our formulae for the trigonometriccase, where genus of the curve vanishes, contain as a particular case recentresult of Wiegmann and Zabrodin.
