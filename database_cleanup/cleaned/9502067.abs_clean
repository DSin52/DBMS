Functional equations, in the form of fusion hierarchies, are studied for thetransfer matrices of the fused restricted $A_{n-1}^{(1)}$ lattice models ofJimbo, Miwa and Okado. Specifically, these equations are solved analyticallyfor the finite-size scaling spectra, central charges and some conformalweights. The results are obtained in terms of Rogers dilogarithm and correspondto coset conformal field theories based on the affine Lie algebra$A_{n-1}^{(1)}$ with GKO pair $A^{(1)}_{n-1}\; \oplus A^{(1)}_{n-1}\;\supset \;A^{(1)}_{n-1}$.
