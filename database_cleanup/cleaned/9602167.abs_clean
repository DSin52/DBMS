We study the moduli space for an arbitrary number of BPS monopoles in a gaugetheory with an arbitrary gauge group that is maximally broken to $U(1)^k$. Fromthe low energy dynamics of well-separated dyons we infer the asymptotic form ofthe metric for the moduli space. For a pair of distinct fundamental monopoles,the space thus obtained is $R^3 \times(R^1\times {\cal M}_0)/Z$ where ${\calM}_0$ is the Euclidean Taub-NUT manifold. Following the methods of Atiyah andHitchin, we demonstrate that this is actually the exact moduli space for thiscase. For any number of such objects, we show that the asymptotic form remainsnonsingular for all values of the intermonopole distances and that it has thesymmetries and other characteristics required of the exact metric. We thereforeconjecture that the asymptotic form is exact for these cases also.
