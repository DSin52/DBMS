We construct maximally supersymmetric gauged N=16 supergravity in threedimensions, thereby obtaining an entirely new class of AdS supergravities.These models are not derivable from any known higher-dimensional theory,indicating the existence of a new type of supergravity beyond D=11. They areexpected to be of special importance also for the conjectured AdS/CFTcorrespondence. One of their noteworthy features is a nonabelian generalizationof the duality between scalar and vector fields in three dimensions. Among thepossible gauge groups, SO(8)xSO(8) is distinguished as the maximal compactgauge group, but there are also more exotic possibilities such as F_4 x G_2.
