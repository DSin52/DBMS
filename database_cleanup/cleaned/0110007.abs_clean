Title: Les Houches Lectures on De Sitter Space

Authors: Marcus Spradlin, Andrew Strominger, Anastasia Volovich

Comments: Latex, 29 pages, 8 figures

These lectures present an elementary discussion of some background materialrelevant to the problem of de Sitter quantum gravity. The first two lecturesdiscuss the classical geometry of de Sitter space and properties of quantumfield theory on de Sitter space, especially the temperature and entropy of deSitter space. The final lecture contains a pedagogical discussion of theappearance of the conformal group as an asymptotic symmetry group, which iscentral to the dS/CFT correspondence. A (previously lacking) derivation ofasymptotically de Sitter boundary conditions is also given.
