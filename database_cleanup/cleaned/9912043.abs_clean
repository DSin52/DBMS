D0 brane (D-particle) and D1 brane actions possess first and second classconstraints that result in local $\kappa$ symmetry. The $\kappa$ symmetry ofthe D-particle and the D1 brane is extended here into a larger symmetry($\kappa_-$ and $\kappa_+$) in a larger phase space by turning second classconstraints into first class. Different gauge fixings of these symmetriesresult in different presentations of these systems while a "unitary" gaugefixing of the new $ \kappa_+$ symmetry retrieves the original action with$\kappa_- = \kappa $ symmetry. For D1 brane our extended phase space makes allconstraints into first class in the case of vanishing world sheet electricfield (namely $(0, 1)$ string).
