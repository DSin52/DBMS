We review some applications of tree-level (classical) relations betweengravity and gauge theory that follow from string theory. Together with$D$-dimensional unitarity, these relations can be used to perturbativelyquantize gravity theories, i.e. they contain the necessary information forobtaining loop contributions. We also review recent applications of these ideasshowing that N=1 D=11 supergravity diverges, and review arguments that N=8 D=4supergravity is less divergent than previously thought, though it does appearto diverge at five loops. Finally, we describe field variables for theEinstein-Hilbert Lagrangian that help clarify the perturbative relationshipbetween gravity and gauge theory.
