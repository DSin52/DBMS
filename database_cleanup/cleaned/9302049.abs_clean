The BRST operator cohomology of $N=2$ $2d$ supergravity coupled to matter ispresented. Descent equations for primary superfields of the matter sector arederived. We find one copy of the cohomology at ghost number one, twoindependent copies at ghost number two, and conjecture that there is a copy atghost number three. The $N=2$ string has a twisted $N=4$ superconformalsymmetry generated by the $N=2$ superstress tensor, the BRST supercurrent, theantighost superfield, and the ghost number supercurrent.
