The interplay between gravitational couplings on branes and the occurrence offractional flux in low dimensional orientifolds is examined. It is argued thatgravitational couplings need to be assigned not only to D-branes but also toorientifold planes. The fractional charges of the orientifold $d$-planes can beunderstood in terms of flux quantization of the $d-3$ form potential andmodified Bianchi identities. Detailed results are presented for the case of thetype IIB orientifold on $T^6/Z_2$, which is dual to F-theory on a complex4-fold with terminal singularities.
