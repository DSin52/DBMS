We discuss the non-linear sigma model representing a NSR open string in acurved background with non-zero $B_{\mu\nu}$-field. With this coupling thetheory is not automatically supersymmetric, due to boundary contributions. WhenB=0 supersymmetry is ensured by the conditions that follow as the boundarycontribution to the field equations. We show that inclusion of a particularboundary term restores this state of affairs also in the presence of a$B$-field. The boundary conditions derived from the field equations in thiscase agree with those that have been proposed for constant $B$-field. Acoupling to a boundary $A_\mu$-field will modify both the boundary conditionsand affect the supersymmetry. It is shown that there is an $A$-coupling withnon-standard fermionic part that respects both the supersymmetry and the shiftsymmetry (in the $B$ and $A$ fields), modulo the (modified) boundaryconditions.
