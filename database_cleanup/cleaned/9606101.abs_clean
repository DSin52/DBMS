The Boyer-Finley equation, or $SU(\infty)$-Toda equation is both a reductionof the self-dual Einstein equations and the dispersionlesslimit of the$2d$-Toda lattice equation. This suggests that there should be a dispersiveversion of the self-dual Einstein equation which both contains the Toda latticeequation and whose dispersionless limit is the familiar self-dual Einsteinequation. Such a system is studied in this paper. The results are achieved byusing a deformation, based on an associative $\star$-product, of the algebra$sdiff(\Sigma^2)$ used in the study of the undeformed, or dispersionless,equations.
