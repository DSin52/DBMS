The generalization of the Yang-Baxter equations (YBE) in the presence of Z_2grading along both chain and time directions is presented and an integrablemodel of t-J type with staggered disposition along a chain of shifts of thespectral parameter is constructed. The Hamiltonian of the model is computed infermionic formulation. It involves three neighbour site interactions andtherefore can be considered as a zig-zag ladder model. The Algebraic BetheAnsatz technique is applied and the eigenstates, along with eigenvalues of thetransfer matrix of the model are found. In the thermodynamic limit, the lowestenergy of the model is formed by the quarter filling of the states by fermionsinstead of usual half filling.
