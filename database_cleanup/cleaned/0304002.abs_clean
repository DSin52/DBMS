Title: More on the gauge-fixed D3-brane action with dilaton-axion coupling from

N=1 superspaceAuthors: Sergei V. Ketov

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX

The gauge-fixed action of a `spacetime-filling' D3-brane with dilaton-axioncoupling is formulated in N=1 superspace. We investigate its symmetries bypaying special attention to a possible non-linearly realized extra (hidden)supersymmetry, and emphasize the need of a linear superfield coupled to anabelian Chern-Simons superfield to represent a dilaton-axion supermultiplet inthe off-shell manifestly supersymmetric approach.
