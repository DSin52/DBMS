General results on the structure of the bosonization of fermionic systems in$(2+1)$d are obtained. In particular, the universal character of the bosonizedtopological current is established and applied to generic fermionic currentinteractions. The final form of the bosonized action is shown to be given bythe sum of two terms. The first one corresponds to the bosonization of the freefermionic action and turns out to be cast in the form of a pure Chern-Simonsterm, up to a suitable nonlinear field redefinition. We show that the secondterm, following from the bosonization of the interactions, can be obtained bysimply replacing the fermionic current by the corresponding bosonizedexpression.
