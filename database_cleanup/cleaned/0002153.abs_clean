Title: Absence of Asymptotic Freedom in Non-Abelian Models

Authors: A. Patrascioiu, E. Seiler

Comments: 4 pages, 4 figures

The percolation properties of equatorial strips of the two dimensional O(3)nonlinear $\sigma$ model are investigated numerically. Convincing evidence isfound that a sufficently narrow strip does not percolate at arbitrarily lowtemperatures. Rigorous arguments are used to show that this result implies boththe presence of a massless phase at low temperature and lack of asymptoticfreedom in the massive continuum limit. A heuristic estimate of the transitiontemperature is given which is consistent with the numerical data.
