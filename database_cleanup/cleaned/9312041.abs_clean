Title: General properties of classical W algebras

Comments: 16 pages

After some definitions, we review in the first part of this talk theconstruction and classification of classical $W$ (super)algebras symmetries ofToda theories. The second part deals with more recently obtained properties. Atfirst, we show that chains of $W$ algebras can be obtained by imposingprocedure on $W$ algebras. Then we emphasize the role of the Kac-Moody part,when it exists, in a $W$ (super) algebra. Factorizing out this spin 1subalgebra gives rise to a new $W$ structure which we interpret either as arational finitely generated $W$ algebra, or as a polynomial non linear$W_\infty$ realization.
