We construct a quantum Hamiltonian operator for the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW)model in terms of the Casimir operator. This facilitates the discussion of thereduction of the WZW model to Toda field theory at the quantum level andprovides a very straightforward derivation of the quantum central charge forthe Toda field theory.
