Asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-times in pure gravity with negativecosmological constant are described, in all space-time dimensions greater thantwo, by classical degrees of freedom on the conformal boundary at space-likeinfinity. Their effective boundary action has a conformal anomaly for evendimensions and is conformally invariant for odd ones. These degrees of freedomare encoded in traceless tensor fields in the Fefferman-Graham asymptoticmetric for any choice of conformally flat boundary and generate allSchwarzschild and Kerr black holes in anti-de Sitter space-time. We argue thatthese fields describe components of an energy-momentum tensor of a boundarytheory and show explicitly how this is realized in 2+1 dimensions. There, theFefferman-Graham fields reduce to the generators of the Virasoro algebra andgive the mass and the angular momentum of the BTZ black holes. Their localexpression is the Liouville field in a general curved background.
