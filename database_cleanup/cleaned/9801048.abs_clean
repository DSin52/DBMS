The entropy of a seven dimensional Schwarzschild black hole of arbitrarylarge radius is obtained by a mapping onto a near extremal self-dualthree-brane whose partition function can be evaluated. The three-brane arisesfrom duality after submitting a neutral blackbrane, from which theSchwarzschild black hole can be obtained by compactification, to an infiniteboost in non compact eleven dimensional space-time and then to a Kaluza-Kleincompactification. This limit can be defined in precise terms and yields theBekenstein-Hawking value up to a factor of order one which can be set to beexactly one with the extra assumption of keeping only transverse braneexcitations. The method can be generalized to five and four dimensional blackholes.
