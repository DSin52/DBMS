Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Theory on q-Quantum Spaces

Authors: Stefan Schraml

Comments: 17 pages, Latex

Gauge theories on q-deformed spaces are constructed using covariantderivatives. For this purpose a ``vielbein'' is introduced, which transformsunder gauge transformations. The non-Abelian case is treated by establishing aconnection to gauge theories on commutative spaces, i.e. by a Seiberg-Wittenmap. As an example we consider the Manin plane. Remarks are made concerning therelation between covariant coordinates and covariant derivatives.
