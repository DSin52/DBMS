We discuss an infinite--dimensional k\"ahlerian manifold associated with thearea--preserving diffeomorphisms on two--dimensional torus, and,correspondingly, with a continuous limit of the $A_r$--Toda system. Inparticular, a continuous limit of the $A_r$--Grassmannians and a relatedPl\"ucker type formula are introduced as relevant notions for$W_{\infty}$--geometry of the self--dual Einstein space with the rotationalKilling vector.
