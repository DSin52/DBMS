The non-relativistic Chern-Simons theory with the single-valued anyonic fieldis proposed as an example of q-deformed field theory. The correspondingq-deformed algebra interpolating between bosons and fermions,both in positionand momentum spaces, is analyzed.A possible generalization to a space with anarbitrary dimension is suggested.
