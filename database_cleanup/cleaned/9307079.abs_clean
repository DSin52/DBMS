It is argued that a unitarity-violating but weakly CPT invariantsuperscattering matrix exists for leading-order large-$N$ dilaton gravity, ifand only if one includes in the Hilbert space planckian ``thunderpop"excitations which create white holes. CPT apparently cannot be realized in alow-energy effective theory in which such states have been integrated out.Rules for computing the leading-large-$N$ superscattering are described interms of quantum field theory on a single multiply-connected spacetime obtainedby sewing the future (past) horizons of the original spacetime with the past(future) horizons of its CPT conjugate. Some difficulties which may arise ingoing beyond leading order in $1/N$ are briefly discussed.
