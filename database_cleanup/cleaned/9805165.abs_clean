Anti-de Sitter supergravity models are considered in three dimensions.Precise asymptotic conditions involving a chiral projection are given on theRarita-Schwinger fields. Together with the known boundary conditions on thebosonic fields, these ensure that the asymptotic symmetry algebra is thesuperconformal algebra. The classical central charge is computed and found tobe equal to the one of pure gravity. It is also indicated that the asymptoticdegrees of freedom are described by 2D "induced supergravity" and that theboundary conditions "transmute" the non-vanishing components of the WZWsupercurrent into the supercharges.
