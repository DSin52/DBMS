We parametrize the gauge-fixing freedom in choosing the Lagrangian of atopological gauge theory. We compute the gauge-fixing dependence of correlatorsof equivariant operators when the compactified moduli space has a non-emptyboundary and verify that only a subset of these has a gauge independentmeaning. We analyze in detail a simple example of such anomalous topologicaltheories, 4D topological Yang-Mills on the four-sphere and instanton numberk=1.
