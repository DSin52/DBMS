F(4) supergravity, the gauge theory of the exceptional six-dimensionalAnti-de Sitter superalgebra, is coupled to an arbitrary number of vectormultiplets whose scalar components parametrize the quaternionic manifoldSO(4,n)/SO(4)\times SO(n). By gauging the compact subgroup SU(2)_d \otimes G,where SU(2)_d is the diagonal subgroup of SO(4)= SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R (theR-symmetry group of six-dimensional Poincare' supergravity) and G is a compactgroup such that dim G = n. The potential admits an AdS background for g=3m, asthe pure F(4)-supergravity. The boundary F(4) superconformal fields arerealized in terms of a singleton superfield (hypermultiplet) in harmonicsuperspace with flag manifold SU(2)/U(1)=S^2. We analize the spectrum of shortrepresentations in terms of superconformal primaries and predict generalfeatures of the K-K specrum of massive type IIA supergravity compactified onwarped AdS_6\otimes S^4.
