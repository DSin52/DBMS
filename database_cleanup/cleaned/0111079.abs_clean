We argue that the worldvolume theories of D-branes probing orbifolds withdiscrete torsion develop, in the large quiver limit, new non-commutativedirections. This provides an explicit `deconstruction' of a wide class ofnoncommutative theories. This also provides insight into the physical meaningof discrete torsion and its relation to the T-dual B field. We demonstrate thatthe strict large quiver limit reproduces the matrix theory construction ofhigher-dimensional D-branes, and argue that finite `fuzzy moose' theoriesprovide novel regularizations of non-commutative theories and explicit stringtheory realizations of gauge theories on fuzzy tori. We also comment briefly onthe relation to NCOS, (2,0) and little string theories.
