Title: A note on free bosonic vertex algebra and its conformal vectors

Authors: Atsushi Matsuo (The University of Tokyo) and Kiyokazu Nagatomo (Osaka

University)Comments: 35 pages, no figures, Latex2e files using

amsmath,amssymb,amsthm,amscd packagesWe classify all the Heisenberg and conformal vectors and determine the fullautomorphism group of the free bosonic vertex algebra without gradation. Todescribe it we introduce a notion of inner automorphisms of a vertex algebra.
