The non-commutative geometry is revisited from the perspective of ageneralized D p-brane. In particular, we analyze the open bosonic stringworld-sheet description and show that an effective non-commutative descriptionon a D p-brane corresponds to a re-normalized world-volume. The world-volumecorrelators are analyzed to make a note on the non-commutative geometry. It isargued that the U(1) gauge symmetry can be viewed in a homomorphic image spacefor the non-commutative space of coordinates with an SO(p) symmetry. In thelarge B-field limit, the non-commutativity reduces to that among the zero modesand the world-volume description is precisely in agreement with the holographicprinciple.
