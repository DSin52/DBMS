We investigate four-dimensional N=1 Type IIB orientifolds with continuousWilson lines, and their T-dual realizations as orientifolds with moving branes.When continuous Wilson lines become discrete the gauge symmetry is enhanced andthe T-dual orientifold corresponds to branes sitting at the orbifold fixedpoints. There is a field theoretic analog describing these phenomena as D- andF-flat deformations of the T-dual model, where the branes sit at the origin(original model without Wilson lines) as well as a deformation of the T-dualmodel where sets of branes sit at the fixed points (the model with discreteWilson lines). We demonstrate these phenomena for the prototype Z_3continuous Wilson lines as well as their explicit field theoretic realization.
