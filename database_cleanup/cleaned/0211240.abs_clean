We investigate the behaviour of a model with two oppositely charged scalarfields. In the Bogomol'nyi limit this may be seen as the scalar sector of N=1supersymmetric QED, and it has been shown that cosmic strings form. We examinenumerically the model out of the Bogomol'nyi limit, and show that this remainsthe case. We then add supersymmetry-breaking mass terms to the supersymmetricmodel, and show that strings still survive.Finally we consider the extension to N=2 supersymmetry withsupersymmetry-breaking mass terms, and show that this leads to the formation ofstable cosmic strings, unlike in the unbroken case.
