We consider the Krein realization of the Hilbert space for a massless scalarfield in 1+1 dimensions. We find convergence criteria and the completion of thespace of test functions ${\cal S}$ with the topology induced by the Kreinscalar product. Finally, we show that the interpretation for the Fouriercomponents as probability amplitudes for the momentum operator is lost in thiscase.
