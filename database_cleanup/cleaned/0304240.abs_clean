Title: Massless N=1 Super Sinh-Gordon

Authors: Benedicte Ponsot

Comments: 7 pages; v2

The N=1 Super Sinh-Gordon model with spontaneously broken supersymmetry isconsidered. Explicit expressions for form-factors of operators e^{\alpha \phi}of the Neveu-Schwartz sector and operators \sigma e^{\alpha \phi}, \mue^{\alpha \phi} of the Ramond sector are proposed.
