We investigate aspects of the four-dimensional effective description of braneworld scenarios based on warped compactification on anti-de Sitter space. Thelow-energy dynamics is described by visible matter gravitationally coupled to a``dark'' conformal field theory. We give the linearized description of the 4dstress tensor corresponding to an arbitrary 5d matter distribution. Inparticular a 5d falling particle corresponds to a 4d expanding shell, giving a4d interpretation of a trajectory that misses a black hole only by moving inthe fifth dimension. Breakdown of the effective description occurs when eitherfive-dimensional physics or strong gravity becomes important. In scenarios witha TeV brane, the latter can happen through production of black holes near theTeV scale. This could provide an interesting experimental window on quantumblack hole dynamics.
