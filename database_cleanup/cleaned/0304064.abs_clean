All purely bosonic supersymmetric solutions of minimal gauged supergravity infive dimensions are classified. The solutions fall into two classes dependingon whether the Killing vector constructed from the Killing spinor is time-likeor null. When it is timelike, the solutions are determined by afour-dimensional Kahler base-manifold, up to an anti-holomorphic function, andgenerically preserve 1/2 of the supersymmetry. When it is null we provide aprecise prescription for constructing the solutions and we show that theygenerically preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry. We show that AdS_5 is the uniquemaximally supersymmetric configuration. The formalism is used to construct somenew solutions, including a non-singular deformation of AdS_5, which can beuplifted to obtain new solutions of type IIB supergravity.
