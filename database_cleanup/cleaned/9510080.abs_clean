Title: String duality and massless string states

Authors: K. Behrndt

Comments: 7 pages, Latex, Talk at Trieste workshop on "Strings, gravity.."

We are discussing the $S$ \& $T$ duality for special class of heteroticstring configurations. This class of solutions includes various types of blackhole solutions and Taub-NUT geometries. It allows a self-dual point for bothdualities which corresponds to massless configurations. As string state thispoint corresponds to $N_R=1/2$ and $N_L=0$. The string/string duality isshortly discussed.
