Title: Short harmonic superfields and light-cone gauge in super-Yang-Mills

equationsAuthors: B.M. Zupnik

Comments: To be published in Proceedings of the conference "Quantization, gauge

theories and strings" dedicated to the memory of E.S. Fradkin, Moscow, June5-10, 2000We analyze the superfield equations of the 4-dimensional N=2 and N=4SYM-theories using light-cone gauge conditions and the harmonic-superspaceapproach. The harmonic superfield equations of motion are drasticallysimplified in this gauge, in particular, the basic harmonic-superfield matricesand the corresponding harmonic analytic gauge connections become nilpotenton-shell.
