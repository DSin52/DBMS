With a special choice of gauge the operator of the Klein-Fock-Gordon equationin homogeneous electric field respects boost symmetry. Using this symmetry weobtain solutions for the scalar massive field equation in such a background(boost modes in the electric field). We calculate the spectrum of particlescreated by the electric field, as seen by an accelerated observer at spatialinfinity of the right wedge of Minkowski spacetime. It is shown that thespectrum and the total number of created pairs measured by a remote uniformlyaccelerated observer in Minkowski spacetime are precisely the same as forinertial observers.
