A previously proposed two-step algorithm for calculating the expectationvalues of Chern-Simons graphs fails to determine certain crucial signs. Thestep which involves calculating tetrahedra by solving certain non- linearequations is repaired by introducing additional linear equations. As a firststep towards a new algorithm for general graphs we find useful linear equationsfor those special graphs which support knots and links. Using the improved setof equations for tetrahedra we examine the symmetries between tetrahedragenerated by arbitrary simple currents. Along the way we uncover the classicalorigin of simple-current charges. The improved skein relations also lead toexact identities between planar tetrahedra in level $K$ $G(N)$ and level $N$$G(K)$ CS theories, where $G(N)$ denotes a classical group. These results arerecast as identities for quantum $6j$-symbols and WZW braid matrices. We obtainthe transformation properties of arbitrary graphs and links under simplecurrent symmetries and rank-level duality. For links with knotted componentsthis requires precise control of the braid eigenvalue permutation signs, whichwe obtain from plethysm and an explicit expression for the (multiplicity free)signs, valid for all compact gauge groups and all fusion products.
