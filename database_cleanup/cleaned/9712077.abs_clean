We study the relationship between M theory on a nearly lightlike circle andU(N) gauge theory in p+1 dimensions. We define large N limits of these theoriesin which low energy supergravity is valid. The regularity of these limitsimplies an infinite series of nonrenormalization theorems for the gauge theoryeffective action, and the leading large N terms sum to a Born-Infeld form.Compatibility of two different large N limits that describe the samedecompactified M theory leads to a conjecture for a relation between two limitsof string theories.
