This paper is devoted to constructing a quantum version of the famous KPhierarchy, by deforming its second Hamiltonian structure, namely the nonlinear$\hat{W}_{\infty}$ algebra. This is achieved by quantizing the conformalnoncompact $SL(2,R)_{k}/U(1)$ coset model, in which $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ appearsas a hidden current algebra. For the quantum $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ algebra atlevel $k=1$, we have succeeded in constructing an infinite set of commutingquantum charges in explicit and closed form. Using them a completely integrablequantum KP hierarchy is constructed in the Hamiltonian form. A two bosonrealization of the quantum $\hat{W}_{\infty}$ currents has played a crucialrole in this exploration.
