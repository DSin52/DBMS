We give a definition for the notion of statistics in the lattice-theoretical(or propositional) formulation of quantum mechanics of Birchoff, von Neumannand Piron. We show that this formalism is compatible only with two types ofconnection between this result and the existence of exotic statistics(para-statistics, infinite statistics, braid statistics).
