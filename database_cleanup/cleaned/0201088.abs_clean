Title: Exploring the second class constraint quantization approach proposed by

Batalin and MarneliusAuthors: Michael Chesterman

Comments: 20 pages, no figures

I extend upon the paper by Batalin and Marnelius, in which they show how toconstruct and quantize a gauge theory from a Hamiltonian system with secondclass constraints. Among the avenues explored, their technique is analyzed inrelation to other well-known methods of quantization and a bracket is defined,such that the operator formalism can be fully developed. I also extend tosystems with mixed class constraints and look at some simple examples.
