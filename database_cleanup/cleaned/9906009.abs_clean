The quantum string emission by Black Holes is computed in the framework ofthe `string analogue model' (or thermodynamical approach), which is well suitedto combine QFT and string theory in curved backgrounds (particulary here, asblack holes and strings posses intrinsic thermal features and temperatures).The QFT-Hawking temperature T_H is upper bounded by the string temperature T_Sin the black hole background. The black hole emission spectrum is an incompletegamma function of (T_H - T_S). For T_H << T_S, it yields the QFT-Hawkingemission. For T_H \to T_S, it shows highly massive string states dominate theemission and undergo a typical string phase transition to a microscopic`minimal' black hole of mass M_{\min} or radius r_{\min} (inverselyproportional to T_S) and string temperature T_S. The semiclassical QFT blackhole (of mass M and temperature T_H) and the string black hole (of mass M_{min}and temperature T_S) are mapped one into another by a `Dual' transform whichlinks classical/QFT and quantum string regimes. The string back reaction effect(selfconsistent black hole solution of the semiclassical Einstein equationswith mass M_+ (radius r_+) and temperature T_+) is computed. Both, the QFT andr_S, M_{min} \leq M_+ \leq M, T_H \leq T_+ \leq T_S. The string `minimal' blackhole has a life time tau_{min} \simeq \frac{k_B c}{G \hbar} T^{-3}_S.
