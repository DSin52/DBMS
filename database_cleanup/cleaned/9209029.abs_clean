Kausch for W(2,4,6) added, W(2,3) as possible application added and a fewminor bugs correctedWe comment on a program designed for the study of local chiral algebras andtheir representations in 2D conformal field theory. Based on the algebraicapproach described by W. Nahm, this program efficiently calculates arbitraryn-point functions of these algebras. The program is designed such thatcalculations involving e.g. current algebras, W-algebras and N-Superconformalalgebras can be performed. As a non-trivial application we construct anextension of the Virasoro algebra by two fields with spin four and six usingthe N=1-Super-Virasoro algebra.
