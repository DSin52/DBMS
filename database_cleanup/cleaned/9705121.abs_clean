We study the unitary matrix model with a topological term. We call thetopological term the theta term. In the symmetric model there is the phasetransition between the strong and weak coupling regime at $\lambda_{c}=2$. Ifthe Wilson term is bigger than the theta term, there is the strong-weakcoupling phase transition at the same $\lambda_{c}$. On the other hand, if thetheta term is bigger than the Wilson term, there is only the strong couplingregime. So the topological phase transition disappears in this case.
