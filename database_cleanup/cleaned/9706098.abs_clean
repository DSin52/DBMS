Recent work has shown that complex quantum field theory emerges as astatistical mechanical approximation to an underlying noncommutative operatordynamics based on a total trace action. In this dynamics, scale invariance ofthe trace action becomes the statement $0=Re Tr T_{\mu}^{\mu}$, with $T_{\mu\nu}$ the operator stress energy tensor, and with $Tr$ the trace over theunderlying Hilbert space. We show that this condition implies the vanishing ofthe cosmological constant and vacuum energy in the emergent quantum fieldtheory. However, since the scale invariance condition does not require theoperator $T_{\mu}^{\mu}$ to vanish, the spontaneous breakdown of scaleinvariance is still permitted.
