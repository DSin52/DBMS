The connection between Lorentz invariance violation and noncommutativity offields in a quantum field theory is investigated. A new dispersion relation fora free field theory with just one additional noncommutative parameter isobtained. While values for the noncommutative scale much larger than 10^{-20}eV^{-1} are ruled out by the present experimental status, cosmic ray physicswould be compatible with and sensible to a noncommutativity arising fromquantum gravity effects. We explore the matter-antimatter asymmetry which isnaturally present in this framework.
