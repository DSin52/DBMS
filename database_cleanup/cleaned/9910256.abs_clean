We propose a gauge invariant formulation of the exact renormalization groupequation for nonsupersymmetric pure U(N) Yang-Mills theory, based on theconstruction by Tim Morris. In fact we show that our renormalization groupequation amounts to a regularized version of the loop equation, therebyproviding a direct relation between the exact renormalization group and theSchwinger-Dyson equations. We also discuss a possible implication of ourformulation to the holographic correspondence of the bulk gravity and theboundary gauge theory.
