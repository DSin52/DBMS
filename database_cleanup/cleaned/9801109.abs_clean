Title: String Duality and Novel Theories without Gravity

Comments: 13 pages, Latex. Based on a talk at the 31st International Symposium

Ahrenshoop on the Theory of Elementary Particles, Buckow, Germany, September2-6 1997We describe some of the novel 6d quantum field theories which have beendiscovered in studies of string duality. The role these theories (and their 4ddescendants) may play in alleviating the vacuum degeneracy problem in stringtheory is reviewed. The DLCQ of these field theories is presented as oneconcrete way of formulating them, independent of string theory.
