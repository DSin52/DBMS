It is argued that fractional quantum Hall effect wavefunctions can beinterpreted as conformal blocks of two-dimensional conformal field theory.Fractional statistics can be extended to nonabelian statistics and examples canbe constructed from conformal field theory. The Pfaffian state is related tothe 2D Ising model and possesses fractionally charged excitations which arepredicted to obey nonabelian statistics.
