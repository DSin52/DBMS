Higher Derivative (HD) Field Theories can be transformed into second orderequivalent theories with a direct particle interpretation. In a simple modelinvolving abelian gauge symmetries we examine the fate of the possible gaugefixings throughout this process. This example is a useful test bed for HDtheories of gravity and provides a nice intuitive interpretation of the "thirdghost" occurring there and in HD gauge theories when a HD gauge fixing isadopted.
