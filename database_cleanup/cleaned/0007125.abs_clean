We study supersymmetric domain walls in N=1 SU(N) gauge theory with 3 massiveadjoint representation chiral multiplets. This theory, known as N=1^*, can beobtained as a massive deformation of N=4 Yang-Mills theory. FollowingPolchinski and Strassler, we consider the string dual of this theory in termsof spherical 5-branes and construct BPS domain walls interpolating between themany vacua. We compare our results to field theoretic domain walls and alsofind that this work is related to the physics of expanded ``dielectric'' branesnear zero radius.
