The vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop functional in pure Yang-Millstheory on an arbitrary two-dimensional orientable manifold is studied. Weconsider the calculation of this quantity for the abelian theory in thecontinuum case and for the arbitrary gauge group and arbitrary lattice actionin the lattice case. A classification of topological sectors of the theory andthe related classification of the principal fibre bundles over two-dimensionalsurfaces are given in terms of a cohomology group. The contribution ofSU(2)-invariant connections to the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loopvariable is also analyzed and is shown to be similar to the contribution ofmonopoles.
