We present a detailed discussion of the duality between dilaton gravity onAdS_2 and open strings. The correspondence between the two theories isestablished using their symmetries and field theoretical, thermodynamic, andstatistical arguments. We use the dual conformal field theory to describetwo-dimensional black holes. In particular, all the semiclassical features ofthe black holes, including the entropy, have a natural interpretation in termsof the dual microscopic conformal dynamics. The previous results are discussedin the general framework of the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theorydualities.
