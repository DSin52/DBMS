We show that the classical equations of motion of the low-energy effectivefield theory describing the massless modes of the heterotic (or type I) stringadmit two classes of supersymmetric self--dual backgrounds. The first class,which was already considered in the literature, consists of solutions with a(conformally) flat metric coupled to axionic instantons. The second includesAsymptotically Locally Euclidean (ALE) gravitational instantonic backgroundscoupled to gauge instantons through the so--called ``standard embedding''.
