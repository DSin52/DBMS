We propose the existence of a non-supersymmetric conformal field theorysoftly broken at the TeV scale as a new mechanism for solving the hierarchyproblem. We find the imposition of conformal invariance to be very restrictivewith many predictive consequences, including severe restrictions on the fieldcontent, the number of families as well as on the structure of inter-familyYukawa couplings. A large class of potentially conformal non-supersymmetrictheories are considered and some general predictions are made about theexistence of a rich spectrum of color and weak multiplets in the TeV range.
