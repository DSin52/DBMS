Borcherds algebras represent a new class of Lie algebras which have almostall the properties that ordinary Kac-Moody algebras have, and the only majordifference is that these generalized Kac-Moody algebras are allowed to haveimaginary simple roots. The simplest nontrivial examples one can think of arethose where one adds ``by hand'' one imaginary simple root to an ordinaryKac-Moody algebra. We study the fundamental representation of this class ofexamples and prove that an irreducible module is given by the full tensoralgebra over some integrable highest weight module of the underlying Kac-Moodyalgebra. We also comment on possible realizations of these Lie algebras inphysics as symmetry algebras in quantum field theory.
