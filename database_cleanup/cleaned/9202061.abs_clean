Reductive W-algebras which are generated by bosonic fields of spin-1, asingle spin-2 field and fermionic fields of spin-3/2 are classified. Three newextended by $su(2)\oplus sp(n)$, an $N=7$ and an $N=8$ superconformal algebra.The exceptional cases can be viewed as arising a Drinfeld-Sokolov typereduction of the exceptional Lie superalgebras $G(3)$ and $F(4)$, and have anoctonionic description. The quantum versions of the superconformal algebras areconstructed explicitly in all three cases.
