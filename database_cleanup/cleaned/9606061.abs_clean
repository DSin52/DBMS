We provide an action for self-dual Yang-Mills theory which is a simpletruncation of the usual Yang-Mills action. Only vertices that violate helicityconservation maximally are included. One-loop amplitudes in the self-dualtheory then follow as a subset of the Yang-Mills ones. In light-cone gaugesthis action is almost identical to previously proposed actions, but in thisformulation the vanishing of all higher-loop amplitudes is obvious; theexplicit perturbative S-matrix is known. Similar results apply to gravity.
