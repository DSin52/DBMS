Title: The Effective Average Action Beyond First Order

Authors: H. Ballhausen

Comments: 4 pages, 1 table

A derivative expansion of the effective average action beyond first orderyields renormalization group functional flow equations which are used for thecomputation of critical exponents of the Ising universality class. The criticalexponent nu in D=3 is consistent with high-precision methods.
