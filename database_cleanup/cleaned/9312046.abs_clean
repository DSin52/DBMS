The Feynman-Vernon formalism is used to obtain a microscopic, quantummechanical derivation of black body radiation, for a massless scalar field in1+1 dimensions, weakly coupled to an environment of finite size. The modelexhibits the absorption, thermal equilibrium, and emission properties of acanonical black body, but shows that the thermal radiation propagates outwardsfrom the body, with the Planckian spectrum applying inside a wavefront regionof finite thickness. The black body environment used in the derivation can beconsidered to represent a very fine, granular medium, such as lampblack. In thecourse of developing the model for black body radiation, thermalization of asingle harmonic oscillator by a heat bath with slowly varying spectral densityis demonstrated. Bargmann-Fock coherent state variables, being convenient forproblems involving harmonic oscillators and free fields, are reviewed and thenused throughout the paper. An appendix reviews the justification for usingbaths of independent harmonic oscillators to model generic quantumenvironments.
