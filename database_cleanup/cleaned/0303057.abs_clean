Title: Dirac-Born-Infeld Action on the Tachyon Kink and Vortex

Comments: LaTeX file, 34 pages; references and other minor comments added

The tachyon effective field theory describing the dynamics of a non-BPSD-brane in superstring theory has an infinitely thin but finite tension kinksolution describing a codimension one BPS D-brane. We study the world-volumetheory of massless modes on the kink, and show that the world volume action hasprecisely the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) form without any higher derivativecorrections. We generalize this to a vortex solution in the effective fieldtheory on a brane-antibrane pair. As in the case of the kink, the vortex isinfinitely thin, has finite energy density, and the world-volume action on thevortex is again given exactly by the DBI action on a BPS D-brane. We alsodiscuss the coupling of fermions and restoration of supersymmetry and$\kappa$-symmetry on the world-volume of the kink. Absence of higher derivativecorrections to the DBI action on the soliton implies that all such correctionsare related to higher derivative corrections to the original effective actionon the world-volume of a non-BPS D-brane or brane-antibrane pair.
