String Theory, Leuven 2002We give an introduction to a new approach to the covariant quantization ofsuperstrings. After a brief review of the classical Green--Schwarz superstringand Berkovits' approach to its quantization based on pure spinors, we discussour covariant formulation without pure spinor constraints. We discuss therelation between the concept of grading, which we introduced to define vertexoperators, and homological perturbation theory, and we compare our work withrecent work by others. In the appendices, we include some background materialfor the Green-Schwarz and Berkovits formulations, in order that thispresentation be self contained.
