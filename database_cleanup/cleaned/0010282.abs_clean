We consider compactifications of ${\cal M}$-theory to four-dimensionalMinkowski space on seven-dimensional non-compact manifolds. Thesecompactifications include a warp factor which is non-constant due to thepresence of sources coming from fivebranes wrapping two-dimensionalsubmanifolds of the internal seven-dimensional space. We derive the expressionfor the field strengths and consider an explicit example of this general classof solutions.
