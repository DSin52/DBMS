We employ the conformal bootstrap to re-examine the problem of finding thecritical behavior of four-Fermion theory at its strong coupling fixed point.Existence of a solution of the bootstrap equations indicates self-consistencyof the assumption that, in space-time dimensions less than four, therenormalization group flow of the coupling constant of a four-Fermioninteraction has a nontrivial fixed point which is generally out of theperturbative regime. We exploit the hypothesis of conformal invariance at thisfixed point to reduce the set of the Schwinger-Dyson bootstrap equations forfour-Fermion theory to three equations which determine the scale dimension ofthe Fermion field $\psi$, the scale dimension of the composite field$\bar{\psi}\psi$ and the critical value of the Yukawa coupling constant. Wesolve the equations assuming this critical value to be small. We show that thissolution recovers the fixed point for the four-fermion interaction with$N$-component fermions in the limit of large $N$ at (Euclidean) dimensions $d$between two and four. We perform a detailed analysis of the $1/N$-expansion in$d=3$ and demonstrate full agreement with the conformal bootstrap. We arguethat this is a useful starting point for more sophisticated computations of thecritical indices.
