Title: Noncommutative Burgers Equation

Authors: Masashi Hamanaka and Kouichi Toda

Comments: 15 pages, LaTeX

We discuss the Burgers equation and the exact solutions on (1+1)-dimensionalnoncommutative spaces. We obtain the noncommutative version of the Burgersequation which possesses the Lax representation by the Lax-pair generatingtechnique and succeed in the linearization of it by noncommutative version ofthe Cole-Hopf transformations. We find the simple solutions of the linearizedequation exactly and discuss more general solutions by the Weyl transformation.We also present the noncommutative Burgers hierarchy.
