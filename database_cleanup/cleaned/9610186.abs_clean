A generalized action for strings which is a sum of the Nambu-Goto and theextrinsic curvature (the energy integral of the surface) terms, is used tocouple strings to gravity. It is shown that the conical singularity has deficitangle that has contributions from both the above terms. It is found that theeffect of extrinsic curvature is to oppose that of the N-G action for thetemperature of the black-hole and to modify the entropy-area relation.
