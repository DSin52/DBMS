We argue that two four-dimensional strongly coupled superconformal fieldtheories, on the Higgs branch in certain large N limits, become respectively(2,0) theory and (1,1) little string theory in six dimensions. We identify thespectrum of states responsible for the generation of the two extra dimensionsand string winding modes. We establish the equivalence using orbifoldrealizations of the field theories and exploiting string dualities. We alsospeculate on deconstructions of M-theory.
