have forgotten to include into the old oneThe relationship between the quasi-exactly solvable problems and W-algebrasis revealed. This relationship enabled one to formulate a new general methodfor building multi-dimensional and multi-channel exactly and quasi-exactlysolvable models with hermitian hamiltonians. The method is based on the use ofmulti-parameter spectral differential equations constructable from generatorsof finite-dimensional representations of simple Lie algebras and fromgenerators of the associated W-algebras. It is shown that algebras B(n),C(n+1), D(2n+2) with n>1 and also algebras A(1), G(2), F(4), E(7) and E(8)always lead to models with hermitian hamiltonians. The situation with theremaining algebras A(n), D(2n+3) with n>1 and E(6) is still unclear.
