Title: Non-Critical Strings in Robertson-Walker Space Time

Authors: K. Behrndt

Comments: 9 pages

I consider a D+1 dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ model based on a possibleinterpretation of the Liouville field as a physical time. The Weyl invarianceof this theory gives us restrictions for the background fields and theparameters of the theory, e.g.\ for trivial background one obtains the knownregions for the dimension of the space-time ($\leq$1 or $\geq$25). For aRobertson-Walker space time a special solution of these equations is discussed.
