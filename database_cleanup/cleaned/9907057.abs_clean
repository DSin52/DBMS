Gauged WZNW models are integrable conformal field theories. We integrate theclassical \slu{} theory with periodic boundary conditions, which describesclosed strings moving in a curved target-space geometry. We calculate itsPoisson bracket structure by solving an initial state problem. The resultsdiffer from previous field-theoretic calculations due to zero modes. For afuture exact canonical quantization the physical fields are (non-locally)transformed onto canonical free fields.
