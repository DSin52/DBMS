We obtain exact expressions for the quasi-normal modes of various spin forthe BTZ black hole. These modes determine the relaxation time of black holeperturbations. Exact agreement is found between the quasi-normal frequenciesand the location of the poles of the retarded correlation function of thecorresponding perturbations in the dual conformal field theory. This thenprovides a new quantitative test of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
