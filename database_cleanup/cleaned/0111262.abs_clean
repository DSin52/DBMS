We examine the structure of the Clifford algebra associated with a Hermitianbilinear form and apply the result to a dynamical model of the relativisticpoint particle. The dynamics of the particle is described by a Dirac spinorwith components in a Clifford algebra. This spinor determines, through theClifford algebra, both the space-time coordinates and their conjugate momentaand satisfies a first order equation of motion which leads to the usualspace-time canonical equations of motion. The constraints appear as theequations of motion for the einbein and spin connection which are needed toensure the reparametrization invariance and local Lorentz invariance of theaction.
