A long-standing problem in string phenomenology has been the fact that thestring unification scale disagrees with the GUT scale obtained by extrapolatinglow-energy data within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standardmodel (MSSM). In this paper we examine several effects that may modify theminimal string predictions and thereby bring string-scale unification intoagreement with low-energy data. These include heavy string thresholdcorrections, non-standard hypercharge normalizations, light SUSY thresholds,intermediate gauge structure, and thresholds arising from extra matter beyondthe MSSM. We explicitly evaluate these contributions within a variety ofrealistic free-fermionic string models, including the flipped SU(5), SO(6) xSO(4), and various SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) models, and find that most of thesesources do not substantially alter the minimal string predictions. Indeed, wefind that the only way to reconcile string unification with low-energy data isthrough certain types of extra matter. Remarkably, however, many of therealistic string models contain precisely this required matter in theirlow-energy spectra.
