We consider the extended superconformal algebras of the Knizhnik-Bershadskytype with $W$-algebra like composite operators occurring in the commutationrelations, but with generators of conformal dimension 1,$\frac{3}{2}$ and 2,only. These have recently been neatly classified by several groups, and weemphasize the classification based on hamiltonian reduction of affine Liesuperalgebras with even subalgebras $G\oplus sl(2)$. We reveiw the situationand improve on previous formulations by presenting generic and very compactexpressions valid for all algebras, classical and quantum. Similarly genericand compact free field realizations are presented as are correspondingscreening charges. Based on these a discussion of singular vectors ispresented. (Based on talk by J.L.
