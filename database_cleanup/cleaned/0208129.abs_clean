Title: Complex field as inflaton and quintessence

Authors: A.V. Yurov

Comments: 7 pages

We investigate cosmology with complex scalar field. It is shown that suchmodels can describe two stages of inflation and the oscillatory regime. Thus wedon't need both quintessence and $\Lambda$-term. It is enough to have singlecomplex field to obtain both inflation and present accelerated universe. If thepresent accelerated expansion was created by the complex field then universemust escape eternal acceleration. Besides, we will show that cosmologicalequations with complex field admit stationary solution without any cosmologicalconstant.
