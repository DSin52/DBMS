We study the effect of nonzero temperature on the induced electric chargearound a Dirac monopole. While at zero temperature the charge is known to beproportional to a CP violating $\theta$ parameter, we find that at hightemperature the charge is proportional to sin $\theta$. Other features of thecharge at nonzero temperature are discussed. We also compute the induced chargeat nonzero temperature around an Aharonov-Bohm flux string in $2+1$ dimensionsand compare the result with an index theorem, and also with theelectron-monopole problem in $3+1$ dimensions.
