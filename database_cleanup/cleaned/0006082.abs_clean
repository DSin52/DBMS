A relativistic two-body wave equation, local in configuration space, isderived from the Bethe-Salpeter equation for two scalar particles bound by ascalar Coulomb interaction. The two-body bound-state wave equation is solvedanalytically, giving a two-body Bohr-Sommerfeld formula whose energies agreewith the Bethe-Salpeter equation to order alpha^4 for all quantum states. Fromthe Bohr-Sommerfeld formula, along with the expectation values of two remainingsmall corrections, the energy levels of the scalar Coulomb Bethe-Salpeterequation are worked out to order alpha^6 for all states.
