A five-dimensional Chern-Simons gravity theory based on the anti-de Sittergroup SO(4,2) is argued to be a useful model in which to understand the detailsof holography and the relationship between generally covariant and dual localquantum field theories. Defined on a manifold with boundary, conformal geometryarises naturally as a gauge invariance preserving boundary condition. Bymatching thermodynamic quantities for a particular background geometry, thedimensionless coupling constant of the Chern-Simons theory is directly relatedto the number of fields in a putative dual theory at high temperature. As aconsistency check, the semiclassical factorization of Wilson line observablesin the gravity theory is shown to induce a factorization in dual theoryobservables as expected by general arguments of large N gauge theory.
