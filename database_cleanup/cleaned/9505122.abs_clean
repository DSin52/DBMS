Based on the dispersionless KP (dKP) theory, we give a comprehensive study ofthe topological Landau-Ginzburg (LG) theory characterized by a rationalpotential. Writing the dKP hierarchy in a general form, we find that thehierarchy naturally includes the dispersionless (continuous) limit of Todahierarchy and its generalizations having finite number of primaries. Severalflat solutions of the topological LG theory are obtained in this formulation,and are identified with those discussed by Dubrovin. We explicitly constructgravitational descendants for all the primary fields. Giving a residue formulafor the 3-point functions of the fields, we show that these 3-point functionssatisfy the topological recursion relation. The string equation is obtained asthe generalized hodograph solutions of the dKP hierarchy, which show that allthe gravitational effects to the constitutive equations (2-point functions) canbe renormalized into the coupling constants in the small phase space.
