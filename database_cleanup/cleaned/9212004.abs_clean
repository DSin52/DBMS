We discuss various aspects of the calculation of correlation functions inconformal theories coupled to quantized 2-dimensional gravity. The mainemphasis lies on the construction of a continuation in the number of insertionsof the cosmological constant operator for $arbitrary$ dimension of the targetspace. Following closely our paper \cite{DO2} we add a more extendedintroduction and discussion of the peculiarities in 1-dimensional target spaceas well as some further remarks about the 4-point function.
