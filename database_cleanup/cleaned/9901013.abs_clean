On the basis of the principle of relativity of observations and theinvariance of the action quantum derived the Nelson's stochastic mechanics andquantum mechanics. It is shown that the canonical group and Hamiltoniandynamics represented the transformations of nonperturbing devices and theunitary group of quantum mechanics represented the transformations of systemsof perturbing devices. Quantum mechanics considered as correct description ofthe stochasticity of real space-time.
