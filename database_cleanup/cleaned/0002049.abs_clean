The finite temperature Casimir free energy is calculated for a dielectricball of radius $a$ embedded in an infinite medium. The condition$\epsilon\mu=1$ is assumed for the inside/outside regions. Both the Greenfunction method and the mode summation method are considered, and found to beequivalent. For a dilute medium we find, assuming a simple "square" dispersionrelation with an abrupt cutoff at imaginary frequency $\hat \omega= \omega_0$,the high temperature Casimir free energy to be negative and proportional to$x_0 \equiv \omega_0 a$. Also, a physically more realistic dispersion relationinvolving spatial dispersion is considered, and is shown to lead to comparableresults.
