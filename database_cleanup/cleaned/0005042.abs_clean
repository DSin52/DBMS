Title: Supersymmetry in Singular Quantum Mechanics

Authors: Ashok Das

Comments: Talk presented at the Second School on Field Theory and Gravitation

in Vitoria, to be published in the proceedingsThe breaking of supersymmetry due to singular potentials in supersymmetricquantum mechanics is critically analyzed. It is shown that, when properlyregularized, these potentials respect supersymmetry, even when theregularization parameter is removed.
