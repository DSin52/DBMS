Authors: J. Kluson

Comments: 23 pages, Revised paper, new proofs of the properties of BRST

operator included, relation with cubic string field theory discussed,reference addedIn this short note we would like to show the relation between the cubicstring field theory for N D-instantons and the string field theory in thepresence of the background B field.
