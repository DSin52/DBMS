The Blau-Thompson N_T=2, D=3 nonequivariant topological model is extended toa N_T=4, D=3 topological theory. The latter, formally, may be regarded as atopological deformation of the N_T=2, D=4 Yamrom-Vafa-Witten theory afterdimensional reduction to D=3. For completeness, also the dimensional reductionof the half-twisted N_T=2, D=4 Yamron model is explicitly constructed.
