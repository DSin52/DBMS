Title: Fractal distribution function and fractal-deformed Heisenberg algebras

Authors: Wellington da Cruz

Comments: 7pages, latex, typos corrected

We consider the concept of fractons, i.e. particles or quasiparticles whichobey specific fractal distribution function and for each universal class h ofparticles we obtain a fractal-deformed Heisenberg algebra. This one takes intoaccount the braid group structure of these objects which live intwo-dimensional multiply connected space.
