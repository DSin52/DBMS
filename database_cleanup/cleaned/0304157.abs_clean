(Nagoya, Nov. 2002) and at Institute of Physics Meeting (London, Feb. 2003)The role non-Abelian magnetic monopoles play in the dynamics of confinementis discussed by examining carefully a class of supersymmetric gauge theories astheoretical laboratories. In particular, in the so-called $r$-vacua of softlybroken ${N}=2$ supersymmmetric $SU(n_c)$ QCD, the Goddard-Olive-Nuyts-Weinbergmonopoles appear as the dominant low-energy effective degrees of freedom. Evenmore interesting is the physics of confining vacua which are deformations ofnontrivial superconformal theories. We argue that in such cases, occurring inthe $r= {n_f \over 2}$ vacua of $SU(n_c)$ theories or in all of confining vacuaof $USp(2n_c)$ or $SO(n_f)$ theories with massless flavors, a new mechanism ofconfinement involving strongly interacting non-Abelian magnetic monopoles is atwork.
