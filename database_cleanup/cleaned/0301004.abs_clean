We derive recurrence relations between phase space expressions in differentdimensions by confining some of the coordinates to tori or spheres of radius$R$ and taking the limit as $R \to \infty$. These relations take the form ofmass integrals, associated with extraneous momenta (relative to the lowerdimension), and produce the result in the higher dimension.
