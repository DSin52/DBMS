The oscillations of photon distribution function for squeezed and correlatedlight are shown to decrease when the temperature increases.The influence of thesqueezing parameter and photon quadrature correlation coefficient on the photondistribution oscillations at nonzero temperatures is studied. The connection ofdeformation of Planck distribution formula with oscillations of distributionfor squeezed and correlated light is discussed.
