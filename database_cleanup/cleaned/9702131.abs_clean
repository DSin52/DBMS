We calculate the first order maximal acceleration corrections to theclassical electrodynamics of a particle in external electromagnetic fields.These include additional dissipation terms, the presence of a critical electricfield, a correction to the cyclotron frequency of an electron in a constantmagnetic field and the power radiated by the particle. The electric effects aresizeble at the fields that are considered attainable with ultrashort $TW$ laserpulses on plasmas.
