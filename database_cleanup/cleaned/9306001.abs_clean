Integral and differential mass formulae of 4-dimensional stationary andaxisymmetric Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton systems are derived. The total mass(energy) of these systems are expressed in terms of other physical quantitiessuch as electric charge of the black hole suitably modified due to theexistence of the dilaton field. It is shown that when we vary slightly thefields (metric of the spacetime $g_{\mu\nu}$, $U(1)-$gauge potential $A_{\mu}$,and dilaton $\phi$) in such a way as they obey classical equations of motion,the variation of the dilaton does not contribute explicitly to the variation ofthe total mass, but contributes only through the variation of the electriccharge of the black hole.
