We consider the spectra of excitations around diagonal and intersectingD-brane configurations on tori. These configurations are described by constantcurvature connections in a dual gauge theory description. The low-energy stringfluctuation spectrum is reproduced exactly by the gauge theory in the case ofvanishing field strength; however, this correspondence breaks down for fixednonzero field strength. We show that in many cases the full Born-Infeld actioncorrectly captures the low-energy spectrum in the case of non-vanishing fieldstrength. This gives a field theory description of the low-energy physics ofsystems of diagonally wound branes and branes at angles as considered byBerkooz, Douglas and Leigh. This description extends naturally tonon-supersymmetric configurations, where the tachyonic instability associatedwith brane-anti-brane systems appears as an instability around a saddle pointsolution of the corresponding Yang-Mills/Born-Infeld theory. In some cases, thefield theory description requires a non-abelian generalization of theBorn-Infeld action. We follow Tseytlin's recent proposal for formulating suchan action. In the case of intersecting branes, the non-abelian Born-Infeldtheory produces a transcendental relation which comes tantalizingly close toreproducing the correct spectrum; however, a discrepancy remains whichindicates that a further clarification of the non-abelian Born-Infeld actionmay be necessary.
