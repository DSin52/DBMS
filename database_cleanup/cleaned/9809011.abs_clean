In the light of $\phi $--mapping method and topological current theory, thetopological structure and the topological quantization of arbitrary dimensionaltopological defects are investigated. It is pointed out that the topologicalquantum numbers of the defects are described by the Winding numbers of $\phi$--mapping which are determined in terms of the Hopf indices and the Brouwerdegrees of $\phi$--mapping. Furthermore, it is shown that all the topologicaldefects are generated from where $\vec \phi =0$, i.e. from the zero points ofthe $\phi $--mapping.
