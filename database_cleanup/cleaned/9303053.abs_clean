The high-energy Regge behavior of gauge theories is studied via the formalismof Analytic Multi-Regge Theory. Perturbative results for spontaneously-brokentheories are first organised into reggeon diagrams. Unbroken gauge theories arestudied via a reggeon diagram infra-red analysis of symmetry restoration.Massless fermions play a crucial role and the case of QCD involves theSuper-Critical Pomeron as an essential intermediate stage. An introductoryreview of the build up of transverse momentum diagrams and reggeon diagramsfrom leading log calculations in gauge theories is presented first. It is thenshown that the results closely reproduce the general structure for multi-reggeamplitudes derived in Part I of the article, allowing the construction ofgeneral reggeon diagrams for spontaneously-broken theories. Next it is arguedthat, with a transverse-momentum cut-off, unbroken gauge theories can bereached through an infra-red limiting process which successively decouplesfundamental representation Higgs fields . The first infra-red limit studied isthe restoration of SU(2) gauge symmetry. The analysis is dominated by theexponentiation of divergences imposed by Reggeon Unitarity and the contributionof massless quarks ...
