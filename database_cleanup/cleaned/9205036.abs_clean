Title: Solitons with integer fermion number

Authors: Alfred S. Goldhaber

Comments: 12 pages

Necessary and sufficient conditions are found for any object in $3+1$dimensions to have integer rather than fractional fermion number. Nontrivialexamples include the Jackiw-Rebbi monopole and the already well studiedSu-Schrieffer-Heeger soliton, both displaying integer multiples of elementarycharges in combinations that normally are forbidden.
