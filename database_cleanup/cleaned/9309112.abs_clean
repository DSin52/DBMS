Title: Strongly Coupled Quantum and Classical Systems and Zeno's Effect

Authors: Ph. Blanchard and A. Jadczyk

Comments: 9 pages

A model interaction between a two-state quantum system and a classicalswitching device is analysed and shown to lead to the quantum Zeno effect forlarge values of the coupling constant k . A minimal piecewise deterministicrandom process compatible with the Liouville equation is described, and it isshown that 1/k can be interpreted as the jump frequency of the classical device
