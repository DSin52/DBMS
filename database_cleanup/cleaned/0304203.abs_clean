Title: CMB Power Spectrum from Noncommutative Spacetime

Authors: Qing-Guo Huang and Miao Li

Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures

Very recent CMB data of WMAP offers an opportunity to test inflation models,in particular, the running of spectral index is quite new and can be used torule out some models. We show that an noncommutative spacetime inflation modelgives a good explanation of these new results. In fitting the data, we alsoobtain a relationship between the noncommutative parameter (string scale) andthe ending time of inflation.
