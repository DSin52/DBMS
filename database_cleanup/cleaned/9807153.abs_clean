In this paper we develop a general method for constructing 3-point functionsin conformal field theory with affine Lie group symmetry, continuing our recentwork on 2-point functions. The results are provided in terms of triangularcoordinates used in a wave function description of vectors in highest weightmodules. In this framework, complicated couplings translate into ordinaryproducts of certain elementary polynomials. The discussions pertain to allsimple Lie groups and arbitrary integrable representation. An interestingby-product is a general procedure for computing tensor product coefficients,essentially by counting integer solutions to certain inequalities. As anillustration of the construction, we consider in great detail the three casesSL(3), SL(4) and SO(5).
