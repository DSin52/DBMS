The possibility of excitations with fractional spin and statististics in$1+1$ dimensions is explored. The configuration space of a two-particle systemis the half-line. This makes the Hamiltonian self-adjoint for a family ofboundary conditions parametrized by one real number $\gamma$. The limit $\gamma\rightarrow 0, (\infty$) reproduces the propagator of non-relativisticparticles whose wavefunctions are even (odd) under particle exchange. Arelativistic ansatz is also proposed which reproduces the correct Polyakov spinfactor for the spinning particle in $1+1$ dimensions. These checks supportvalidity of the interpretation of $\gamma$ as a parameter related to the``spin'' that interpolates continuously between bosons ($\gamma =0$) andfermions ($\gamma =\infty$). Our approach can thus be useful for obtaining thepropagator for one-dimensional anyons.
