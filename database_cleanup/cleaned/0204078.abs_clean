We present a formulation of a matrix model which manifestly possesses thegeneral coordinate invariance when we identify the large $N$ matrices withdifferential operators. In order to build a matrix model which has the localLorentz invariance, we investigate how the $so(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry and the$u(N)$ gauge symmetry are mixed together. We first analyze the bosonic part ofthe model, and we find that the Einstein gravity is reproduced in the classicallow-energy limit. And we present a proposal to build a matrix model which has${\cal N}=2$ SUSY and reduces to the type IIB supergravity in the classicallow-energy limit.
