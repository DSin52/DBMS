We present a real space renormalization-group map for probabilities of randomwalks on a hierarchical lattice. From this, we study the asymptotic behavior ofthe end-to-end distance of a weakly self- avoiding random walk (SARW) thatpenalizes the (self-)intersection of two random walks in dimension four on thehierarchical lattice.
