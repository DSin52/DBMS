We make a complete pole analysis of the reflection factors of the boundaryscaling Lee-Yang model. In the process we uncover a number of previouslyunremarked mechanisms for the generation of simple poles in boundary reflectionfactors, which have implications for attempts to close the boundary bootstrapin more general models. We also explain how different boundary conditions cansometimes share the same fundamental reflection factor, by relating thephenomenon to potential ambiguities in the interpretation of certain poles. Inthe case discussed, this ambiguity can be lifted by specifying the sign of abulk-boundary coupling. While the recipe we employ for the association of poleswith general on-shell diagrams is empirically correct, we stress that ajustification on the basis of more fundamental principles remains a challengefor future work.
