To investigate the properties of $c=1$ matter coupled to $2$d{--}gravity wehave performed large-scale simulations of two copies of the Ising Model on adynamical lattice. We measure spin susceptibility and percolation criticalexponents using finite-size scaling. We show explicitly how logarithmiccorrections are needed for a proper comparison with theoretical exponents. Wealso exhibit correlations, mediated by gravity, between the energy and magneticproperties of the two Ising species. The prospects for extending this workbeyond $c=1$ are addressed.
