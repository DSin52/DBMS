Renormalization group, and in particular its Quantum Field Theoryimplementation has provided us with essential tools for the description of thephase transitions and critical phenomena beyond mean field theory. We thereforereview the methods, based on renormalized phi^4_3 quantum field theory andrenormalization group, which have led to a precise determination of criticalexponents of the N-vector model (R. Guida and J. Zinn-Justin, J. Phys. A31(1998) 8103. cond-mat/9803240). and of the equation of state of the 3D Isingmodel (R. Guida and J. Zinn-Justin, Nucl. Phys. B489 [FS] (1997) 626,hep-th/9610223.). These results are among the most precise available probingfield theory in a non-perturbative regime.
