Title: Variational Approach to Quantum Field Theory

the Perturbative Expansion around ItAuthors: Jae Hyung Yee (Yonsei Univ.)

Comments: To appear in the proceedings of APCTP-ICTP Joint International

Conference '97 on "Recent Developments in Nonperturbative Quantum FieldTheory". new references are addedThe functional Schrodinger picture formulation of quantum field theory andthe variational Gaussian approximation method based on the formulation arebriefly reviewed. After presenting recent attempts to improve the variationalapproximation, we introduce a new systematic method based on the backgroundfield method, which enables one to compute the order-by-order correction termsto the Gaussian approximation of the effective action.
