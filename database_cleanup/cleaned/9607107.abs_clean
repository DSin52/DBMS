We discuss the known microscopic interpretations of the Bekenstein-Hawkingentropy for configurations of intersecting M-branes. In some cases the entropyscales as that of a massless field theory on the intersection. A differentsituation, found for configurations which reduce to 1-charge D=5 black holes or2-charge D=4 black holes, is explained by a gas of non-critical strings attheir Hagedorn temperature. We further suggest that the entropy ofconfigurations reducing to 1-charge D=4 black holes is due to 3-branes movingwithin 5-branes.
