Comments: 62 pages, 21 figures, lecture delivered at the workshop "Trends in

Theoretical Physics II", Buenos Aires, November 1998A brief review on the progress made in the study of Chern-Simons gauge theorysince its relation to knot theory was discovered ten years ago is presented.Emphasis is made on the analysis of the perturbative study of the theory andits connection to the theory of Vassiliev invariants. It is described how thestudy of the quantum field theory for three different gauge fixings leads tothree different representations for Vassiliev invariants. Two of these gaugecorresponds to the configuration space integrals while the non-covariantlight-cone gauge to the Kontsevich integral. The progress made in the analysisof the third gauge fixing, the non-covariant temporal gauge, is described indetail. In this case one obtains combinatorial expressions, instead of integralones, for Vassiliev invariants. The approach based on this last gauge fixingseems very promising to obtain a full combinatorial formula. We collect thecombinatorial expressions for all the Vassiliev invariants up to order fourwhich have been obtained in this approach.
