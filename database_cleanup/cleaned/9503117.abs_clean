After showing that the magnetic translation operators are not the symmetries ofthe QHE on non-flat surfaces , we show that there exist another set ofoperators which leads to the quantum group symmetries for some of thesesurfaces . As a first example we show that the $su(2)$ symmetry of the QHE onsphere leads to $su_q(2)$ algebra in the equator . We explain this result by acontraction of $su(2)$ . Secondly , with the help of the symmetry operators ofQHE on the Pioncare upper half plane , we will show that the ground state wavefunctions form a representation of the $su_q(2)$ algebra .
