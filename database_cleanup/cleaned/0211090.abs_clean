We derive effective actions for Spacelike branes (S-branes) and find asolution describing the formation of fundamental strings in the rolling tachyonbackground. The S-brane action is a Dirac-Born-Infeld action for Euclideanworldvolumes defined in the context of time-dependent tachyon condensation ofnon-BPS branes. It includes gauge fields and in particular a scalar fieldassociated with translation along the time direction. We show that the BIonspike solutions constructed in this system correspond to the production of aconfined electric flux tube (a fundamental string) at late time of the rollingtachyon.
