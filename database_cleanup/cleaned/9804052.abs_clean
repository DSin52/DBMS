Superalgebras including generators having spins up to two and realisable astangent vector fields on Lorentz covariant generalised superspaces areconsidered. The latter have a representation content reminiscent ofconfiguration spaces of (super)gravity theories. The most general canonicalsupercommutation relations for the corresponding phase space coordinatesallowed by Lorentz covariance are discussed. By including generatorstransforming according to every Lorentz representation having spin up to two,we obtain, from the super Jacobi identities, the complete set of quadraticequations for the Lorentz covariant structure constants. These definingequations for spin two Heisenberg superalgebras are highly overdetermined.Nevertheless, non-trivial solutions can indeed be found. By making somesimplifying assumptions, we explicitly construct several classes of thesesuperalgebras.
