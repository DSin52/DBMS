Title: New physics in the charged relativistic Bose gas using zeta-function

regularization?Authors: Antonio Filippi

Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX. Talk given at the ``SEWM2000 - Strong and

Electro-Weak Matter 2000''Conference, June 2000, Marseilles, France.Proceedings to be published by World ScientificThe multiplicative anomaly, recently introduced in QFT, plays a fundamentalrole in solving some mathematical inconsistencies of the widely usedzeta-function regularization method. Its physical relevance is still an openquestion and is here analyzed in the light of a non-perturbative method. Evenin this approach the ``different physics'' seems to hold and not to be easilyremovable by renormalization.
