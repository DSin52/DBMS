The increasing precision of many experiments in elementary particle physicsleads to continuing interest in perturbative higher order calculations in theelectroweak Standard Model or extensions of it. Such calculations are ofincreasing complexity because more loops and/or more legs are considered.Correspondingly efficient computational methods are mandatory for manycalculations. One problem which affects the feasibility of higher ordercalculations is the problem with gamma(5) in dimensional regularization. Sincethe subject thirty years after its invention is still controversial I advocatehere some ideas which seem not to be common knowledge but might shed some newlight on the problem. I present arguments in favor of utilizing ananticommuting gamma(5) and a simple 4-dimensional treatment of the hardanomalies.
