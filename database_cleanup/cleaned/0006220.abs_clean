The zero-point energy of a conducting spherical shell is studied by imposingthe axial gauge via path-integral methods, with boundary conditions on theelectromagnetic potential and ghost fields. The coupled modes are then found tobe the temporal and longitudinal modes for the Maxwell field. The resultingsystem can be decoupled by studying a fourth-order differential equation withboundary conditions on longitudinal modes and their second derivatives. Theexact solution of such equation is found by using a Green-function method, andis obtained from Bessel functions and definite integrals involving Besselfunctions. Complete agreement with a previous path-integral analysis in theLorenz gauge, and with Boyer's value, is proved in detail.
