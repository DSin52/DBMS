We give the description of discretized moduli spaces (d.m.s.) $\Mcdisc$introduced in \cite{Ch1} in terms of a discrete de Rham cohomologies for eachmoduli space $\Mgn$ of a genus $g$, $n$ being the number of punctures. Wedemonstrate that intersection indices (cohomological classes) calculated ford.m.s. coincide with the ones for the continuum moduli space $\Mc$ compactifiedby Deligne and Mumford procedure. To show it we use a matrix model technique.The Kontsevich matrix model is a generating function for these indices in thecontinuum case, and the matrix model with the potential $N\alpha \tr {\bigl(-\fr 12 \L X\L X +\log (1-X)+X\bigr)}$ is the one for d.m.s. In the last casethe effects of reductions become relevant, but we use the stratificationprocedure in order to express integrals over open spaces $\Mdisc$ in terms ofintersection indices which are to be calculated on compactified spaces. Thecoincidence of the cohomological classes for both continuum and d.m.s. modelsenables us to propose the existence of a quantum group structure on d.m.s. Thend.m.s. are nothing but cyclic (exceptional) representations of a quantum grouprelated to a moduli space $\Mc$. Considering the explicit expressions forintegrals of Chern classes over $\Mc$ and $\Mcdisc$ we conjecture that eachmoduli space $\Mc$ in the Kontsevich parametrization can be presented as acoset $\Mc ={\bf T}^d/G$, $d=3g-3+n$, where ${\bf T}^d$ is some$d$--dimensional complex torus and $G$ is a finite order symmetry group of${\bf T}^d$.
