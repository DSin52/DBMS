We approximate analytically the semi-classical differential cross-section forlow-energy solitonic BPS SU(2) magnetic monopoles using the geodesicapproximation. The semi-classical scattering amplitude, f(\theta), can beexpressed as a conditionally convergent infinite series which is madeabsolutely convergent by analytic continuation of the generalised zetafunction. Our results suggest that the classical solitonic cross-sectionare in good agreement over a wide range of scattering angles,\pi/3<\theta<\pi/2 and \pi/2<\theta<2\pi/3.
