The fields of the conjectured ``heterotic" super--fivebrane sigma--model inten dimensions are made out of a well known gravitational sector, the $X$ andthe $\vartheta$, and of a still unknown heterotic sector which should becoupled to the Yang--Mills fields. We compute the one--loop $d=6$ worldvolumeand $D=10$ target space Lorentz--anomalies which arise from the gravitationalsector of the heterotic super--fivebrane sigma--model, using a method which wedeveloped previously for the Green--Schwarz heterotic superstring. Theseanomalies turn out to carry an overall coefficient which is $1/2$ of thatrequired by the string/fivebrane duality conjecture. As a consequence theworldvolume anomaly vanishes if the heterotic fields consist of 16 (rather than32) complex Weyl fermions on the worldvolume. This implies that thestring/fivebrane duality conjecture can not be based on a ``heterotic"super--fivebrane sigma--model with only fermions in the heterotic sector.Possible implications of this result are discussed.
