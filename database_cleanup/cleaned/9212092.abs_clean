Chiral/self-dual restrictions of various super Yang-Mills and supergravitytheories in (2,2) dimensions are described. These include the N=1 supergravitywith a cosmological term and the N=1 new minimal supergravity theory. In thelatter case, a self-duality condition on a torsionful Riemann curvature ispossible, and it implies the equations of motion that follow from an $R^2$ typesupergravity action.
