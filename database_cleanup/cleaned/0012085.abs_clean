It is shown that two$(1 + 1)$-dimensional (2D) free Abelian- andself-interacting non-Abelian gauge theories (without any interaction withmatter fields) belong to a new class of topological field theories. These newtheories capture together some of the key features of Witten- and Schwarz typeof topological field theories because they are endowed with symmetries that arereminiscent of the Schwarz type theories but their Lagrangian density has theappearance of the Witten type theories. The topological invariants for thesetheories are computed on a 2D compact manifold and their recursion relationsare obtained. These new theories are shown to provide a class of tractablefield theoretical models for the Hodge theory in two dimensions of flat(Minkowski) spacetime where there are no propagating degrees of freedomassociated with the 2D gauge boson.
