Title: Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics and Noncommutative Dynamics

Comments: Plain Tex, 7 pages, no figures

In this talk I shall first make some brief remarks on quaternionic quantummechanics, and then describe recent work with A.C. Millard in which we showthat standard complex quantum field theory can arise as the statisticalmechanics of an underlying noncommutative dynamics.
