In previous work on the quantum Hall effect on an annulus, we used$O(d,d;{\bf Z})$ duality transformations on the action describing edgeexcitations to generate the Haldane hierarchy of Hall conductivities. Here wegenerate the corresponding hierarchy of ``bulk actions'' which are associatedwith Chern-Simons (CS) theories, the connection between the bulk and edgearising from the requirement of anomaly cancellation. We also find a dualitytransformation for the CS theory exactly analogous to the $R\rightarrow\frac{1}{R}$ duality of the scalar field theory at the edge.
