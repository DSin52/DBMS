Following a self-contained review of the basics of the theory of cosmologicalperturbations, we discuss why the conclusions reached in the recent paper byKaloper et al are too pessimistic estimates of the amplitude ofpossible imprints of trans-Planckian (string) physics on the spectrum of cosmicmicrowave anisotropies in an inflationary Universe. It is shown that the likelyorigin of large trans-Planckian effects on late time cosmological fluctuationscomes from nonadiabatic evolution of the state of fluctuations while thewavelength is smaller than the Planck (string) scale, resulting in an excitedstate at the time that the wavelength crosses the Hubble radius duringinflation.
