We consider duality transformations in N=2, d=4 Yang--Mills theory coupled toN=2 supergravity. A symplectic and coordinate covariant framework isestablished, which allows one to discuss stringy `classical and quantum dualitysymmetries' (monodromies), incorporating T and S dualities. In particular, weshall be able to study theories (like N=2 heterotic strings) which areformulated in symplectic basis where a `holomorphic prepotential' F does notexist, and yet give general expressions for all relevant physical quantities.Duality transformations and symmetries for the N=1 matter coupled Yang--Millssupergravity system are also exhibited. The implications of duality symmetry onall N>2 extended supergravities are briefly mentioned. We finally give thegeneral form of the central charge and the N=2 semiclassical spectrum of thedyonic BPS saturated states (as it comes by truncation of the N=4 spectrum).
