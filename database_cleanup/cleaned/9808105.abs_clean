"Continuous Advances in QCD", Minneapolis, 16-19 April, 1998Complex monopole solutions exist in the three dimensional Georgi-Glashowmodel with the Chern-Simons term. They dominate the path integral and disorderthe Higgs vacuum. Gribov copies of the vacuum and monopole configurations arestudied in detail.
