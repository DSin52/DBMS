Workshop on Mathematical and Physical Aspects of Nonlinear Field Theories,Seoul, Korea, February 1998Magnetic monopole solutions naturally arise in the context of spontaneouslybroken gauge theories. When the unbroken symmetry includes a non-Abeliansubgroup, investigation of the low-energy monopole dynamics by means of themoduli space approximation reveals degrees of freedom that can be attributed tomassless monopoles. These do not correspond to distinct solitons, but insteadare manifested as a cloud of non-Abelian field surrounding one or more massivemonopoles. In these talks I explain how one is led to these solutions and thendescribe them in some detail.
