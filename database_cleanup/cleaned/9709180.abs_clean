Title: Duality in Quantum Field Theory (and String Theory)

Authors: Luis Alvarez-Gaume and Frederic Zamora

Comments: 38 pages, 7 figures, LaTeX, revtex, two references added. Based on a

lectures delivered by L. A.-G. at `The Workshop on Fundamental Particles andInteractions', held in Vanderbilt University, and CERN-La Plata-Santiago deCompostela School of Physics, both in May 1997These lectures give an introduction to duality in Quantum Field Theory. Wediscuss the phases of gauge theories and the implications of theelectric-magnetic duality transformation to describe the mechanism ofconfinement. We review the exact results of N=1 supersymmetric QCD and theSeiberg-Witten solution of N=2 super Yang-Mills. Some of its extensions toString Theory are also briefly discussed.
