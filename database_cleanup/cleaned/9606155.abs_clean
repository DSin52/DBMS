A new method for non-perturbative calculation of Green functions in quantummechanics and quantum field theory is proposed. The method is based on anapproximation of Schwinger-Dyson equation for the generating functional byexactly soluble equation in functional derivatives. Equations of the leadingapproximation and the first step are solved for $\phi^4_d$-model. At $d=1$(anharmonic oscillator) the ground state energy is calculated. Therenormalization program is performed for the field theory at $d=2,3$. At $d=4$the renormalization of the coupling involves a trivialization of the theory.
