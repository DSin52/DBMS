We examine a class of gauge theories obtained by projecting out certainfields from an N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory. These theories arenon-supersymmetric and in the large N limit are known to be conformal. Recentlyit was proposed that the hierarchy problem could be solved by embedding thestandard model in a theory of this kind with finite N. In order to check thisclaim one must find the conformal points of the theory. To do this we calculatethe one-loop beta functions for the Yukawa and quartic scalar couplings. Wefind that with the beta functions set to zero the one-loop quadraticdivergences are not canceled at sub-leading order in N; thus the hierarchybetween the weak scale and the Planck scale is not stabilized unless N is ofthe order 10^28 or larger. We also find that at sub-leading orders in Nrenormalization induces new interactions, which were not present in theoriginal Lagrangian.
