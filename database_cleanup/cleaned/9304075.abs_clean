It is shown that the generalized (with nonpolynomial Lagrangian) Chern-Simonsmembranes and in general $p$-branes moving in $D$-dimensional target spaceadmit an infinite set of secondary constraints. With respect to the Poissonbracket these constraints satisfy closed algebra containing $p$-dimensionalclassical $W$ algebra as a subalgebra. In the case when the target spacedimension $D$ is finite the theory is topological.
