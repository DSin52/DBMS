An ADM mass formula is derived for a wide class of black solutions withcertain spherical symmetry. By applying this formula, we calculate the ADMmasses for recently discovered black strings and $p$-branes in diversedimensions. By this, the Bogolmol'nyi equation can be shown to hold explicitly.A useful observation is made for non-extremal black $p$-branes that only for $p= 0$, i.e. for a black hole, can its ADM mass be read directly from theasymptotic behaviour of the metric component $g_{00}$.
