Explicit divergences and counterterms do not appear in the differentialrenormalization method, but they are concealed in the neglected surface termsin the formal partial integration procedure used. A systematic real spacecutoff procedure for massless $\phi^4$ theory is therefore studied in order totest the method and its compatibility with unitarity. Through 3-loop order, itis found that cutoff bare amplitudes are equal to the renormalized amplitudespreviously obtained using the formal procedure plus singular terms which can beconsistently cancelled by adding conventional counterterms to the Lagrangian.Renormalization group functions $\beta (g)$ and $\gamma (g)$ obtained in thecutoff theory also agree with previous results.
