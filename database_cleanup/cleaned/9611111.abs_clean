We comment on the structure of intersecting black p-brane solutions in stringtheory explaining how known solutions can be obtained from Schwarzschildsolution simply by sequences of boosts and dualities. This implies, inparticular, that dimensional reduction in all internal world-volume directionsincluding time leads to a metric (related by analytic continuation to acosmological metric) which does not depend on p-brane charges, i.e. is the sameas the metric following by reduction from a higher-dimensional `neutral'Schwarzschild black hole.
