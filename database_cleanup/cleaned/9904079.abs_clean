A generalization of scalar electrodynamics called fluid electrodynamics ispresented. In this theory a fluid replaces the Higgs scalar field. Fluidelectrodynamics might have application to the theory of low temperature Heliumsuperfluids, but here it is argued that it provides an alternative method ofapproaching symmetry breaking in particle physics. The method of constructingfluid electrodynamics is to start with the velocity decomposition of a perfectfluid as in general relativity. A unit vector tangent to the flow lines of an$V_a=h^{-1}(\ph_a+\al\bt_a-\th S)$. A novel interacting charged fluid can bepotentials. This fluid is no longer isentropic and there are choices for whichit either obeys the second law of thermodynamics or not. A mass term of thecorrect sign occurs for the $A$ term in the stress, and this mass term dependson the potentials in the above vector. The charged fluid can be reduced toscalar electrodynamics and the standard approach to symmetry breaking applied;alternatively a mass can be induced by the fluid by using just thethermodynamic potentials and then fixing at a critical point, if this is takento be the Bose condensation point then the induced mass is negligible.
