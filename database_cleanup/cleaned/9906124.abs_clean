By dimensional reduction of a massive BF theory, a new topological fieldtheory is constructed in (2+1) dimensions. Two different topological terms, oneinvolving a scalar and a Kalb-Ramond fields and another one equivalent to thefour-dimensional BF term, are present. We constructed two actions with thesetopological terms and show that a topological mass generation mechanism can beimplemented. Using the non-Chern-Simons topological term, an action is proposedleading to a classical duality relation between Klein-Gordon and Maxwellactions. We also have shown that an action in (2+1) dimensions with theKalb-Ramond field is related by Buscher's duality transformation to a massivegauge-invariant Stuckelberg-type theory.
