The multi-loop amplitudes for the closed, oriented superstring arerepresented by finite dimensional integrals of explicit functions calculatedthrough the super-Schottky group parameters and interaction vertex coordinateson the supermanifold. The integration region is proposed to be consistent withthe group of the local symmetries of the amplitude and with the unitarityequations. It is shown that, besides the SL(2) group, super-Schottky group andmodular one, the total group of the local symmetries includes an isomorphismbetween sets of the forming group transformations, the period matrix to be thesame. The singular integration configurations are studied. The calculation ofthe integrals over the above configurations is developed preserving all thelocal symmetries of the amplitude, the amplitudes being free from divergences.The nullification of the 0-, 1-, 2- and 3-point amplitudes of massless statesis verified. Vanishing the amplitudes for a longitudinal gauge boson is argued.
