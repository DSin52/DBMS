We examine the evaporation of two--dimensional black holes, the classicalspace--times of which are extended geometries, like for example thetwo--dimensional section of the extremal Reissner--Nordstrom black hole. Wefind that the evaporation in two particular models proceeds to a stableend--point. This should represent the generic behavior of a certain class oftwo--dimensional dilaton--gravity models. There are two distinct regimesdepending on whether the back--reaction is weak or strong in a certain sense.When the back--reaction is weak, evaporation proceeds via an adiabaticevolution, whereas for strong back--reaction, the decay proceeds in a somewhatsurprising manner. Although information loss is inevitable in these models atthe semi--classical level, it is rather benign, in that the information isstored in another asymptotic region.
