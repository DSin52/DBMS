We introduce selfdual Maxwell-Higgs systems with uniform background electriccharge density and show that the selfdual equations satisfied by topologicalvortices can be reduced to the original Bogomol'nyi equations without anybackground. These vortices are shown to carry no spin but to feel the Magnusforce due to the shielding charge carried by the Higgs field. We also study thedynamics of slowly moving vortices and show that the spin-statistics theoremholds to our vortices.
