We study the system of Schwarzschild anti de Sitter (S-AdS) bulk and FRWbrane for localization of gravity; i.e. zero mass gravitons having ground stateon the brane, and thereby recovering the Einstein gravity with high energycorrection. It has been known that gravity is not localized on AdS brane withAdS bulk. We prove the general result that gravity is not localized for dynamicbranes whenever Lambda_4 < 0, and is localized for the curvature index k = 1only when Lambda_4 > 0 and black hole mass M not equal 0, else it is localizedfor all other FRW models. If the localization is taken as the brane worldcompatibility criterion for cosmological models, then it would predict thatnegative cosmological constant on the brane is not sustainable.
