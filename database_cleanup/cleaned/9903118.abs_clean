In this paper, we use only the equation of motion for an interacting systemof gravity, dilaton and antisymmetric tensor to study the soliton solutions bymaking use of a Poincar\'e invariant ansatz. We show that the system ofequations are completly integrable and the solution is unique with appropriateboundary conditions. Some new class of solutions are also given explicitly.
