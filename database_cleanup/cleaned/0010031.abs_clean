Title: Center Vortices in Continuum Yang-Mills Theory

Comments: 13pp, 4figs,Invited talk presented by H. Reinhardt at the

International Conference on Confinement and the Structure of Hadrons inVienna, 3.-8.7.00The properties of center vortices are discussed within continuum Yang-Millstheory. By starting from the lattice theory and carefully performing thecontinuum limit the gauge potential of center vortices is obtained and thecontinuum analog of the maximal center gauge fixing is extracted. It is shown,that the Pontryagin index of center vortices is given by theirself-intersection number, which vanishes unless the center vortices hostmagnetic monpoles, which make the vortex sheets non-oriented.
