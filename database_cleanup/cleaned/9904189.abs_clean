(1997)] Schwinger terms in hamiltonian quantization of chiral fermions coupledto vector potentials were computed, using some ideas from the theory of gerbes,with the help of the family index theorem for a manifold with boundary. Here,we generalize this method to include gravitational Schwinger terms.
