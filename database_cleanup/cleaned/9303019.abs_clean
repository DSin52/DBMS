We consider the conformal properties of geometries described by higher-rankline elements. A crucial role is played by the conformal Killing equation(CKE). We introduce the concept of null-flat spaces in which the line elementcan be written as ${ds}^r=r!d\zeta_1\cdots d\zeta_r$. We then show that, fornull-flat spaces, the critical dimension, for which the CKE has infinitely manysolutions, is equal to the rank of the metric. Therefore, in order to constructan integrable conformal field theory in 4 dimensions we need to rely onfourth-rank geometry. We consider the simple model ${\cal L}={1\over 4}G^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi\partial_\lambda\phi\partial_\rho\phi$ and show that it is an integrable conformal model in 4dimensions. Furthermore, the associated symmetry group is ${Vir}^4$.
