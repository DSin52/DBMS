Title: Fractional branes on ALE orbifolds

Authors: M. Billo', L. Gallot, A. Liccardo

Comments: Latex, 6 pages, to appear in the proceedings of the RTN meeting ``The

Quantum Structure of Spacetime and the Geometric Nature of FundamentalInteractions'', (Corfu, September 2001)We derive the classical type IIB supergravity solution describing fractionalD3-branes transverse to a C^2/Gamma orbifold singularity, for Gamma anyKleinian ADE subgroup. This solution fully describes the N=2 gauge theory withappropriate gauge groups and matter living on the branes, up tonon-perturbative instanton contributions.
