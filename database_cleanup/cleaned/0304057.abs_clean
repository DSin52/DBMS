We consider a blown-up 3-brane, with the resulting geometry R^(3,1) \timesS^(N-1), in an infinite-volume bulk with N > 2 extra dimensions. The action onthe brane includes both an Einstein term and a cosmological constant. Similarsetups have been proposed both to reproduce 4-d gravity on the brane, and tosolve the cosmological constant problem. Here we obtain a singularity-freesolution to Einstein's equations everywhere in the bulk and on the brane, whichallows us to address these question explicitely. One finds, however, that theproper volume of S^(N-1) and the cosmological constant on the brane have to befine-tuned relatively to each other, thus the cosmological constant problem isnot solved. Moreover the scalar propagator on the brane behaves 4-dimensionallyover a phenomenologically acceptable range only if the warp factor on the braneis huge, which aggravates the Weak Scale - Planck Scale hierarchy problem.
