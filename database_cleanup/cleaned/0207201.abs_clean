The bosonic beta-gamma ghost system has long been used in formalconstructions of conformal field theory. It has become important in its ownright in the last few years, as a building block of field theory approaches todisordered systems, and as a simple representative -- due in part to itsunderlying su(2)_{-1/2} structure -- of non-unitary conformal field theories.We provide in this paper the first complete, physical, analysis of thisbeta-gamma system, and uncover a number of striking features. We show inparticular that the spectrum involves an infinite number of fields witharbitrarily large negative dimensions. These fields have their origin in atwisted sector of the theory, and have a direct relationship with spectrallyflowed representations in the underlying su(2)_{-1/2} theory. We discuss thespectral flow in the context of the operator algebra and fusion rules, andprovide a re-interpretation of the modular invariant consistent with thespectrum.
