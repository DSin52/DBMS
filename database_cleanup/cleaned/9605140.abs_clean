We review a class of matrix models whose degrees of freedom are matrices withanticommuting elements. We discuss the properties of the adjoint fermion one-,two- and gauge invariant D-dimensional matrix models at large-N and comparethem with their bosonic counterparts which are the more familiar Hermitianmatrix models. We derive and solve the complete sets of loop equations for thecorrelators of these models and use these equations to examine criticalbehaviour. The topological large-N expansions are also constructed and theirrelation to other aspects of modern string theory such as integrablehierarchies is discussed. We use these connections to discuss the applicationsof these matrix models to string theory and induced gauge theories. We arguethat as such the fermionic matrix models may provide a novel generalization ofthe discretized random surface representation of quantum gravity in which thegenus sum alternates and the sums over genera for correlators have betterconvergence properties than their Hermitian counterparts. We discuss the use ofadjoint fermions instead of adjoint scalars to study induced gauge theories. Wealso discuss two classes of dimensionally reduced models, a fermionic vectormodel and a supersymmetric matrix model, and discuss their applications to thebranched polymer phase of string theories in target space dimensions D>1 andalso to the meander problem.
