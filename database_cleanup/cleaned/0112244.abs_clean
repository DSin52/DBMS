Physics, Sept. 2001, to appear in the proceedingsA simple mechanism for SUSY breaking is proposed due to the coexistence ofBPS domain walls. It requires no messenger fields nor complicated SUSY breakingsector on any of the walls. We assumed that our world is on a BPS domain walland that the other BPS wall breaks the SUSY preserved by our wall. We obtain an${\cal N}=1$ model in four dimensions which admits an exact solution of astable non-BPS configuration of two walls. The stability is assured by atopological quantum number associated with the winding on the field space ofthe topology of $S^1$. We propose that the overlap of the wave functions of theNambu-Goldstone fermion and those of physical fields provides a practicalmethod to evaluate SUSY breaking mass splitting on our wall thanks to alow-energy theorem. This is based on our recent works hep-th/0009023 andhep-th/0107204.
