We recast the Podle\`s spheres in the noncommutative physics context byshowing that they can be regarded as slices along the time coordinate of thedifferent regions of the quantum Minkowski space-time. The investigation of thetransformations of the quantum sphere states under the left coaction of the${\cal SO}_{q}(3)$ group leads to a decomposition of the transformed Hilbertspace states in terms of orthogonal subspaces exhibiting the periodicity of thequantum sphere states.
