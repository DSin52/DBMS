Extension procedure for supermanifold ${\cal M}_{cl}$ of superfields ${\calA}^{\imath}(\theta)$, ghost number construction are considered. Classical and$\hbar$-deformed generating (master) equations, existence theorems for theirsolutions are formulated in $T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{min}$,$T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{ext}$. Analogous scheme is realized for BV similargenerating equations. Master equations versions for GSQM and BV similar schemeare deformed in powers of superfields ${\stackrel{\circ}{\Gamma}}{}^p(\theta)$= $\bigl({\stackrel{\circ}{\Phi}}{}^B(\theta)$,${\stackrel{\circ}{\Phi}}{}^{\ast}_B(\theta)\bigr)$ into supermanifold$T_{odd}(T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{ext})$. Arbitrariness in a choice of solutionsfor these equations is described. Investigation of formal Hamiltonian systemsfor II class theories [2] defined via corresponding master equations solutionsis conducted. Gauge fixing for those theories is described by two ways.Functional integral of superfunctions on $T_{odd}(T^{\ast}_{odd}{\calM}_{ext})$ is defined. Properties for generating functionals of Green'ssuperfunctions are studied. $\theta$-component quantization formulation,connection with BV method and superfield quantization [3] are established.Quantization scheme realization is demonstrated on 6 models.
