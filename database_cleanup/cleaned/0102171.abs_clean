We study the non-local regularization for the case of a spontaneously brokenabelian gauge theory in the R_xi gauge with an arbitrary gauge parameter xi. Weconsider a simple abelian-Higgs model with chiral couplings as an example. Weshow that if we apply the nonlocal regularization procedure [to construct anonlocal theory with finite mass parameter ] to the spontaneously broken R_xigauge Lagrangian, using the quadratic forms as appearing in this Lagrangian, wefind that a physical observable in this model, an analogue of the muonanomalous magnetic moment, evaluated to order O[g^{2}] does indeed showxi-dependence.We then apply the modified form of nonlocal regularization thatwas recently advanced and studied for the unbroken non-abelian gauge theoriesand discuss the resulting WT identities and xi-independence of the S-matrixelements.
