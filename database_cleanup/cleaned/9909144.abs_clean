We present some multiplets of N=2 off-shell supergravity in five dimensions.One is the Super Yang-Mills multiplet, another one is the linear multiplet. Thelatter one is used to establish a general action formula from which we derivean action for the Super Yang-Mills multiplet. The Super Yang-Mills multiplet isused to construct the nonlinear multiplet with gauged SU(2). This nonlinearmultiplet and the action formula for the Yang-Mills multiplet enable us towrite down an SU(2) gauged supergravity which we finally truncate to arrive atgauged supergravity with gauge group SO(2).
