We investigate light-cone structure on the world-volume of an unstableD-brane with a tachyon decaying inhomogeneously by using a field theoreticaldescription. It is shown that (i) light-cones governing open strings arenarrower than those governing closed strings and will eventually collapseinward in all directions except at kinks, where the tachyon remains at the topof its potential; and that (ii) light-cones governing open strings at a kinkwill be narrowed only in the direction perpendicular to the kink surface. It isalso shown that (iii) future-directed light-cones governing open strings near akink are tilted towards the kink, compared with those governing closed strings.The result (i) implies that open strings except at kinks are redshifted,compared with closed strings, and will eventually cease to be dynamical. On theother hand, the result (ii) shows that open strings on a kink surface can movefreely along the kink surface and are dynamical but do not feel the existenceof the spatial dimension perpendicular to the kink surface. The result (iii)indicates that open strings near a kink have tendency to move towards the kink.Hence, the light-cone structure vividly illustrates how open strings behaveduring the dynamical formation of a kink. We also discuss about a possibilitythat the early universe has a network of various dimensional D-branes,black-branes and tachyon matter. A problem associated with the network and apossible solution to the problem are discussed.
