Title: Another Leigh-Strassler deformation through the Matrix model

Authors: Teresia Mansson

Comments: 15 pages,2 figures

In here the matrix model approach, by Dijkgraaf and Vafa, is used in order toobtain the effective superpotential for a certain deformation of N=4 SYMdiscovered by Leigh and Strassler. An exact solution to the matrix modelLagrangian is found and is expressed in terms of elliptic functions.
