Title: Extended supersymmetry in D=1+1

Comments: 8 pages, Latex

We extend superspace by introducing an antisymmetric tensorial coordinate.The resulting theory presents a supersymmetry with central charge. Afterintegrating over the tensorial coordinate, an effective action describingmassive bosons and fermions is explicitely derived for the spacetime dimensionD=2. The adopted procedure is simpler than the Kaluza-Klein one and can suggestan alternative for string compactifications.
