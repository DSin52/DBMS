We show that for an eikonal limit of gravity in a space-time of any dimensionwith a non-vanishing cosmological constant, the Einstein -- Hilbert actionreduces to a boundary action. This boundary action describes the interaction ofshock-waves up to the point of evolution at which the forward light-cone of acollision meets the boundary of the space-time. The conclusions are quitegeneral and in particular generalize the previous work of E. and H. Verlinde.The role of the off-diagonal Einstein action in removing the bulk part of theaction is emphasised. We discuss the sense in which our result is a particularexample of holography and also the relation of our solutions in $AdS$ to thoseof Horowitz and Itzhaki.
