We show that supersymmetric and $\kappa$-symmetric Dp-brane actions in typeII supergravity background have the same duality transformation properties asthose in a flat Minkowskian background. Specially, it is shown that the superD-string transforms in a covariant way while the super D3-brane is self-dualunder the $SL(2,Z)$ duality. Also, the D2-brane and the D4-brane transform inways expected from the relation between type IIA superstring theory andM-theory. The present study proves that various duality symmetries, which wereoriginally found in the flat background field, are precisely valid even in thecurved background geometry.
