We apply the method of confining phase superpotentials to N = 2supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the exceptional gauge group G_2. Ourfindings are consistent with the spectral curve of the periodic Toda lattice,but do not agree with the hyperelliptic curve suggested previously in theliterature. We also apply the method to theories with fundamental matter,treating both the example of SO(5) and G_2.
