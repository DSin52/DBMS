The map between the moduli space of F-theory (or type II string)compactifications and heterotic string compactifications can be considerablysimplified by using "stable degenerations". We discuss how this method appliesto both the E8 x E8 and the Spin(32)/Z2 heterotic string. As a simpleapplication of this method we derive some basic properties of thenonperturbative physics of collections of E8 or Spin(32)/Z2 point-likeinstantons sitting at A-D-E singularities on a K3 surface.
