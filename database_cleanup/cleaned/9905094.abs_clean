We study fully localized BPS brane solutions in classical supergravity usinga perturbative approach to the coupled Born-Infeld/bulk supergravity system. Wederive first order bulk supergravity fields for world-volume solitonscorresponding to intersecting M2-branes and to a fundamental string ending on aD3-brane. One interesting feature is the appearance of certain off-diagonalmetric components and corresponding components of the gauge potentials. Makinguse of a supersymmetric ansatz for the exact fields, we formulate aperturbative expansion which applies to $M2 \perp M2 (0), M5 \perp M5 (3)$ and$Dp \perp Dp (p-2)$ intersections. We find that perturbation theorybreaks down at second order for intersecting M2-branes and D$p$-branes with$p\le 3$ while it is well behaved, at least to this order, for the remainingcases. This indicates that the behavior of the full non-linear intersectingDp-brane solutions may be qualitatively different for $p \le 3$ than for $p \ge4$, and that fully localized asymptotically flat solutions for $p \le 3$ maynot exist. We discuss the consistency of these results with world-volume fieldtheory properties.
