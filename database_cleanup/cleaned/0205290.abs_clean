We consider ``bubbles of nothing'' constructed by analytically continuingblack hole solutions in Anti-de Sitter space. These provide interestingexamples of smooth time-dependent backgrounds which can be studied through theAdS/CFT correspondence. Our examples include bubbles constructed fromSchwarzschild-AdS, Kerr-AdS and Reissner-Nordstrom AdS. The Schwarzschildbubble is dual to Yang-Mills theory on three dimensional de Sitter space timesa circle. We construct the boundary stress tensor of the bubble spacetime andrelate it to the properties of field theory on de Sitter.
