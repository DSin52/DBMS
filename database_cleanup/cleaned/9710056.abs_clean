Evaluating the propagator by the usual time-sliced manner, we use it tocompute the second virial coefficient of an anyon gas interacting through therepulsive potential of the form $g/r^2 (g > 0)$. All the cusps for theunpolarized spin-1/2 as well as spinless cases disappear in the $\omega \to 0$limit, where $\omega$ is a frequency of harmonic oscillator which is introducedas a regularization method. As $g$ approaches to zero, the result reduces tothe noninteracting hard-core limit.
