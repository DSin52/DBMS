Yuri Golfand memorial volume. We added the Appendix D with classification ofall non-trivial commuting n-tuples for arbitrary nWe consider the pure supersymmetric Yang--Mills theories placed on a small3-dimensional spatial torus with higher orthogonal and exceptional gaugegroups. The problem of constructing the quantum vacuum states is reduced to apure mathematical problem of classifying the flat connections on 3-torus. Thelatter problem is equivalent to the problem of classification of commutingtriples of elements in a connected simply connected compact Lie group which issolved in this paper. In particular, we show that for higher orthogonal SO(N),N > 6, and for all exceptional groups the moduli space of flat connectionsinvolves several distinct connected components. The total number ofvacuumstates is given in all cases by the dual Coxeter number of the groupwhich agrees with the result obtained earlier with the instanton technique.
