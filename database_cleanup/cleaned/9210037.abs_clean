Generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov (DS) hierarchies are constructed through localreductions of Hamiltonian flows generated by monodromy invariants on the dualof a loop algebra. Following earlier work of De Groot et al, reductions basedupon graded regular elements of arbitrary Heisenberg subalgebras areconsidered. We show that, in the case of the nontwisted loop algebra$\ell(gl_n)$, graded regular elements exist only in those Heisenbergsubalgebras which correspond either to the partitions of $n$ into the sum ofequal numbers $n=pr$ or to equal numbers plus one $n=pr+1$. We prove that thereduction belonging to the grade $1$ regular elements in the case $n=pr$ yieldsthe $p\times p$ matrix version of the Gelfand-Dickey $r$-KdV hierarchy,generalizing the scalar case $p=1$ considered by DS. The methods of DS areutilized throughout the analysis, but formulating the reduction entirely withinthe Hamiltonian framework provided by the classical r-matrix approach leads tosome simplifications even for $p=1$.
