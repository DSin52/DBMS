We propose a 5-dimensional definition for the physical 4D-Yang-Mills theory.The fifth dimension corresponds to the Monte-Carlo time of numericalsimulations of QCD_4. The 5-dimensional theory is a well-defined topologicalquantum field theory that can be renormalized at any given finite order ofperturbation theory. The relation to non-perturbative physics is obtained byexpressing the theory on a lattice, a la Wilson. The new fields that must beintroduced in the context of a topological Yang-Mills theory have a simplelattice expression. We present a 5-dimensional critical limit for physicalcorrelation functions and for dynamical auto-correlations, which allows newMonte-Carlo algorithm based on the time-step in lattice units given by $\e =g_0^{-13/11}$ in pure gluodynamics. The gauge-fixing in five dimensions is suchthat no Gribov ambiguity occurs. The weight is strictly positive, because allghost fields have parabolic propagators and yield trivial determinants. Weindicate how our 5-dimensional description of the Yang-Mills theory may beextended to fermions.
