As a novel application of string junctions, we provide evidence for theexistence of stable non-BPS dyons with magnetic charge greater than 1 in (thesemiclassical regime of) N=2 SU(2) Super-Yang-Mills theory. In addition, wefind a new curve of marginal stability. Moduli space is therefore divided intofour regions, each containing a different stable particle spectrum.
