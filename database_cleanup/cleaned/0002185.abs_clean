We provide analytical solutions to the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equationsin the large and small density approximations. We extend results previouslyobtained for leading order behaviour of the scaling function of affine Todafield theories related to simply laced Lie algebras to the non-simply lacedcase. The comparison with semi-classical methods shows perfect agreement forthe simply laced case. We derive the Y-systems for affine Toda field theorieswith real coupling constant and employ them to improve the large densityapproximations. We test the quality of our analysis explicitly for theSinh-Gordon model and the $(G_2^{(1)},D_4^{(3)})$-affine Toda field theory.
