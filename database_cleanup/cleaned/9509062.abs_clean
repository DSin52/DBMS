To describe a massive particle with fixed, but arbitrary, spin on $d=4$anti-de Sitter space $M^4$, we propose the point-particle model withconfiguration space ${\cal M}^6 = M^{4}\times S^{2}$, where the sphere $S^2$corresponds to the spin degrees of freedom. The model possesses two gaugesymmetries expressing strong conservation of the phase-space counterparts ofthe second- and fourth-order Casimir operators for $so(3,2)$. We prove that therequirement of energy to have a global positive minimum $E_o$ over theconfiguration space is equivalent to the relation $E_o > s$, $s$ being theparticle's spin, what presents the classical counterpart of the quantum massivecondition. States with the minimal energy are studied in detail. The model isshown to be exactly solvable. It can be straightforwardly generalized todescribe a spinning particle on $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter space $M^d$,with ${\cal M}^{2(d-1)} = M^d \times S^{(d-2)}$ the corresponding configurationspace.
