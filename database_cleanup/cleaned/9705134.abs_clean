We discuss the canonical quantization of non-unitary time evolution ininflating Universe. We consider gravitational wave modes in the FRW metrics ina de Sitter phase and show that the vacuum is a two-mode SU(1,1) squeezed stateof thermo field dynamics, thus exhibiting the link between inflationaryevolution and thermal properties. In particular we discuss the entropy and thefree energy of the system. The state space splits into many unitarilyinequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relationsparametrized by time $t$ and non-unitary time evolution is described as arunning over unitarily inequivalent representations. The generator of timeevolution is related to the entropy operator. A central ingredient in ourdiscussion is the doubling of the degrees of freedom which turns out to be thebridge to the unified picture of non-unitary time evolution, squeezing andthermal properties in inflating metrics.
