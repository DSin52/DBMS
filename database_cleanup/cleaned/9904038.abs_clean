The restricted class of Natanzon potentials with two free parameters isstudied within the context of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics. The hierarchyof Hamiltonians is indicated, where the first members of the superfamily areexplicitly evaluated and a general form for the superpotential is proposed.
