We consider a $CP^N$ model with the subgroup $SU(r)$ completely gauged, where$1 < r < N+1$. The gauge field dynamics is solely governed by a nonabelianChern-Simons term and the global $SU(N+1)$ symmetry is broken explicitly byintroducing a $SU(r)$ invariant scalar potential. We obtain self-dual equationsof this gauged $CP^N$ model and find that the energy is bounded from below by alinear combination of the topological charge and a global $U(1)$ charge presentin the theory. We also discuss on the self-dual soliton solutions of thismodel.
