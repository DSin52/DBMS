Gravitational theta-sectors are investigated in spatially locally homogeneouscosmological models with flat closed spatial surfaces in 2+1 and 3+1 spacetimedimensions. The metric ansatz is kept in its most general form compatible withHamiltonian minisuperspace dynamics. Nontrivial theta-sectors admitting asemiclassical no-boundary wave function are shown to exist only in 3+1dimensions, and there only for two spatial topologies. In both cases thespatial surface is nonorientable and the nontrivial no-boundary theta-sectorunique. In 2+1 dimensions the nonexistence of nontrivial no-boundarytheta-sectors is shown to be of topological origin and thus to transcend boththe semiclassical approximation and the minisuperspace ansatz. Relation to thenecessary condition given by Hartle and Witt for the existence of no-boundarytheta-states is discussed.
