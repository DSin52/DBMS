We propose a (generalized) ``mass formula'' for a fundamental stringdescribed as a BPS solution of a D-brane's worldvolume. The mass formula isobtained by using the Hamiltonian density on the worldvolume, based ontransformation properties required for it. Its validity is confirmed byinvestigating the cases of point charge solutions of D-branes in a D-8-brane(i.e. curved) background, where the mass of each of the corresponding stringsis proportional to the geodesic distance from the D-brane to the pointparametrized by the (regularized) value of a transverse scalar field. It isalso shown that the mass of the string agrees with the energy defined on theD-brane's worldvolume only in the flat background limit, but the agreement doesnot always hold when the background is curved.
