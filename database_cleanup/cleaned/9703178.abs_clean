The mechanism of generation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S^{BH}$ of ablack hole in the Sakharov's induced gravity is proposed. It is suggested thatthe "physical" degrees of freedom, which explain the entropy $S^{BH}$, formonly a finite subset of the standard Rindler-like modes defined outside theblack hole horizon. The entropy $S_R$ of the Rindler modes, or entanglemententropy, is always ultraviolet divergent, while the entropy of the "physical"modes is finite and it coincides in the induced gravity with $S^{BH}$. The twoentropies $S^{BH}$ and $S_R$ differ by a surface integral Q interpreted as aNoether charge of non-minimally coupled scalar constituents of the model. Wedemonstrate that energy E and Hamiltonian H of the fields localized in a partof space-time, restricted by the Killing horizon $\Sigma$, differ by thequantity $T_H Q$, where $T_H$ is the temperature of a black hole. The first lawof the black hole thermodynamics enables one to relate the probabilitydistribution of fluctuations of the black hole mass, caused by the quantumfluctuations of the fields, to the probability distribution of "physical" modesover energy E. The latter turns out to be different from the distribution ofthe Rindler modes. We show that the probability distribution of the "physical"degrees of freedom has a sharp peak at E=0 with the width proportional to thePlanck mass. The logarithm of number of "physical" states at the peak coincidesexactly with the black hole entropy $S^{BH}$. It enables us to argue that theenergy distribution of the "physical" modes and distribution of the black holemass are equivalent in the induced gravity. Finally it is shown that theNoether charge Q is related to the entropy of the low frequency modespropagating in the vicinity of the bifurcation surface $\Sigma$ of the horizon.
