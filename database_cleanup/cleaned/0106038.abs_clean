We consider the physics of enhancons as applied to four dimensional blackholes which are constructed by wrapping both D-branes and NS-branes on K3. Aswas recently shown for the five dimensional black holes, the enhancon iscrucial in maintaining consistency with the second law of thermodynamics. Thisis true for both the D-brane and NS-brane sectors of these black holes. Inparticular NS5-branes in both type IIA and IIB string theory are found toexhibit enhancon physics when wrapped on a K3 manifold.
