We generalize and extend a quantization procedure proposed by the presentauthors which is designed to quantize SU(N) gauge theories in the continuumwithout fixing the gauge and thereby avoid the Gribov problem. In particular wediscuss the BRS symmetry underlying the effective action. We proceed to usethis BRS symmetry to discuss the perturbative renormalization of the theory andshow that perturbatively the procedure is equivalent to Landau gauge fixing.This generalizes earlier results obtained in the Abelian case to thenon-abelian case and confirms the widely held believe that the Gribov problemmanifests itself on the non-perturbative level, while not affecting theperturbative results. A relation between the gluon mass and gluon condensate inQCD is obtained which yields a gluon mass consistent with other estimates forvalues of the gluon condensate obtained from QCD sum rules.
