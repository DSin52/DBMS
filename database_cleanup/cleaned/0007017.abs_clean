Authors: Bengt E.W. Nilsson

Comments: Talk given at 31st International Symposium Ahrenshoop, Sept 2-6,

1997, Buckow, GermanyRecent developments in string and M theory rely heavily on supersymmetrysuggesting that a revival of superspace techniques in ten and eleven dimensionsmay be advantageous. Here we discuss three topics of current interest wheresuperspace is already playing an important role and where an improvedunderstanding of superspace might provide additional insight into the issuesinvolved.
