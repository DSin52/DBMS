Title: Strings and Singularities

Authors: Cumrun Vafa

Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures

We review aspects of spacetime singularities from the view point of stringtheory. Examples considered include cosmological, cosmic string and black-holesingularities. We also discuss the consistency of viewing black-holes asexcited states of fundamental strings (based on talk presented at Salamfest,March 1993, Trieste).
