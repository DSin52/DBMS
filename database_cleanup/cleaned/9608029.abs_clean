We study the discrete and gauge symmetries of Quantum Electrodynamics atfinite temperature within the real-time formalism.The gauge invariance of the complete generating functional leads to thefinite temperature Ward identities. These Ward identities relate the eightvertex functions to the elements of the self-energy matrix. Combining therelations obtained from the $Z_2$ and the gauge symmetries of the theory wefind that only one out of eight longitudinal vertex functions is independent.As a consequence of the Ward identities it is shown that some elements of thevertex function are singular when the photon momentum goes to zero.
