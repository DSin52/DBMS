Title: Gauging Wess-Zumino-Witten Models

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX, Contribution to the proceedings of the "Workshop on

gauge theories, applied supersymmetry and quantum gravity", Leuven, july 1995We review some aspects of gauged WZW models. By choosing a nilpotent subgroupfield theories with an extended conformal symmetry, the construction of theeffective action of (extended) 2D gravities and the systematic construction ofstring theories with some extended gauge symmetry.
