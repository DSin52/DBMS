Phase transitions are studied in $M$-theory and $F$-theory. In $M$-theorycompactification to five dimensions on a Calabi-Yau, there aretopology-changing transitions similar to those seen in conformal field theory,but the non-geometrical phases known in conformal field theory are absent. Atboundaries of moduli space where such phases might have been expected, themoduli space ends, by a conventional or unconventional physical mechanism. Theunconventional mechanisms, which roughly involve the appearance of tensionlessstrings, can sometimes be better understood in $F$-theory.
