Finite versions of W-algebras are introduced by considering (symplectic)reductions of finite dimensional simple Lie algebras. In particular a finiteanalogue of $W^{(2)}_3$ is introduced and studied in detail. Its unitary andnon-unitary, reducible and irreducible highest weight representations areconstructed.
