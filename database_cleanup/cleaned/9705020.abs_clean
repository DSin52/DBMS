The stability problem for the O(N) nonlinear sigma model in the 2+\epsilondimensions is considered. We present the results of the 1/N^{2} ordercalculations of the critical exponents (in the 2<d<4 dimensions) of thecomposite operators relevant for this problem. The arguments in the favor ofthe scenario with the conventional fixed point are given.
