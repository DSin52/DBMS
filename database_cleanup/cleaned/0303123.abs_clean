By using the relativistic top theory, we derive a relativistic top deviationequation. This equation turns out to be a generalization of the geodesicdeviation equation for a pair of nearby point particles. In fact, we show thatwhen the spin angular momentum tensor associated to the top vanishes, such arelativistic top deviation equation reduces to the geodesic deviation equationfor spinless point particles. Just as the geodesic deviation equation forspinless particles can be used to investigate the detection of gravitationalwaves, our generalized formula for a relativistic top can be used to study thegravitational wave background. Our formulation may be of special interest todetect the inflationary gravitational waves via the polarization of the cosmicbackground radiation.
