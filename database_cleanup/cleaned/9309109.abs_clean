We give an action that can be used to describe the production of globalvortices in 2+1 dimensions by scattering Nambu-Goldstone bosons. At strongself-coupling the action reduces to scalar QED with particular values of thecoupling constants and the production cross-section is explicitly found. Wealso consider the production of gauged vortices by scattering particles thathave an Aharanov-Bohm interaction with the vortex.
