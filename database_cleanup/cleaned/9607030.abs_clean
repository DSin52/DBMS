The general structure of the perturbative expansion of the vacuum expectationvalue of a product of Wilson-loop operators is analyzed in the context ofChern-Simons gauge theory. Wilson loops are opened into Wilson lines in orderto unravel the algebraic structure encoded in the group factors of theperturbative series expansion. In the process a factorization theorem is provedfor Wilson lines. Wilson lines are then closed back into Wilson loops and newlink invariants of finite type are defined. Integral expressions for theseinvariants are presented for the first three primitive ones of lower degree inthe case of two-component links. In addition, explicit numerical results areobtained for all two-component links of no more than six crossings up to degreefour.
