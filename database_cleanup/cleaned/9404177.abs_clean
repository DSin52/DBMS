We show that general cutoff scalar field theories in four dimensions areperturbatively renormalizable through the use of diagrammatic techniques and anadapted BPH renormalization method. Weinberg's convergence theorem is used toshow that operators in the Lagrangian with dimension greater than four, whichare divided by powers of the cutoff, produce perturbatively only localdivergences in the two-, three-, and four-point correlation functions. We alsoshow that the renormalized Green's functions are the same as in ordinary$\Phi^4$ theory up to corrections suppressed by inverse powers of the cutoff.These conclusions are consistent with those of existing proofs based on therenormalization group.
