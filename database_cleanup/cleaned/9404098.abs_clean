We define basics of $(4,4)\;\; 2D$ harmonic superspace with two independentsets of $SU(2)$ harmonic variables and apply it to construct new superfieldactions of $(4,4)$ supersymmetric two-dimensional sigma models with torsion andmutually commuting left and right complex structures, as well as of theirmassive deformations. We show that the generic off-shell sigma model action isthe general action of constrained analytic superfields $q^{(1,1)}$ representingtwisted $N=4$ multiplets in $(4,4)$ harmonic superspace. The massive term of$q^{(1,1)}$ is shown to be unique; it generates a scalar potential the form ofwhich is determined by the metric on the target bosonic manifold. We discuss indetail $(4,4)$ supersymmetric group manifold $SU(2)\times U(1)$ WZNW sigmamodel and its Liouville deformation. A deep analogy of the relevantsuperconformally invariant analytic superfield action to that of the improvedtensor $N=2\;\;4D$ multiplet is found. We define $(4,4)$ duality transformationand find new off-shell dual representations of the previously constructedactions via {\it unconstrained} analytic $(4,4)$ superfields. The dualrepresentation suggests some hints of how to describe $(4,4)$ models withnon-commuting complex structures in the harmonic superspace.
