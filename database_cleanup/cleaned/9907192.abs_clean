The Casimir energy of an infinite compact cylinder placed in a uniformunbounded medium is investigated under the continuity condition for the lightvelocity when crossing the interface. As a characteristic parameter in theproblem the ratio $\xi^2=(\epsilon_1-\epsilon_2)^2/ (\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2)^-2= (\mu_1-\mu_2)^2/(\mu_1+ \mu_2)^2 \le 1$ is used, where $\epsilon_1$ and$\mu_1$ are, respectively, the permittivity and permeability of the materialmaking up the cylinder and $\epsilon_2$ and $\mu_2$ are those for thesurrounding medium. It is shown that the expansion of the Casimir energy inpowers of this parameter begins with the term proportional to $\xi^4$. Theexplicit formulas permitting us to find numerically the Casimir energy for anyfixed value of $\xi^2$ are obtained. Unlike a compact ball with the sameproperties of the materials, the Casimir forces in the problem underconsideration are attractive. The implication of the calculated Casimir energyin the flux tube model of confinement is briefly discussed.
