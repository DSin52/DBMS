We present nontrivial examples of d=3 gauge theories with sixteen and eightsupercharges which are infrared dual at special points in the moduli space.This duality is distinct from mirror symmetry. To demonstrate duality weconstruct the gauge theories of interest using D2-branes and orientifolds andthen consider their lift to M-theory. We also discuss the strong coupling limitof orientifold two-planes and orbifolds of orientifold six-planes.
