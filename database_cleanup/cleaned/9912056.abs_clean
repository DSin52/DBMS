The Kalb-Ramond monopole, as discussed by Nepomechie, is identical with the(singular) Dirac monopole in d=3 dimensions. The latter can be described by the(regular) 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, via the 't Hooft tensor construction.This construction is extended to arbitrary odd dimensions by performing the d=5case explicitly, exploiting the (regular) `monopoles' of generalisedGeorgi-Glashow models and identifying their 't Hooft tensors as the Kalb-Ramondfields. The relevant `magnetic charges' are expressed as topologicalinvariants.
