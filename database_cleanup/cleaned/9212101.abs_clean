Title: A Deformed Poincar\'e Algebra On A Cubic Lattice

Authors: Sebastian Sachse

Comments: #5, latex

Replacing the continuous space by a cubic lattice we find a deformation ofthe Poincar\'e algebra. A deformation of the relativistic mass operator isshown to be a Casimir of the algebra. The real structure is preserved.
