Using the Fock-Schwinger proper time method, we calculate the inducedChern-Simons term arising from the Lorentz- and CPT-violating sector of quantumelectrodynamics with a $b_\mu \bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu \gamma_5 \psi$ term. Ourresult to all orders in $b$ coincides with a recent linear-in-$b$ calculationby Chaichian et al. [hep-th/0010129 v2]. The coincidence was pointed out byChung [Phys. Lett. {\bf B461} (1999) 138] and P\'{e}rez-Victoria [Phys. Rev.Lett. {\bf 83} (1999) 2518] in the standard Feynman diagram calculation withthe nonperturbative-in-$b$ propagator.
