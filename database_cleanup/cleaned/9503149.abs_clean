String theory abounds with light scalar fields (the dilaton and variousmoduli) which create a host of observational problems, and notably some seriouscosmological difficulties similar to the ones associated with the Polonyi fieldin the earliest versions of spontaneously broken supergravity. We show that allthese problems are naturally avoided if a recently introduced mechanism forfixing the vacuum expectation values of the dilaton and/or moduli is at work.We study both the classical evolution and the quantum fluctuations of suchscalar fields during a primordial inflationary era and find that the resultsare naturally compatible with observational facts. In this model, dilatons ormoduli within a very wide range of masses (which includes the SUSY-breakingfavored 1 TeV value and extends up to the Planck scale) qualify to define anovel type of essentially stable ultra-weakly interacting massive particlesable to provide enough mass density to close the universe
