We perform a BRST analysis of the N=2 superconformal minimal unitary models.A bosonic as well as fermionic BRST operators are used to construct irreduciblerepresentations of the N=2 superconformal algebra on the Fock space as BRSTcohomology classes of the BRST operators. Also a character formula is rederivedby using the BRST analysis.
