We study the dynamics of Green-Schwarz superstring on the gravitational wavebackground corresponding to the Matrix string theory and the supersymmetrytransformation rules of the superstring. The dynamics is obtained in thelight-cone formulation and is shown to agree with that derived from the Matrixstring theory. The supersymmetry structure has the corrections due to theeffect of the background and is identified with that of the low energy one-loopeffective action of Matrix string theory in two superstring background in theweak string coupling limit.
