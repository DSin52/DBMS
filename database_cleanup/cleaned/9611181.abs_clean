Quantum Liouville theory is analyzed in terms of the infinite dimensionalrepresentations of $U_Qsl(2,C)$ with q a root of unity. Making full use ofcharacteristic features of the representations, we show that vertex operatorsin this Liouville theory are factorized into `classical' vertex operators andthose which are constructed from the finite dimensional representations of$U_qsl(2,C)$. We further show explicitly that fusion rules in this model alsoenjoys such a factorization. Upon the conjecture that the Liouville actioneffectively decouples into the classical Liouville action and that of a quantumtheory, correlation functions and transition amplitudes are discussed,especially an intimate relation between our model and geometric quantization ofthe moduli space of Riemann surfaces is suggested. The most important result isthat our Liouville theory is in the strong coupling region, i.e., the centralcharge c_L satisfies $1<c_L<25$. An interpretation of quantum space-time isalso given within this formulation.
