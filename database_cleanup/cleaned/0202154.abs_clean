We present an alternative quantization for irreducible open gauge theories.The method relies on the possibility of modifying the classical BRST operatorand the gauge-fixing action written as in Yang-Mills type theories, in order toobtain an on-shell invariant quantum action by using equations characterizingthe full gauge algebra. From this follows then the construction of an off-shellversion of the theory. We show how it is possible to build off-shell BRSTalgebra together with an invariant extension of the classical action. This isrealized via a systematic prescription for the introduction of auxiliaryfields.
