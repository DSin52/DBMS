The quon algebra describes particles, ``quons,'' that are neither fermionsnor bosons using a label q that parametrizes a smooth interpolation betweenbosons (q = +1) and fermions (q = -1). We derive ``conservation of statistics''relations for quons in relativistic theories, and show that in relativistictheories quons must be either bosons or fermions.
