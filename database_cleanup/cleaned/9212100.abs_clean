The problem of interpreting a set of ${\cal W}$-algebra constraintsconstructed in terms of an arbitrarily twisted scalar field as the recursionrelations of a topological theory is addressed. In this picture, theconventional models of topological gravity coupled to $A$, $D$ or $E$topological matter, correspond to taking the scalar field twisted by theCoxeter element of the Weyl group. It turns out that not all conjugacy classesof the Weyl group lead to a topological model. For example, it is shown thatfor the $A$ algebras there are two possible choices for the conjugacy class,giving both the conventional and a new series of topological models.Furthermore, it is shown how the new series of theories contains theconventional series as a subsector. A tentative interpretation of this newseries in terms of intersection theory is presented.
