We consider the quantum mechanics of a particle on a noncommutative plane.The case of a charged particle in a magnetic field (the Landau problem) with aharmonic oscillator potential is solved. There is a critical point, where thedensity of states becomes infinite, for the value of the magnetic field equalto the inverse of the noncommutativity parameter. The Landau problem on thenoncommutative two-sphere is also solved and compared to the plane problem.
