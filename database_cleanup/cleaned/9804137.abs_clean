The two-dimensional anyon system, when reduced to one dimension, yieldsmodels related to the Calogero-Sutherland model. One such reduction leads to anew model with a class of exact solutions. This model is one of a family ofmodels obtained upon dimensional reduction of spherically symmetric models inarbitrary dimensions.
