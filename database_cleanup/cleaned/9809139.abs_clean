We construct super AdS black holes in 2+1 dimensions in terms of Chern Simonsgauge theory of N=(1,1) super AdS group coupled to a (super)source. We take thesource to be a super AdS state specified by its Casimir invariants. We showthat the corresponding space-time is a supermultiplet of AdS space-timesrelated to each other by supersymmetry transformations. We give explicitexpressions for the masses and the angular momenta of the black holes in asupermultiplet. With one exception, for N=(1,1) one pair of extremal blackholes can be accommodated in such all-black hole supermultiplets. Therequirement that the source be a unitary representation leads to a discretetower of excited states which provide a microscopic model for the super blackhole.
