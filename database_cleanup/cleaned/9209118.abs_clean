We analyze a supergravity theory coupled to a dilaton and superconformalmatters in two dimensions. This theory is classically soluble and we find allthe solutions appeared in Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger's dilatonicgravity also satisfy the constraints and the equations of motion in thissupersymmetric theory. We quantize this theory by following the procedure ofDistler, Hlousek and Kawai. In the quantum action, the cosmological term isrenormalized to vanish. As a result, any solution corresponding to classicalblack hole does not appear in the quantum theory, which should be compared withthe non-supersymmetric case.
