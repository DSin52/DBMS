Aftera short introduction on strings in Minkowski and curved spacetimes, we focus onstrings in cosmological spacetimes. The classical behaviour of strings in FRWand inflationary spacetimes is now understood in a large extent from varioustypes of explicit string solutions. Three different types of behaviour appearFor the unstable strings, the energy and size grow for large scale factors $R\to \infty$, proportional to $R$. For the dual to unstable strings, the energyand size blow up for $R\to 0$ as $1/R$. For stable strings, the energy andproper size are bounded. (In Minkowski spacetime, all string solutions are ofthe stable type).Recent progress on self-consistent solutions to the Einsteinequations for string dominated universes is reviewed. The energy-momentumtensor for a gas of strings is then considered as source of the spacetimegeometry and from the above string behaviours the string equation of state isdetermined. The self-consistent string solution exhibits the realistic matterdominated behaviour $R \sim (X^0)^{2/3}\; $ for large times and the radiationdominated behaviour $R \sim (X^0)^{1/2}\;$ for early times. Finally, we reporton the exact integrability of the string equations plus the constraints in deSitter spacetime that allows to systematically find {\bf exact} stringsolutions by soliton methods and the multistring solutions. {\bf Multistringsolutions} are a new feature in curved spacetimes. That is, a singleworld-sheet simultaneously describes many different and independent strings.This phenomenon has no analogue in flat spacetime and follows to the couplingof the strings with the geometry.
