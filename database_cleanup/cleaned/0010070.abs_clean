Title: Comment on "First Order Transition in the Ginzburg-Landau Model"

Authors: H. Fort

Comments: 2 pages, 2 postscript (eps) figures

I present clear evidences that for $d$=2 a first order transition takes placewhen the coherence length $\xi$ becomes of the order of the lattice spacing andthat this is connected with a sudden proliferation of vortices. Similar resultswhere reported in cond-mat/0010119 although using a different parametrizationof the G-L model which obscures the comparison with recent results obtained bymeans of a variational approximation.
