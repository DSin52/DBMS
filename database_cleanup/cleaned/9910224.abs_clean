Using the collective field theory approach of large-N generalizedtwo-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on cylinder, it is shown that the classicalequation of motion of collective field is a generalized Hopf equation. Then,using the Itzykson-Zuber integral at the large-N limit, it is found that theclassical Young tableau density, which satisfies the saddle-point equation anddetermines the large-N limit of free energy, is the inverse of the solution ofthis generalized Hopf equation, at a certain point.
