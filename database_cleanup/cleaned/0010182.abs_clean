Comments: 8 pages. Summarises the methods and results of hep-th/0010167

We present the supersymmetrisation of the anomaly-related R^4 term in elevendimensions and show that it induces no non-trivial modifications to theon-shell supertranslation algebra and the superspace torsion constraints beforeinclusion of gauge-field terms.
