It has been conjectured that at the stationary point of the tachyon potentialfor the non-BPS D-brane or brane-anti-D-brane pair, the negative energy densitycancels the brane tension. We study this conjecture using a cubic superstringfield theory with insertion of a double-step inverse picture changing operator.We compute the tachyon potential at levels (1/2,1) and (2,6). In the first casewe obtain that the value of the potential at the minimum is 97.5% of the nonBPS D-brane tension. Using a special gauge in the second case we get 105.8% ofthe tension.
