We present our results of a numerical investigation of the behaviour of asystem of two solitons in the (2+1) dimensional $CP^1$ model on a torus.Defined by the elliptic function of Weierstrass, and working in the Skyrmeversion of the model, the soliton lumps exhibit splitting, scattering at rightangles and motion reversal in the various configurations considered. The workis restricted to systems with no initial velocity.
