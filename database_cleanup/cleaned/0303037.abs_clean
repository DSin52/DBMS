Comments: TeX, 37 pages. Since recent and forthcoming articles (hep-th/0105251,

hep-th/0201222, hep-th/0301100) are based on this paper, we thought it wouldbe convenient for the readers to have it available on the webJournal-ref: Commun.Math.Phys. 172 (1995) 187-220

We propose uncertainty relations for the different coordinates of spacetimeevents, motivated by Heisenberg's principle and by Einstein's theory ofclassical gravity. A model of Quantum Spacetime is then discussed where thecommutation relations exactly implement our uncertainty relations.We outline the definition of free fields and interactions over QST and takethe first steps to adapting the usual perturbation theory. The quantum natureof the underlying spacetime replaces a local interaction by a specific nonlocaleffective interaction in the ordinary Minkowski space. A detailed study ofinteracting QFT and of the smoothing of ultraviolet divergences is deferred toa subsequent paper.In the classical limit where the Planck length goes to zero, our QuantumSpacetime reduces to the ordinary Minkowski space times a two component spacewhose components are homeomorphic to the tangent bundle TS^2 of the 2-sphere.The relations with Connes' theory of the standard model will be studiedelsewhere.
