We show that the Hilbert space basis that defines the Ponzano-Regge-Turaev-Viro-Ooguri combinatorial definition of 3-d Quantum Gravity is the sameas the one that defines the Loop Representation. We show how to compute lengthsin Witten's 3-d gravity and how to reconstruct the 2-d geometry from a state ofWitten's theory. We show that the non-degenerate geometries are contained inthe Witten's Hilbert space. We sketch an extension of the combinatorialconstruction to the physical 4-d case, by defining a modification of Reggecalculus in which areas, rather than lengths, are taken as independentvariables. We provide an expression for the scalar product in the Looprepresentation in 4-d. We discuss the general form of a nonperturbative quantumtheory of gravity, and argue that it should be given by a generalization ofAtiyah's topological quantum field theories axioms.
