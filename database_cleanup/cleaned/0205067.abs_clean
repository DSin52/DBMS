We consider supersymmetric PP-wave limits for different N=1 orbifoldgeometries of the five sphere S^5 and the five dimensional Einstein manifoldT^{1,1}. As there are several interesting ways to take the Penrose limits, thePP-wave geometry can be either maximal supersymmetric N=4 or half-maximalsupersymmetric N=2. We discuss in detail the cases AdS_5 x S^5/Z_3, AdS_5 xS^5/(Z_m x Z_n) and AdS_5 x T^{1,1}/(\Z_m \times \Z_n) and we identify thegauge invariant operators which correspond to stringy excitations for thedifferent limits.
