Pure Yang-Mills theories on the $S_1\times R$ cylinder are quantized inlight-cone gauge $A_-=0$ by means of ${\bf equal-time}$ commutation relations.Positive and negative frequency components are excluded from the ``physical"Hilbert space by imposing Gauss' law in a weak sense. Zero modes, related tothe winding on the cylinder, provide non trivial topological variables of thecan be exactly computed obtaining the expected area result, whereasdifficulties are pointed out in non abelian cases.
