Title: A Remark On Field Theories On The Non-Commutative Torus

Authors: Robert C. Helling (HU Berlin)

We investigate field theories on the non-commutative torus upon varyingtheta, the parameter of non-commutativity. We argue that one should think ofMorita equivalence as a symmetry of algebras describing the same space ratherthan of theories living on different spaces (as is T-duality). Then we givearguments why physical observables depend on theta non-continuously.
