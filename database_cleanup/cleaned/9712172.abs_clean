We study the moduli space of vacua of four dimensional N=1 and N=2supersymmetric gauge theories with the gauge groups $Sp(2 N_c)$, $SO(2 N_c)$and $SO(2 N_c +1)$ using the M theory fivebrane. Higgs branches of the N=2supersymmetric gauge theories are interpreted in terms of the M theoryfivebrane and the type IIA $s$-rule is realized in it. In particular weconstruct the fivebrane configuration which corresponds to a special Higgsbranch root. This root is analogous to the baryonic branch root in the$SU(N_c)$ theory which remains as a vacuum after the adjoint mass perturbationto break N=2 to N=1. Furthermore we obtain the monopole condensations and themeson vacuum expectation values in the confining phase of N=1 supersymmetricgauge theories using the fivebrane technique. These are in complete agreementwith the field theory results for the vacua in the phase with a single confinedphoton.
