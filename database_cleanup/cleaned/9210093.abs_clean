We give exact solutions for a recently developed ~$N=1$~ locallysupersymmetric self-dual gauge theories in $~(2+2)\-$dimensions. We give theexact solutions for an $~SL(2)$~ self-dual Yang-Mills multiplet and what wecall ``self-dual tensor multiplet'' on the gravitational instanton backgroundby Eguchi-Hanson. We use a general method to get an $~SL(2)$~ self-dualYang-Mills solution from any known self-dual gravity solution. Our result isthe first example of exact solutions for the coupled system of these $~N=1$~locally supersymmetric self-dual multiplets in ~$(2+2)\-$dimensions, which issupposed to have strong significance for integrable models in lower-dimensionsupon appropriate dimensional reduction or truncation. We also inspect theconsistency of our exact solutions as a background for $~N=2$~ superstringcoupled to the Wess-Zumino-Witten term in $~\s\-$model formulation.
