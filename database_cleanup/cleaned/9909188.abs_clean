In this paper, relying on previous results of one of us on harmonic analysis,we derive the complete spectrum of Osp(3|4) X SU(3) multiplets that one obtainscompactifying D=11 supergravity on the unique homogeneous space N^{0,1,0} thathas a tri-sasakian structure, namely leads to N=3 supersymmetry both in thefour-dimensional bulk and on the three-dimensional boundary. As in previouslyanalyzed cases the knowledge of the Kaluza Klein spectrum, together withgeneral information on the geometric structure of the compact manifold is anessential ingredient to guess and construct the corresponding superconformalfield theory. This is work in progress. As a bonus of our analysis we deriveand present the explicit structure of all unitary irreducible representationsof the superalgebra Osp(3|4) with maximal spin content s_{max}>=2.
