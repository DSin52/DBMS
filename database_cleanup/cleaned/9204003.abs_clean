We find the rules which count the energy levels of the 3 statesuperintegrable chiral Potts model and demonstrate that these rules arecomplete. We then derive the complete spectrum of excitations in thethermodynamic limit in the massive phase and demonstrate the existence ofexcitations which do not have a quasi-particle form. The physics of theseexcitations is compared with the BCS superconductivity spectrum and thecounting rules are compared with the closely related $S=1$ XXZ spin chain.
