By casting the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations of an SU(2) theory in the form ofthe Ernst equations of general relativity, it is shown how the known exactsolutions of general relativity can be used to give similiar solutions forYang-Mills theory. Thus all the known exact solutions of general relativitywith axial symmetry (e.g. the Kerr metric, the Tomimatsu-Sato metric) haveYang-Mills equivalents. In this paper we only examine in detail the Kerr-likesolution. It will be seen that this solution has surfaces where the gauge andscalar fields become infinite, which correspond to the infinite redshiftsurfaces of the normal Kerr solution. It is speculated that this feature may beconnected with the confinement mechanism since any particle which carries anSU(2) color charge would tend to become trapped once it passes these surfaces.Unlike the Kerr solution, our solution apparently does not have any intrinsicangular momentum, but rather appears to give the non-Abelian fieldconfiguration associated with concentric shells of color charge.
