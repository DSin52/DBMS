In this review we show that a Clifford algebra possesses a unique irreduciblerepresentation; the spinor representation. We discuss what types of spinors canexist in Minkowski space-times and we explain how to construct all thesupersymmetry algebras that contain a given space-time Lie algebra. Afterderiving the irreducible representations of the superymmetry algebras, weexplain how to use them to systematically construct supergravity theories. Wegive the maximally supersymmetric supergravity theories in ten and elevendimensions and discuss their properties. We find which superbranes can existfor a given supersymmetry algebra and we give the dynamics of the superbranesthat occur in M theory. Finally, we discuss how the properties of supergravitytheories and superbranes provide evidence for string duality.In effect, we present a continuous chain of argument that begins withClifford algebras and leads via supersymmetry algebras and their irreduciblerepresentations to supergravity theories, string duality, brane dynamics and Mtheory.
