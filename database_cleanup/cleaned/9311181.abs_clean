Quantum gravitational effects on the renormalization group equation arestudied in the $(2+\epsilon)$-dimensional approach. Divergences in a matterone-loop effective action do not receive gravitational radiative corrections.The renormalization factor for beta functions recently found by Klebanov, Koganand Polyakov is obtained by using the renormalized cosmological constant todefine the physical scale transformation.
