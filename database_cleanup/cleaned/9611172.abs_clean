We study orbifolds of (0,2) models, including some cases with discretetorsion. Our emphasis is on models which have a Landau-Ginzburg realization,where we describe part of the massless spectrum by computing the elliptic genusfor the orbifolded theory. Somewhat surprisingly, we find simple examples of(0,2) mirror pairs that are related by a quotient action. We present a detaileddescription of a family of such pairs.
