Title: Kinetic equation for tachyons

Comments: 6 pages, revtex file, no figures

The tachyonic regime of the quantum fluctuations of a self-interacting scalarfield around its vacuum mean value is studied within a kinetic approach. Wederive a quantum kinetic equation which determines the time evolution of themomentum distribution function of produced tachyonic modes and includes memoryeffects. The back-reaction of the quantum fluctuations on the vaccum mean fieldis taken into account, while their interaction is neglected. We show that thetachyonic modes do not correspond to real particles and contribute to the decayof the metastable vacuum state.
