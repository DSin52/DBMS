We consider a (2+1) dimensional nonlinear O(3) sigma model with its U(1)subgroup gauged along with the inclusion of a self-interaction having symmetrybreaking minima.The gauge field dynamics is governed by the Maxwell term.Themodel is shown to support topologically stable purely magnetic self-dualvortices.
