Biconformal gauging of the conformal group has a scale-invariant volume form,permitting a single form of the action to be invariant in any dimension. Wedisplay several 2n-dim scale-invariant polynomial actions and a dual action. Wesolve the field equations for the most general action linear in the curvaturesfor a minimal torsion geometry. In any dimension n>2, the solution is foliatedby equivalent n-dim Ricci-flat Riemannian spacetimes, and the full 2n-dim spaceis symplectic. Two fields defined entirely on the Riemannian submanifolds
