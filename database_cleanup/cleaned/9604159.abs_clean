Title: Spectrum of cosmic gravitational wave background

Comments: Extrapolation formula and one typo corrected. Latex, 6 pages, 2 eps

figuresModels of string cosmology predict a stochastic background of gravitationalwaves with a spectrum that is strongly tilted towards high frequencies. I givesimple approximate expressions for spectral densities of the cosmic backgroundwhich can be directly compared with sensitivities of gravitational wavedetectors.
