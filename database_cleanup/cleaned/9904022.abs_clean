The formulation of gravity in 3+1 dimensions in which the spin connection isthe basic field ($\omega $-frame) leads to a theory with first and second classconstraints. Here, the Dirac brackets for the second class constraints areevaluated and the Dirac algebra of first class constraints is found to be theusual algebra associated to space-time reparametrizations and tangent spacerotations. This establishes the classical equivalence with the vierbeinapproach (e-frame). The explicit form of the path integral for this theory isgiven and the quantum equivalence with the e-frame is also established.
