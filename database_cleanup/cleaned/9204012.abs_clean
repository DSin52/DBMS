We study in a systematic and modular invariant way gaugino condensation inthe hidden sector as a potential source of hierarchical supersymmetry breakingand a non--trivial potential for the dilaton $S$ whose real part corresponds tothe tree level gauge coupling constant (${\rm Re}\ S\sim g_{gut}^{-2}$). Forthe case of pure Yang--Mills condensation, we show that no realistic results(in particular no reasonable values for ${\rm Re}\ S$) can emerge, even if thehidden gauge group is not simple. However, in the presence of hidden matter(i.e. the most frequent case) there arises a very interesting class ofscenarios with two or more hidden condensing groups for which the dilatondynamically acquires a reasonable value (${\rm Re}\ S\sim 2$) and supersymmetryis broken at the correct scale ($m_{3/2}\sim 10^3\ GeV$) with no need offine--tuning. Actually, good values for ${\rm Re}\ S$ and $m_{3/2}$ arecorrelated. We make an exhaustive classification of the working possibilities.Remarkably, the results are basically independent from the value of$\delta^{GS}$ (the contributions from the Green--Schwarz mechanism). The radiusof the compactified space also acquires an expectation value, breaking dualityspontaneously.
