We consider the coupling of a single Dirac fermion to the three componentunit vector field which appears as an order parameter in the Faddeev model.Classically, the coupling is determined by requiring that it preserves acertain local frame independence. But quantum mechanically the separate leftand right chiral fermion number currents suffer from a frame anomaly. We employthis anomaly to compute the fermion number of a knotted soliton. The resultcoincides with the self-linking number of the soliton. In particular, theanomaly structure of the fermions relates directly to the inherent chiralproperties of the soliton. Our result suggests that interactions betweenfermions and knotted solitons can lead to phenomena akin the Callan-Rubakoveffect.
