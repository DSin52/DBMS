A very general calculational strategy is applied to the evaluation of thedivergent physical amplitudes which are typical of perturbative calculations.With this approach in the final results all the intrinsic arbitrariness of thecalculations due to the divergent character is still present. We show that byusing the symmetry properties as a guide to search for the (compulsory) choicesin such a way as to avoid ambiguities, a deep and clear understanding of therole of regularization methods emerges. Requiring then an universal point ofview for the problem, as allowed by our approach, very interesting conclusionscan be stated about the possible justifications of most intriguing aspect of
