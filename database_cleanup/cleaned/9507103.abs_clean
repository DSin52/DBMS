We derive a simple calculation rule for Aoyama--Tamra's prescription for pathintegral with degenerated potential minima. Non-perturbative corrections due tothe restricted functional space (fundamental region) can systematically becomputed with this rule. It becomes manifest that the prescription might giveBorel summable series for finite temperature (or volume) system with quantumtunneling, while the advantage is lost at zero temperature (or infinite volume)limit.
