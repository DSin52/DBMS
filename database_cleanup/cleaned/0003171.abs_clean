We present intermediate results of an ongoing investigation which attempts ageneralization of the well known one-loop Bern Kosower rules of Yang-Millstheory to higher loop orders. We set up a general procedure to extract thefield theoretical limit of bosonic open string diagrams, based on the sewingconstruction of higher loop world sheets. It is tested with one- and two-loopscalar field theory, as well as one-loop and two-loop vacuum Yang-Millsdiagrams, reproducing earlier results. It is then applied to two-loop two-pointYang-Mills diagrams in order to extract universal renormalization coefficientsthat can be compared to field theory. While developing numerous technical toolsto compute the relevant contributions, we hit upon important conceptualcertain preferred gauge? Do they employ a certain preferred renormalizationscheme? Are four gluon vertices related to three gluon vertices? Unfortunately,our investigations remained inconclusive up to now.
