The fuzzy supersphere $S_F^{(2,2)}$ is a finite-dimensional matrixapproximation to the supersphere $S^{(2,2)}$ incorporating supersymmetryexactly. Here the star-product of functions on $S_F^{(2,2)}$ is obtained byutilizing the OSp(2,1) coherent states. We check its graded commutative limitto $S^{(2,2)}$ and extend it to fuzzy versions of sections of bundles using themethods of [1]. A brief discussion of the geometric structure of ourstar-product completes our work.
