Auxiliary string fields are introduced in light-cone gauge string fieldtheory in order to express contact interactions as contractions of cubicvertices. The auxiliary field in the purely closed-string bosonic theory may begiven a non-zero expectation value, leading to a phase in which world-sheetshave boundaries.
