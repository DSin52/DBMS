We extend earlier calculations of the one-loop contributions to the effectivebose Lagrangian in supergravity coupled to chiral matter. We evaluate alllogarithmically divergent contributions for arbitrary background scalar fieldsand space-time metric. We show that, with a judicious choice of gauge fixingand of the definition of the action expansion, much of the result can beabsorbed into a redefinition of the metric and a renormalization of theK\"ahler potential. Most of the remaining terms depend on the curvature of theK\"ahler metric. Further simplification occurs in models obtained fromsuperstrings in which the K\"ahler Riemann tensor is covariantly constant.
