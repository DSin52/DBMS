We investigate extensions of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra by one additionalsuper primary field and its charge conjugate. Using a supersymmetric covariantformalism we construct all N=2 super W-algebras up to spin 5/2 of theadditional generator. Led by these first examples we close with someconjectures on the classification of N=2 ${\cal SW}(1,\Dt)$ algebras.
