A previously proposed generalized BRST quantization on inner product spacesfor second class constraints is further developed through applications. ThisBRST method involves a conserved generalized BRST charge Q which is notnilpotent but which satisfies Q=\delta+\delta^{\dagger}, \delta^2=0, and bymeans of which physical states are obtained from the projection\delta|ph>=\delta^{\dagger}|ph>=0. A simple model is analyzed in detail fromwhich some basic properties and necessary ingredients are extracted. The methodis then applied to a massive vector field. An effective theory is derived whichis close to the one of the Stueckelberg model. However, since the scalar fieldhere is introduced in order to have inner product solutions, a massiveYang-Mills theory with polynomial interaction terms might be possible toconstruct.
