Exploring the role of conformal theories of gravity in string theory, we showthat the minimal (N=2) gauged supergravities in five dimensions induce themultiplets and transformations of N=1 four dimensional conformal supergravityon the spacetime boundary. N=1 Poincare supergravity can be induced byexplicitly breaking the conformal invariance via a radial cutoff in the 5dspace. The AdS/CFT correspondence relates the maximal gauged supergravity infive dimensions to N=4 super Yang-Mills on the 4d spacetime boundary. In thiscontext we show that the conformal anomaly of the gauge theory inducesconformal gravity on the boundary of the space and that this theory, via therenormalization group, encapsulates the gravitational dynamics of the skin ofasymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results have several applications to theAdS/CFT correspondence and the Randall-Sundrum scenario.
