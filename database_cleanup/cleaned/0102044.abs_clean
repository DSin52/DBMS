We investigate the quantization of the theta-expanded noncommutative U(1)Yang-Mills action, obtained via the Seiberg-Witten map. As expected we findnon-renormalizable terms. The one-loop propagator corrections are gaugeindependent, and lead us to a unique extention of the noncommutative classicalaction. We interpret our results as a requirement that also the trace innoncommutative field theory should be deformed.
