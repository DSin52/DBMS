We examine the occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation in bothnonrelativistic and relativistic systems with no self-interactions in a generalsetting. A simple condition for the occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensationcan be given if we adopt generalized $\zeta$-functions to define the quantumtheory. We show that the crucial feature governing Bose-Einstein condensationis the dimension $q$ associated with the continuous part of the eigenvaluespectrum of the Hamiltonian for nonrelativistic systems or the spatial part ofthe Klein-Gordon operator for relativistic systems. In either caseBose-Einstein condensation can only occur if $q\ge3$.
