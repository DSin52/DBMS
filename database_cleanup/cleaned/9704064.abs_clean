In this article we give a detailed discussion of the mass perturbation theoryof the massive Schwinger model. After discussing some general features andbriefly reviewing the exact solution of the massless case, we compute thevacuum energy density of the massive model and some related quantities. Wederive the Feynman rules of mass perturbation theory and discuss the exact$n$-point functions with the help of the Dyson-Schwinger equations. Further weidentify the stable and unstable bound states of the theory and compute somebound-state masses and decay widths. Finally we discuss scattering processes,where the resonances and particle production thresholds of the model areproperly taken into account by our methods.
