Authors: Kazuki Ohmori

Comments: 256 pages, 30 figures. This paper is based on master's thesis

submitted to Univ. of Tokyo. This article covers the works done before(previously called eq.(5.11)) have been correctedWe review the recent studies of tachyon condensation in string field theory.After introducing the open string field theory both for bosonic string and forsuperstring, we use them to examine the conjecture that the unstableconfigurations of the D-brane will decay into the `closed string vacuum'through the tachyon condensation. And we describe the attemps to construct alower dimensional bosonic D-brane as an unstable lump solution of the stringfield equation. We obtain exact results from another formulation, backgroundindependent open string field theory. We also discuss some other topics whichare related to tachyon condensation in string theory, such as the constructionof a D-brane as a noncommutative soliton and some field theory models. Thispaper is based on my master's thesis submitted to Department of Physics,Faculty of Science, University of Tokyo on January 2001.
