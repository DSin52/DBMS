Inhomogeneous quantum groups are shown to be an effective algebraic tool inthe study of integrable systems and to provide solutions equivalent to theBethe ansatz. The method is illustrated on the 1D Heisenberg ferromagnet whosesymmetry is shown to be the quantum Galilei group Gamma_q(1) here introduced.Both the single magnon and the s=1/2 bound states of n-magnons are completelydescribed by the algebra.
