A weak version of the cosmic censorship hypothesis is implemented as a set ofboundary conditions on exact semi-classical solutions of two-dimensionaldilaton gravity. These boundary conditions reflect low-energy matter from thestrong coupling region and they also serve to stabilize the vacuum of thetheory against decay into negative energy states. Information about low-energyincoming matter can be recovered in the final state but at high energy blackholes are formed and inevitably lead to information loss at the semi-classicallevel.
