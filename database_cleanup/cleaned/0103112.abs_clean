I summarize perturbative and non-perturbative field theory tests of theholographic correspondence between type IIB superstring on AdS_5xS^5 and N=4SYM theory. The holographic duality between D-instantons and YM instantons isbriefly described. Non renormalization of two- and three-point functions ofCPO's and their extremal and next-to-extremal correlators are then reviewed.Finally, partial non-renormalization of four-point functions of lowest CPO's isanalyzed in view of the interpretation of short distance logarithmic behavioursin terms of anomalous dimensions of unprotected operators.
