We test the validity of the Siegel gauge condition for the lump solution ofcubic open bosonic string field theory by checking the equations of motion ofthe string field components outside the Siegel gauge. At level (3,6)approximation, the linear and quadratic terms of the equations of motion ofthese fields are found to cancel within about 20%.
