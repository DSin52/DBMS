We study boundary reflection matrix for the quantum field theory defined on ahalf line using Feynman's perturbation theory. The boundary reflection matrixcan be extracted directly from the two-point correlation function. This enablesus to determine the boundary reflection matrix for affine Toda field theorywith the Neumann boundary condition modulo `a mysterious factor half'.
