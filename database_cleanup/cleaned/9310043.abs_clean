The $CP^{N-1}$ model is quantised in the generalised canonical formalism ofBatalin and Tyutin by converting the original second class system into firstclass. Operator ordering ambiguities present in the conventional quantisationscheme of Dirac are thereby avoided. The first class constraints, theinvolutive Hamiltonian and the BRST charge are explicitly computed. Thepartition function is defined and evaluated in the unitary gauge.
