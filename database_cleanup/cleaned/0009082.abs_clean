We study BPS solutions for a self-dual string and a neutral string inM5-brane worldvolume theory with constant three-form field. We furthergeneralize such solitons to superpose with a calibrated surface. We also studya traveling wave on a calibrated surface in the constant three-form fieldbackground.
