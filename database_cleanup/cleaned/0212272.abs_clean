We apply a universal normal Calabi-Yau algebra to the construction andclassification of compact complex $n$-dimensional spaces with SU(n) holonomyand their fibrations. This algebraic approach includes natural extensions ofreflexive weight vectors to higher dimensions and a `dual' construction basedon the Diophantine decomposition of invariant monomials. The latter providesrecurrence formulae for the numbers of fibrations of Calabi-Yau spaces inarbitrary dimensions, which we exhibit explicitly for some Weierstrass and K3examples.
