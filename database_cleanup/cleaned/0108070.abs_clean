We present a class of solvable SO(D) symmetric matrix models with D bosonicmatrices coupled to chiral fermions. The SO(D) symmetry is spontaneously brokendue to the phase of the fermion integral. This demonstrates the conjecturedmechanism for the dynamical generation of four-dimensional space-time in theIIB matrix model, which was proposed as a nonperturbative definition of typeIIB superstring theory in ten dimensions.
