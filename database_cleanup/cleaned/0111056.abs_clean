Title: UV-IR coupling in higher derivative gravity

Authors: Bob Holdom

Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures

We discuss the possible existence of new generic vacuum solutions ofRobertson-Walker form in higher derivative gravity theories in four dimensions.These solutions illustrate how a dynamical coupling between very low and veryhigh frequency modes can occur when the cosmological constant is small.
