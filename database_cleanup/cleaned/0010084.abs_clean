We argue that apart from the standard closed and open strings one mayconsider a third possibility that we call monodromic strings. The monodromicstring propagating on a target looks like an ordinary open string (a mappingfrom a segment to the target) but its space of states is isomorphic to that ofa closed string.It is shown that the monodromic strings naturally appear in T-dualizing closedstrings moving on simply connected targets. As a nontrivial topology changingexample we show that the monodromic strings on a compact Poisson-Lie group areT-dual to the standard closed strings propagating on the noncompact dual PLgroup.
