By assuming the existence of a novel multipronged string state forD-particles interacting with D-brane intersections in type IIA string theory,we are able to derive a quantum mechanical description of supersymmetricReissner-Nordstrom black holes. A supersymmetric index calculation providesevidence for this conjecture. The quantum mechanical system becomes twodecoupled conformal quantum mechanical systems in the low energy limit. Theconformal quantum mechanics has expected properties of a dual description ofstring theory on $AdS_2\times S^2$.
