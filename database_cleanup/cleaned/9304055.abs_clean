We investigate the dependence of the gauge couplings on the dilaton field instring effective theories at the one--loop level. First we resolve thediscrepancies between statements based on symmetry considerations and explicitcalculations in string effective theories on this subject. A calculation of therelevant one--loop scattering amplitudes in string theory gives us furtherinformation and allows us to derive the exact form of the correspondingeffective Lagrangian. In particular there is no dilaton dependent one--loopcorrection to the holomorphic $f$--function arising from massive string modesin the loop. In addition we address the coupling of the antisymmetric tensorfield to the gauge bosons at one--loop. While the string S--matrix elements arenot reproduced using the usual supersymmetric Lagrangian with the chiralsuperfield representation for the dilaton field, the analogue Lagrangian withthe dilaton in a linear multiplet naturally gives the correct answer.
