We present plane-wave-type solutions of the lowest order superstringeffective action which have unbroken space-time supersymmetries. They describedilaton, axion and gauge fields in a stringy generalization of the Brinkmannmetric. Some conspiracy between the metric and the axion field is required. Weshow that there exists a special class of these solutions, for which$\alpha^\prime$ stringy corrections to the effective on-shell action, to theequations of motion (and therefore to the solutions themselves), and to thesupersymmetry transformations vanish. We call these solutions supersymmetricstring waves (SSW).
