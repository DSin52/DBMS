Title: Smooth ``creation'' of an open universe in five dimensions

Comments: 8 pages

We present a non-singular instanton describing the creation of an openuniverse with a compactified extra dimension. The four dimensional section ofthis solution is a singular instanton of the type introduced by Hawking andTurok. The ``singularity'' is viewed in five dimensions as a smooth bubble of``nothing'' which eats up a portion of spacetime as it expands. Flat space witha compact extra dimension is shown to be gravitationally metastable, butsufficiently long lived if the size of the extra dimension is large comparedwith the Planck length.
