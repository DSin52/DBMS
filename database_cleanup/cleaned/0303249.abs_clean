Gravity may be "locally localized" over a wide range of length scales on ad-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) brane living inside AdS_{d+1}. In this paperwe examine this phenomenon from the point of view of the holographic dual"defect conformal field theory". The mode expansion of bulk fields on thegravity side is shown to be precisely dual to the "boundary operator productexpansion" of operators as they approach the defect. From the field theorypoint of view, the condition for localization is that a "reduced operator"appearing in this expansion acquires negative anomalous dimension. Inparticular, a very light localized graviton exists when a mode arising from thereduction of the ambient stress-energy tensor to the defect has conformaldimension Delta ~ d-1. The part of the stress tensor containing the defectdynamics has dimension Delta = d-1 in the free theory, but we argue that itacquires an anomalous dimension in the interacting theory, and hence does notparticipate in localization in the regime of small backreaction of the brane.We demonstrate that such an anomalous dimension is consistent with theconservation of the full stress-energy tensor. Finally, we analyze how tocompute the anomalous dimensions of reduced operators from gravity at leadingorder in the interactions with the brane.
