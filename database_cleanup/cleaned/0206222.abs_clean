We argue that states with nontrivial horizontal charges of BTZ black hole canbe excited by ordinary falling matter including Hawking radiation. The mattereffect does not break the integrability condition of the charges on thehorizon. Thus we are able to trace the proccesses in which the matter imprintsthe information on the horizon by use of the charged states. It is naturallyexpected that in the thermal equilibrium with the Hawking radiation the blackhole wanders ergodically through different horizontal states due to thermalfluctuation of incoming matter. This fact strengthens plausibility of the basicpart of Carlip's idea. We also discuss some aspects of the quantum horizontalsymmetry and conjecture how the precise black hole entropy will be given fromour point of view.
