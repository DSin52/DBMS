Title: Let the spin and the charges unify

Comments: 9 pages, Latex

In space of d ordinary and d Grassmann coordinates, with d \ge 15, themanifests under certain conditions as SO(1,3) (in d=4 subspace) times SO(10)\supset SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) (in the rest of the space),accordingly the symmetry group of the S- matrix, which is approximatellyunitary in d=4 ordinary subspace, manifests as the direct product of thePoincar\'e group in d=4 subspace and the group describing charges.
