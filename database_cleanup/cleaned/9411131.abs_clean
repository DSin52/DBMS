A residue-theoretic representation is given for massless matter fields in(quotients) of (weighted) \CY\ complete intersection models and thecorresponding chiral operators in \LGO{s}.The well known polynomial deformations are thus generalized and the universalbut somewhat abstract Koszul computations acquire a concrete realization and ageneral but more heuristic reinterpretation.A direct correspondence with a BRST-type analysis of constrained systems alsoemerges naturally.
