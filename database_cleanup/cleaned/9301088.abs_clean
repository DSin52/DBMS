Authors: N.P. Warner

Comments: 37 pages, harvmac, USC-93/001

These lectures review some of the basic properties of $N=2$ superconformalfield theories and the corresponding topological field theories. One of mybasic aims is to show how the techniques of topological field theory can beused to compute effective \LG potentials for perturbed $N=2$ superconformalfield theories. In particular, I will briefly discuss the application of theseideas to $N=2$ supersymmetric quantum integrable models.
