We analyze the microscopic, topological structure of the interface betweendomains of opposite magnetization in 3D Ising model near the critical point.This interface exhibits a fractal behaviour with a high density of handles. Themean area is an almost linear function of the genus. The entropy exponent isaffected by strong finite-size effects.
