We study the relation between intersecting NS5-branes whose intersection issmoothed out and the deformed conifold in terms of the supergravity solution.We solve the condition of preserved supersymmetry on a metric inspired by thedeformed conifold metric and obtain a solution of the NS5-branes which isdelocalized except for one of the overall transverse directions. The solutionhas consistent properties with other configurations obtained by stringdualities.
