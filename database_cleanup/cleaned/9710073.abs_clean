A complete definition of the cycles, on the auxiliary Riemann surface definedby Martinec and Warner for describing pure N=2 gauge theories with arbitrarygroup, is provided. The strong coupling monodromies around the vanishing cyclesare shown to arise from a set of dyons which becomes massless at thesingularities. It is shown how the correct weak coupling monodromies arereproduced and how the dyons have charges which are consistent with thespectrum that can be calculated at weak coupling using conventionalsemi-classical methods. In particular, the magnetic charges are co-root vectorsas required by the Dirac-Schwinger-Zwanziger quantization condition.
