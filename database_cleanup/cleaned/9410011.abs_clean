In this paper we discuss the connection on a space of $N=2$ TCFT's thatappears in the context of background (in)dependence. We formulate a family of{\it target space field theories} with a similar connection on it. Each theoryis a gauge theory (with the gauge group being ${\cal SD}iff $ in the case of$3$-fold). It describes deformations of K\"ahler structures much like KodairaSpencer theory describes deformations of the complex structures. It ismanifestly background independent. It appears to be a target space field theoryfor supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
