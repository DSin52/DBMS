We continue our study of non-Abelian gauge theories in the framework ofEpstein-Glaser approach to renormalisation theory. We consider the case whenmassive spin-one Bosons are present into the theory and we modify appropriatelythe analysis of the origin of gauge invariance performed in a preceding paperin the case of null-mass spin-one Bosons. Then we are able to extend a resultof D\"utsch and Scharf concerning the uniqueness of the standard modelconsistent with renormalisation theory. In fact we consider the most generalcase i.e. the consistent interaction of $r$ spin-one Bosons and we do notimpose any restriction on the gauge group and the mass spectrum of the theory.We show that, beside the natural emergence of a group structure (like in themassless case) we obtain, new conditions of group-theoretical nature, namelythe existence of a certain representation of the gauge group associated to theHiggs fields. Some other mass relations connecting the structure constants ofthe gauge group and the masses of the Bosons emerge naturally. The proof isdone using Epstein-Glaser approach to renormalisation theory.
