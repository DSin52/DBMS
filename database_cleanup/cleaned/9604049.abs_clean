A finite expansion of the exponential map for a $N\times N$ matrix ispresented. The method uses the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for writing the highermatrix powers in terms of the first N-1 ones. The resulting sums over thecorresponding coefficients are rational functions of the eigenvalues of thematrix.
