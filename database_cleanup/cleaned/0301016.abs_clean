Title: 3d Conformal Higher Spin Symmetry in 2+1 Dimensional Matter Systems

Authors: O.V. Shaynkman

Comments: Report given at III Sakharov Conference on Physics in Moscow; 8 pages

The symmetry algebra of massless fields living on the 3-dimensional conformalboundary of AdS(4) is shown to be isomorphic to 3d conformal higher spinalgebra (AdS(4) higher spin algebra). A simple realization of this algebra onthe free flat 3d massless matter fields is given in terms of an auxiliary Fockmodule.
