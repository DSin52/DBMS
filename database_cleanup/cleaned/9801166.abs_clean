We study Witten's proposal that a domain wall exists in M-theory fivebraneversion of QCD (MQCD) and that it can be represented as a supersymmetricthree-cycle in G_2 holonomy manifold. It is shown that equations defining theU(1) invariant domain wall for SU(2) group can be reduced to the Monge-Ampereequation. A proof of an algebraic formula of Kaplunovsky, Sonnenschein andYankielowicz is presented. The formal solution of equations for domain wall isconstructed.
