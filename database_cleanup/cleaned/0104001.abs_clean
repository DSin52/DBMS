We consider in detail how the quantum-mechanical tunneling phenomenon occursin a well-behaved octic potential. Our main tool will be the euclideanpropagator just evaluated between two minima of the potential at issue. Forsuch a purpose we resort to the standard semiclassical approximation whichtakes into account the fluctuations over the instantons, i.e. the finite-actionsolutions of the euclidean equation of motion. As regards the one-instantonapproach, the functional determinant associated with the so-called stabilityequation is analyzed in terms of the asymptotic behaviour of the zero-mode. Theconventional ratio of determinants takes as reference the harmonic oscillatorwhose frequency is the average of the two different frequencies derived fromthe minima of the potential involved in the computation. The second instantonof the model is studied in a similar way. The physical effects of themulti-instanton configurations are included in this context by means of thealternate dilute-gas approximation where the two instantons participate toprovide us with the final expression of the propagator.
