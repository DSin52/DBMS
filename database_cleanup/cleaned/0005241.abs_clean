Workshop 2000, May 13-14, IRANThe possibility of using the quantum mechanics of D0-branes for thebound-states of quarks and QCD strings is investigated. Issues such as theinter D0-branes potential, the whiteness of the D0-branes bound-states and thelarge-N limit of D0-branes effective theory are studied. A possible role of thenon-commutativity of relative distances of D0-branes in a study of ordinary QCDis discussed.
