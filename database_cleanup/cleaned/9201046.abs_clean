The classical motion of a test string in the transverse space of two types ofheterotic fivebrane sources is fully analyzed, for arbitrary instanton scalesize. The singular case is treated as a special case and does not arise in thecontinuous limit of zero instanton size. We find that the orbits are eithercircular or open, which is a solitonic analogy with the motion of an electronaround a magnetic monopole, although the system we consider is quantitativelydifferent. We emphasize that at long distance this geometry does not satisfythe inverse square law, but satisfies the inverse cubic law. If the fivebraneexists in nature and this structure survives after any proper compactification,this last result can be used to test classical ``stringy'' effects.
