The problem of asymptotic density of quantum states of fundamental extendedobjects is revised in detail. We argue that in the near-extremal regime thefundamental $p$-brane approach can yield a microscopic interpretation of theblack hole entropy. The asymptotic behavior of partition functions, associatedwith the $p$-branes, and the near-extremal entropy of five-dimensional blackholes are explicitly calculated.
