Title: New Scaling Limit for Fuzzy Spheres

Authors: S. Vaidya and B. Ydri

Comments: 6 pages, latex

Using a new scaling and a cut-off procedure, we show that phi^4 theory on adeformed noncommutative R^4 can be obtained from the corresponding theory onthe fuzzy S^2 \times S^2. The star-product on this deformed noncommutative R^4is non-associative, and the theory naturally has an ultra-violet cut-off,Lambda = 2/\theta. We show that UV-IR mixing is absent to one loop, and thatthe beta-function is the same as that of an ordinary phi^4 theory.
