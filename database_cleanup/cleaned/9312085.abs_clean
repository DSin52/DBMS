The exact general solution for a sigma model having the $2-d$ stringy blackhole (SBH) as internal manifold is found in closed form. We also give the exactsolution for the massless complex Sine-Gordon (MCSG) model. Both, models andtheir solutions are related by analytic continuation. The solution is expressedin terms of four arbitrary functions of one variable. (hep-th 9312085).
