Title: Recent Progress in Irrational Conformal Field Theory

Authors: M.B. Halpern

Comments: 16 pages, Latex, UCB-PTH-93/25, LBL-34610, talk presented at the

conference "Strings 1993", Berkeley, May 23-29In this talk, I will review the foundations of irrational conformal fieldtheory (ICFT), which includes rational conformal field theory as a smallsubspace. Highlights of the review include the Virasoro master equation, theWard identities for the correlators of ICFT and solutions of the Wardidentities. In particular, I will discuss the solutions for the correlators ofthe $g/h$ coset constructions and the correlators of the affine-Sugawara nestson $g\supset h_1 \supset \ldots \supset h_n$. Finally, I will discuss therecent global solution for the correlators of all the ICFT's in the masterequation.
