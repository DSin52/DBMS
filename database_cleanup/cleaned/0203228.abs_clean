We present a new class of hermitian one-matrix models originated in thegenerators in their fermionic bilinear form are shown to expand the orthogonalbasis of a class of random hermitian matrix models. The correspondingpotentials are given, and the thermodynamic limit interpreted in terms of asimple plasma picture. The new matrix models can be successfully applied to thefull bosonization of interesting one-dimensional systems, including all theperturbative orders in the inverse size of the system. As a simple application,we present the all-order bosonization of the free fermionic field on theone-dimensional lattice.
