We study the vacuum partition functional Z [J] for a system of closed,dimension. We suggest an extension of the duality transformation which can beapplied to the limiting case even though no dual gauge potential exists in theconventional sense. The dual action thus obtained describes a current-current,static interaction within the bulk volume bounded by the d-1-brane. Guided bythese results, we then construct a general expression for the parent Lagrangianthat allows for a unified treatment of p-duality, even in the presence ofexternal currents, using a first order formalism instead of the Bianchiidentities. Finally, we show how this generalized dualization approach canaccommodate the inclusion of a massive topological term in the parent action ofan Abelian gauge theory.
