The thermodynamic free energy F(\beta) is calculated for a gas consisting ofthe transverse oscillations of a piecewise uniform bosonic string. The stringconsists of 2N parts of equal length, of alternating type I and type IImaterial, and is relativistic in the sense that the velocity of soundeverywhere equals the velocity of light. The present paper is a continuation oftwo earlier papers, one dealing with the Casimir energy of a 2N--piece string[I. Brevik and R. Sollie (1997)], and another dealing with the thermodynamicproperties of a string divided into two (unequal) parts [I. Brevik, A. A.Bytsenko and H. B. Nielsen (1998)]. Making use of the Meinardus theorem wecalculate the asymptotics of the level state density, and show that thecritical temperatures in the individual parts are equal, for arbitraryspacetime dimension D. If D=26, we find \beta= (2/N)\sqrt{2\pi /T_{II}}, T_{II}being the tension in part II. Thermodynamic interactions of parts related tohigh genus g is also considered.
