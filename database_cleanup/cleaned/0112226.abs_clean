One of the remarkable outcomes of the AdS/CFT correspondence has been thegeneralization of Cardy's entropy formula for arbitrary dimensionality, as wellas a variety of anti-de Sitter scenarios. More recently, related work has beendone in the realm of asymptotically de Sitter backgrounds. Such studies presumea well-defined dS/CFT duality, which has not yet attained the credibility ofits AdS analogue. In this paper, we derive and interpret generalized forms ofthe Cardy entropy for a selection of asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. Theseinclude the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole (as a review of hep-th/0112093),the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black hole and a special class of topologicalde Sitter solutions. Each of these cases is found to have interestingimplications in the context of the proposed correspondence.
