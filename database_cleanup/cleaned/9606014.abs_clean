The property of some finite W-algebras to appear as the commutant of aparticular subalgebra in a simple Lie algebra G is exploited for the obtentionof new G-realizations from a "canonical" differential one.The method is applied to the conformal algebra so(4,2) and therefore yieldsalso results for its Poincare subalgebra. Unitary irreducible representationsof these algebras are recognized in this approach, which is naturally compared
