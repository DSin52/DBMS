Relation between the vacuum eigenvalues of CFT Q-operators and spectraldeterminants of one-dimensional Schroedinger operator with homogeneouspotential, recently conjectured by Dorey and Tateo for special value ofVirasoro vacuum parameter p, is proven to hold, with suitable modification ofthe Schroedinger operator, for all values of p.
