1996This is a summary of the analysis of the one-loop effective action inZ_2-orbifold compactifications of type-I theory presented in references [1,2].We show how, for non-abelian group factors, the threshold effects areultraviolet finite though given entirely by a six-dimensional field theoryexpression. We also discuss implications for the equivalence between Type-I andHeterotic four dimensional N=2 superstring theories.
