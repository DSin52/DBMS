Title: Interacting Spinors-Scalars and AdS/CFT Correspondence

Authors: A.M. Ghezelbash, K. Kaviani, S. Parvizi, A.H. Fatollahi

Comments: The crucial role of the surface term in the action to generate the

correlation functions quadratic in spinors is considered. LaTeX file, 8 pagesJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B435 (1998) 291-298

By taking the interacting spinor-scalar theory on the $AdS_{d+1}$ space wecalculate the boundary CFT correlation functions using AdS/CFT correspondence.
