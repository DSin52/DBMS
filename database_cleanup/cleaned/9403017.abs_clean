It is shown that $D=4$ $N=1$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with an appropriatesupermultiplet of matter can be twisted on compact K\"ahler manifold. Theconditions of cancellation of anomalies of BRST charge are found. The twistedtheory has an appropriate BRST charge. We find a non-trivial set of physicaloperators defined as classes of the cohomology of this BRST \op . We prove thatthe physical correlators are independent on external K\"ahler metric up to apower of a ratio of two Ray-Singer torsions for the Dolbeault cohomologycomplex on a K\"ahler manifold. The correlators of local physical \op s turnout to be independent of anti-holomorphic coordinates defined with a complexstructure on the K\"ahler manifold. However a dependence of the correlators onholomorphic coordinates can still remain. For a hyperk\"ahler metric thephysical correlators turn out to be independent of all coordinates ofinsertions of local physical \op s.
