We obtain three and four dimensional conformal field theories with less thanmaximal supersymmetry by using their supergravity duals. These supergravitytheories are type II on $AdS_5 \times CP^2$, IIA on $AdS_4 \times CP^3$, IIB on$AdS_5 \times S^5/Z_k$ and D=11 supergravity on $AdS_4 \times S^7/Z_k$. Theyare obtained from the spherically compactified ten and eleven dimensionaltheories by either Hopf reduction or by winding the U(1) fiber over the base.
