The large spacing phase of the infinite random matrix chain, which representsthe strongly coupled two-dimensional O(2) model on a random planar lattice, isexplored. A class of solutions valid for large lattice spacings is constructed.It is proved that these solutions exhibit the critical exponents characteristicof pure two-dimensional gravity. The character expansion for the chain model isdeveloped and an order parameter governing the Kosterlitz--Thouless phasetransition is identified.
