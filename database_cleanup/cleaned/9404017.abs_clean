Departamento de F\ii sica and Matem\'aticas Aplicadas, No. 02 (1994)A two-dimensional generalized oscillator with time-dependent parameters isconsidered to study the two-mode squeezing phenomena. Specific choices of theparameters are used to determine the dispersion matrix and analyticexpressions, in terms of standard hermite polynomials, of the wavefunctions andphoton distributions.
