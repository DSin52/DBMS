The boundary effects in the screening of an applied magnetic field in afinite temperature 2+1 dimensional model of charged fermions minimally coupledto Maxwell and Chern-Simons fields are investigated. It is found that in asample with only one boundary -a half-plane- a total Meissner effect takesplace, while in a sample with two boundaries -an infinite strip- the externalmagnetic field partially penetrates the material.
