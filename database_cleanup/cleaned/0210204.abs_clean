It is shown how in principle for non-abelian gauge theories it is possible inthe finite volume hamiltonian framework to make sense of calculating theexpectation value of ||A||^2=\int d^3x(A^a_i(x))^2. Gauge invariance requiresone to replace ||A||^2 by its minimum over the gauge orbit, which makes it ahighly non-local quantity. We comment on the difficulty of finding a gaugeinvariant expression for ||A||^2_{min} analogous to that found for the abeliancase, and the relation of this question to Gribov copies. We deal with theseissues by implementing the hamiltonian on the so-called fundamental domain,with appropriate boundary conditions in field space, essential to correctlyrepresent the physics of the problem.
