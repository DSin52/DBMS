The induced 4d gravity on a brane world is analyzed. The case of a thickbrane is considered and the unexpected appearance of a new threshold scale,much larger than the thickness scale is found. In cases of phenomenologicalinterest, this new length scale turns out to be in the submillimeter range. Theeffect of $R^2$ corrections, both in the bulk and on the brane, is alsostudied. It is shown that they introduce new threshold scales and may inducedrastic modifications to the leading behavior. A concrete string/D-branerealization of the induced gravity scenario is also presented.
