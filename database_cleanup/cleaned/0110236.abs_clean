We show that the correspondence between SU(5) monopoles and the elementaryparticles, which underlies the construction of a dual standard model, has somesimpler analogues associated with the strong, weak and hyperchargeinteractions. We then discuss how these analogues relate to Bais'generalization of the Montenon-Olive conjecture and find the representations ofthe monopoles under the dual gauge group; these representations agree withthose of the elementary particles.
