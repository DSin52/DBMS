We study a vacuum polarization effect in the background of certain dilatonicextremal black hole, known as the cornucopion. Whenever the charged fermionsare of any finite mass, the gravitational backreaction to a generic value of a$CP$ nonconserving vacuum angle $\theta$ is shown to be important owing to avacuum energy density which does not vanish deep inside the cornucopion. Whenthis energy density is positive, this effect creates an extremal horizon atfinite physical distance, closing off the infinite neck. We study the geometrynear this horizon in some detail and find different physical interpretationsfor small and large fermion mass. Also, we argue that the conclusion isqualitatively correct despite the strong coupling.
