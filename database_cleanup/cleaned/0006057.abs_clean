The one-loop effective action of QED obtained by Euler and Heisenberg and bySchwinger has been expressed by an asymptotic perturbative series which isdivergent. In this letter we present a non-perturbative but convergent seriesof the effective action. With the convergent series we establish the existenceof the manifest electric-magnetic duality in the one loop effective action ofQED.
