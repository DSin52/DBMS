In this letter we show that the ``preferred'' Klein-Gordon Quantum FieldTheories (QFT's) on a d-dimensional de Sitter spacetime can be obtained from aKlein-Gordon QFT on a (d+1)-dimensional ``ambient'' Minkowski spacetimesatisfying the spectral condition and, conversely, that a Klein-Gordon QFT on a(d+1)-dimensional ``ambient'' Minkowski spacetime satisfying the spectralcondition can be obtained as superposition of d-dimensional de SitterKlein-Gordon fields in the preferred vacuum. These results establish acorrespondence between QFT's living on manifolds having different dimensions.The method exposed here can be applied to study other situations and notablyQFT on Anti de Sitter spacetime.
