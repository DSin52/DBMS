We show that certain classes of K3 fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds derive fromorbifolds of global products of K3 surfaces and particular types of curves.This observation explains why the gauge groups of the heterotic duals aredetermined by the structure of a single K3 surface and provides the dualheterotic picture of conifold transitions between K3 fibrations. Abstractingour construction from the special case of K3 hypersurfaces to general K3manifolds with an appropriate automorphism, we show how to construct Calabi-Yauthreefold duals for heterotic theories with arbitrary gauge groups. Thisgeneralization reveals that the previous limit on the Euler number ofCalabi-Yau manifolds is an artifact of the restriction to the framework ofhypersurfaces.
