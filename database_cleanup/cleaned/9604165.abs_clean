We formulate a conjecture for the three different Lax operators that describethe bosonic sectors of the three possible $N=2$ supersymmetric integrablehierarchies with $N=2$ super $W_n$ second hamiltonian structure. We check thisconjecture in the simplest cases, then we verify it in general in one of thethree possible supersymmetric extensions. To this end we construct the $N=2$supersymmetric extensions of the Generalized Non-Linear Schr\"{o}dingerhierarchy by exhibiting the corresponding super Lax operator. To find thecorrect hamiltonians we are led to a new definition of super-residues fordegenerate N=2 supersymmetric pseudodifferential operators. We have found a newnon-polinomial Miura-like realization for $N=2$ superconformal algebra in termsof two bosonic chiral--anti--chiral free superfields.
