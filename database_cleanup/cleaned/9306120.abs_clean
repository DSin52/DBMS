We give a prescription for embedding classical solutions and, in particular,topological defects in field theories which are invariant under symmetry groupsthat are not necessarily simple. After providing examples of embedded defectsin field theories based on simple groups, we consider the electroweak model andshow that it contains the $Z$ string and a one parameter family of stringscalled the $W(\alpha )$ string. It is argued that, although the members of thisfamily are gauge equivalent when considered in isolation, each member should beconsidered distinct when multi-string solutions are considered. We then turn tothe issue of stability of embedded defects and demonstrate the instability of alarge class of such solutions in the absence of bound states or condensates.The $Z$ string is shown to be unstable when the Weinberg angle ($\theta_w$) is$\pi /4$ for all values of the Higgs mass. The $W$ strings are also shown to beunstable for a large range of parameters. Embedded monopoles suffer from theBrandt-Neri-Coleman instability. A simple physical understanding of thisinstability is provided in terms of the phenomenon of W-condensation. Finally,of W string and finite segments of W and Z strings collapse into the sphaleronconfiguration, at least, for small values of $\theta_w$.
