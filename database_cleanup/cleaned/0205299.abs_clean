In this article we extend previous work by the authors, and elaborate furtheron the structure of the general solution to the graviton and dilaton equationsof motion in brane world scenaria, in the context of five-dimensional effectiveactions with O(\alpha ')$ higher-curvature corrections, compatible with bulkstring-amplitude calculations. We consider (multi)brane scenaria, dividing thebulk space into regions, in which one matches two classes of general solutions,a linear Randall-Sundrum solution and a (logarithmic) dilatonic domain wall(bulk naked singularity).We pay particular attention to examining thepossibility of resolving the mass hierarchy problem together with the vanishingof the vacuum energy on the observable world, which is taken to be a positivetension brane. The appearance of naked dilatonic domain walls provides adynamical restriction of the bulk space time. Of particular interest is adilatonic-wall solution, which after appropriate coordinate transformation,results in a linear dilaton conformal field theory. The latter may provide aholographic resolution of the naked singularity problem. All thestring-inspired models involved have the generic feature that the branetensions are proportional to the string coupling $g_s$; it remains a challengefor string theory, therefore, to show whether microscopic models respectingthis feature can be constructed.
