We show that the strong coupling phase of the non-Abelian Thirring model isdual to the weak-coupling phase of a system of two WZNW models coupled to eachother through a current-current interaction. This latter system is integrableand is related to a perturbed conformal field theory which, in the large $|k|$limit, has a nontrivial zero of the perturbation-parameter beta-function. Thenon-Abelian Thirring model reduces to a free fermion theory plus a topologicalfield theory at this critical point, which should therefore be identified withthe isoscalar Dashen-Frishman conformal point. The relationship with theGross-Neveu model is discussed.
