We introduce lattice models with explicit N=2 supersymmetry. In theseinteracting models, the supersymmetry generators Q^+ and Q^- yield theHamiltonian H={Q^+,Q^-} on any graph. The degrees of freedom can be describedas either fermions with hard cores, or as quantum dimers. The Hamiltonian ofour simplest model contains a hopping term and a repulsive potential, as wellas the hard-core repulsion. We discuss these models from a variety ofBethe ansatz, and using cohomology methods. The simplest model provides amanifestly-supersymmetric lattice regulator for the supersymmetric point of themassless 1+1-dimensional Thirring (Luttinger) model. We discuss theground-state structure of this same model on more complicated graphs, includinga 2-leg ladder, and discuss some generalizations.
