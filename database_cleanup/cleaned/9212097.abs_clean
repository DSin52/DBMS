Using a Laurent series representation for the (super)string one-loop freeenergy, an explicit form for the analytic continuation of the Laurent seriesbeyond the critical (Hagedorn) temperature is obtained. As an additionalresult, a periodic structure is found in (super)string thermodynamics. A briefphysical discussion about the origin and meaning of such structure is carriedout.
