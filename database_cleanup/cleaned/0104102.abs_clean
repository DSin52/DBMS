We show that a string-inspired Planck scale modification of generalrelativity can have observable cosmological effects. Specifically, we present acomplete analysis of the inflationary perturbation spectrum produced by aphenomenological Lagrangian that has a standard form on large scales butincorporates a string-inspired short distance cutoff, and find a deviation fromthe standard result. We use the de Sitter calculation as the basis of aqualitative analysis of other inflationary backgrounds, arguing that in thesecases the cutoff could have a more pronounced effect, changing the shape of thespectrum. Moreover, the computational approach developed here can be used toprovide unambiguous calculations of the perturbation spectrum in otherheuristic models that modify trans-Planckian physics and thereby determinetheir impact on the inflationary perturbation spectrum. Finally, we argue thatthis model may provide an exception to constraints, recently proposed by Tanakaand Starobinsky, on the ability of Planck-scale physics to modify thecosmological spectrum.
