We study the Gepner model description of D-branes in Calabi-Yau manifoldswith singular curves. From a geometrical point of view, the resolution ofsingularities leads to additional homology cycles around which branes can wrap.Using techniques from conformal field theory we address the construction ofboundary states for branes wrapping additional 3-cycles on the resolvedCalabi-Yau manifold. Explicit formulas are provided for Z_2 singular curves.
