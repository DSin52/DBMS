We consider Quantum Toda theory associated to a general Lie algebra. We provethat the conserved quantities in both conformal and affine Toda theoriesexhibit duality interchanging the Dynkin diagram and its dual, and invertingthe coupling constant. As an example we discuss the conformal Toda theoriesbased on $B_2,B_3$ and $G_2$ and the related affine theories.
