Title: The Wave Function of a Collapsing Star and Quantization Conditions

Authors: Yoav Peleg

Comments: 13 pages, BRX-TH-342

A very simple minisuperspace describing the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapsingstar is found. The semiclasical wave function of that model turn out todescribe a bound state. For fixed initial radius of the collapsing star, thecorrssponding Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition implies mass quantization.An extension of this model, and some consequences, are considered.
