The SO(32) theory, in the limit where it is an open superstring theory, iscompletely specified in the light-cone gauge as a second-quantized stringtheory in terms of a ``matrix string'' model. The theory is defined by theneighbourhood of a 1+1 dimensional fixed point theory, characterized by anAbelian gauge theory with type IB Green-Schwarz form. Non-orientability andSO(32) gauge symmetry arise naturally, and the theory effectively constructs anorientifold projection of the (weakly coupled) matrix type IIB theory (alsodiscussed herein). The fixed point theory is a conformal field theory withboundary, defining the free string theory. Interactions involving the interiorof open and closed strings are governed by a twist operator in the bulk, whilestring end-points are created and destroyed by a boundary twist operator.
