Title: Status of the Kazakov--Migdal Model

Comments: 13 Pages, Using REVTEX macros. Talk presented at Quarks '94 May 1994,

Vladimir, RussiaIn this talk I discuss both the present status and some recent work on theKazakov--Migdal Model which was originally proposed as a soluble, large $N$realization of QCD. After a brief description of the model and a discussion ofits solubility in the large $N$ limit I discuss several of the serious problemswith the model which lead to the conclusion that it does {\it not} induce QCD.The model is nonetheless a very interesting example of a Gauge Theory and it isrelated to some very interesting Matrix Models. I then outline a technique\REF\dmsxyz{\dms}\refend which uses ``Loop Equations'' for solving such models.A Penner--like model is then discussed with two logarithmic singularities. Thismodel is distinguished by the fact that it is exactly and explicitly soluble inspite of the fact that it is not Gaussian. It is shown how to analyze thismodel using both a technical approach and from a more physical point of view.
