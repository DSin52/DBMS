Based on hep-th/0207238A universal symmetric truncation of the bosonic string Hilbert space yieldsall known closed fermionic string theories in ten dimensions, their D-branesand their open descendants. We highlight the crucial role played by grouptheory and two-dimensional conformal field theory in the construction andemphasize the predictive power of the truncation. Such circumstantial evidencepoints towards the existence of a mechanism which generates space-time fermionsout of bosons dynamically within the framework of bosonic string theory.
