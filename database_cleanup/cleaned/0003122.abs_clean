By explicit evaluation of certain disk S-matrix elements in the presence ofbackground B-flux, we find coupling of two open string tachyons to gauge field,graviton, dilaton or Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor on the world-volume of asingle non-BPS D$p$-brane. We then propose an extension of the abelianDirac-Born-Infeld action which naturally reproduces these couplings in fieldtheory. This action includes non-linearly the dynamics of the tachyon fieldmuch like the other bosonic modes of the non-BPS D$p$-brane. On the generalgrounds of gauge and T-duality transformations and the symmetrized traceprescription, we then extend the abelian action to non-abelian cases.
