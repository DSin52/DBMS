Spacetime superalgebras with 64 or less number of real supercharges,containing the type IIB Poincare superalgebra in (9,1) dimensions and the N=1Poincare superalgebra in (10,1) are considered. The restriction D<14, and twoand the N=(2,0) superalgebra in (10,2) dimensions. Emphasizing the former, wedescribe superparticle and super Yang-Mills systems in (11,3) dimensions. Wealso propose an N=(2,1) superstring theory in (n,n) dimensions as a possibleorigin of super Yang-Mills in (8+n,n) dimensions.
