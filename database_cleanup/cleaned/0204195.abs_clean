We consider non-supersymmetric quiver theories obtained by orbifolding theN=4 supersymmetric U(K) gauge theory by a discrete Z_\Gamma group embedded inthe SU(4) R-symmetry group. We explicitly find that in such theories there areno one-loop quadratic divergences in the effective potential.Moreover, when the gauge group U(n)^\Gamma of the quiver theory isspontaneously broken down to the diagonal U(n), we identify a custodialsupersymmetry which is responsible for the fermion-boson degeneracy of the massspectrum.
