We show that there is a non-trivial relationship between the dilaton of IIBsupergravity, and the coset of scalar fields in five-dimensional, gauged N=8supergravity. This has important consequences for the running of the gaugecoupling in massive perturbations of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We conjecturean exact analytic expression for the ten-dimensional dilaton in terms offive-dimensional quantities, and we test this conjecture. Specifically, weconstruct a family of solutions to IIB supergravity that preserve half of thesupersymmetries, and are lifts of supersymmetric flows in five-dimensional,gauged N=8 supergravity. Via the AdS/CFT correspondence these flows correspondto softly broken N=4, large N Yang-Mills theory on part of the Coulomb branchof N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills. Our solutions involve non-trivial backgroundsfor all the tensor gauge fields as well as for the dilaton and axion.
