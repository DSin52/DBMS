Title: Decreasing "circumference" for increasing "radius" in axially symmetric

gravitating systemsAuthors: M.Lubo

Comments: 15 pages, 7 figures

Apart from the flat space with an angular deficit, Einstein generalrelativity possesses another cylindrically symmetric solution. Because thisconfiguration displays circles whose "circumferences" tend to zero when their"radius" go to infinity, it has not received much attention in the past. Wepropose a geometric interpretation of this feature and find that it impliesfield boundary conditions different from the ones found in the literature ifone considers a source consisting of the scalar and the vector fields of a U(1)system . To obtain a non increasing energy density the gauge symmetry must beunbroken . For the Higgs potential this is achieved only with a vanishingvacuum expectation value but then the solution has a null scalar field. A nontrivial scalar behaviour is exhibited for a potential of sixth order. Thetrajectories of test particles in this geometry are studied, its causalstructure discussed. We find that this bosonic background can support anormalizable fermionic condensate but not such a current.
