$N=1 D=4$ supermembrane (in a flat background) and super D2-brane dual to itare described within the nonlinear realizations approach as theories of thepartial supersymmetry breaking $N=1 D=4 \to N=1 d=3$. We construct the relevantinvariant off-shell Goldstone superfield actions and demonstrate them to bedual to each other. Their bosonic cores are, respectively, the static-gaugeNambu-Goto and $d=3$ Born-Infeld actions. The supermembrane superfield equationof motion admits a transparent geometric interpretation suggesting an extensionof the standard superembedding constraints. We briefly discuss the 1/4 breakingof $N=1 D=5$ supersymmetry along similar lines.
