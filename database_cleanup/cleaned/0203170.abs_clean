Title: Depilating Global Charge From Thermal Black Holes

Authors: John March-Russell, Frank Wilczek

Comments: 7 pages, Latex

At a formal level, there appears to be no difficulty involved in introducinga chemical potential for a globally conserved quantum number into the partitionfunction for space-time including a black hole. Were this possible, however, itwould provide a form of black hole hair, and contradict the idea that globalquantum numbers are violated in black hole evaporation. We demonstratedynamical mechanisms that negate the formal procedure, both for topologicalcharge (Skyrmions) and complex scalar-field charge. Skyrmions collapse to thehorizon; scalar-field charge fluctuates uncontrollably.
