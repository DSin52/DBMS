Title: Universal Bundle, Generalized Russian Formula and Non-Abelian Anomaly in

Topological Yang-Mills TheoryAuthors: Jae-Suk Park

Comments: 16 pages, harvmac TeX, ESENAT-92-07, (TeXnical and stupid errors are

corrected.)We re-examine the geometry and algebraic structure of BRST's of TopologicalYang-Mills theory based on the universal bundle formalism of Atiyah and Singer.This enables us to find a natural generalization of the {\it Russian formulaand descent equations\/}, which can be used as algebraic method to find thenon-Abelian anomalies counterparts in Topological Yang-Mills theory. We suggestthat the presence of the non-Abelian anomaly obstructs the proper definition ofDonaldson's invariants.
