An exactly soluble non-perturbative model of the pure gauge QCD is derived asa weak coupling limit of the lattice theory in plaquette formulation. The modelrepresents QCD as a theory of the weakly interacting field strength fluxes. Thearea law behavior of the Wilson loop average is a direct result of thisthe weakness of the interaction) function of the elementary fluxes. Thecompactness of the gauge group is shown to be the factor which prevents theelementary fluxes contributions from cancellation. There is no area law in thenon-compact theory.
