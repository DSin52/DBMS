The master equation is quantized. This is an example of quantization of agauge theory with nilpotent generators. No ghosts are needed for a generationof the gauge algebra. The point about the nilpotent generators is that onecan't write down a single functional integral for this theory. One has to writedown a product of two coupled functional integrals and take a square root. Inthe special gauge where the gauge conditions are commuting, the functionalintegrals decouple, and one recovers the known result.
