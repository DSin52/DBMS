Title: Universal R-Matrix of Reductive Lie Algebras

Authors: A. Kundu and P. Truini

Comments: 5 pages

The aim of the paper is to build a universal R-matrix for the multiparameterdeformation of any reductive Lie algebra. Such deformations, formulated in therecent past by Truini and Varadarajan, have the property of universality in acertain class and are shown by the present paper to be quasitriangular Hopfalgebras. In order to build the R-matrix we exploit the twisting method forintroducing new parameters as well as for making the transition to thereductive case. The physical motivation behind this construction is in theassociated quantum R-matrix and Lax operators with spectral as well as colorparameters - the color parameters being provided by the eigenvalues of thecentral generators of the reductive Lie algebra in a given representation. Inthis letter we present only the explicit form of the universal R-matrix ofreductive Lie algebras and postpone its application to a forthcoming paper.
