We consider the classical equations of the Born-Infeld-Abelian-Higgs model(with and without coupling to gravity) in an axially symmetric ansatz. Anumerical analysis of the equations reveals that the (gravitating)Nielsen-Olesen vortices are smoothly deformed by the Born-Infeld interaction,characterized by a coupling constant $\beta^2$, and that these solutions ceaseto exist at a critical value of $\beta^2$. When the critical value isapproached, the length of the magnetic field on the symmetry axis becomesinfinite.
