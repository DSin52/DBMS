We consider Chern-Simons gauge theory on a torus with both nonrelativisticand relativistic matter. It is shown that the Hamiltonian and two total momentacommute among themselves only in the physical Hilbert space. We also discussrelations among degenerate physical states, degenerate vacua, and the existenceof multicomponent Schrodinger wavefunctions.
