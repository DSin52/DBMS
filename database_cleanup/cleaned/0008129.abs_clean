The problem of a regular matter source for the Kerr spinning particle isdiscussed. A class of minimal deformations of the Kerr-Newman solution isconsidered obeying the conditions of regularity and smoothness for the metricand its matter source.It is shown that for charged source corresponding matter forms a rotatingbag-like core having (A)dS interior and smooth domain wall boundary. Similarly,the requirement of regularity of the Kerr-Newman electromagnetic field leads tosuperconducting properties of the core.We further consider the U(I) x U'(I) field model (which was used by Witten todescribe cosmic superconducting strings), and we show that it can be adaptedfor description of superconducting bags having a long range externalelectromagnetic field and another gauge field confined inside the bag.Supersymmetric version of the Witten field model given by Morris is analyzed,and corresponding BPS domain wall solution interpolating between the outer andinternal supersymmetric vacua is considered. The charged bag bounded by thisBPS domain wall represents an `ultra-extreme' state with a total mass which islower than BPS bound of the wall. It is also shown that supergravity suggeststhe AdS vacuum state inside the bag.Peculiarities of this model for the rotating bag-like source of theKerr-Newman geometry are discussed.
