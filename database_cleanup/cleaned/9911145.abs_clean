Coimbra, 10.-15. Sept. 1999The vortex picture of confinement is studied. The deconfinement phasetransition is explained as a transition from a phase in which vorticespercolate to a phase of small vortices. Lattice results are presented insupport of this scenario. Furthermore the topological properties of magneticmonopoles and center vortices arising, respectively, in Abelian and centergauges are studied in continuum Yang-Mills-theory. For this purpose thecontinuum analog of the maximum center gauge is constructed.
