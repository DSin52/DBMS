Title: Mathematical aspects of chiral gauge theories on the lattice

Authors: Herbert Neuberger (Rutgers)

Comments: 10 pages, latex, uses ip.sty

For two decades it was believed that chiral symmetries cannot be realized inlattice field theory but this has changed now. Highlights of these newdevelopments will be presented with emphasis on the mathematical structure ofthe so called ``overlap''.
