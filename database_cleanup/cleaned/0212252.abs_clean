We construct several classes of exact supersymmetric supergravity solutionsdescribing D4 branes polarized into NS5 branes and F-strings polarized into D2branes. These setups belong to the same universality class as the perturbativesolutions used by Polchinski and Strassler to describe the string dual of N=1*theories. The D4-NS5 setup can be interpreted as a string dual to a confining4+1 dimensional theory with 8 supercharges, whose properties we discuss. ByT-duality, our solutions give Type IIB supersymmetric backgrounds withpolarized branes.
