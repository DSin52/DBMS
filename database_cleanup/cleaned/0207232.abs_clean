Starting from N=1 scalar supermultiplets in 2+1 dimensions, we buildexplicitly the composite superpartners which define a N=2 superalgebra inducedby the initial N=1 supersymmetry. The occurrence of this extension is linked tothe topologically conserved current out of which the composite superpartnersare constructed.
