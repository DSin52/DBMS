We consider superconformal field theories in three and six dimensions witheight supercharges which can be realized on the world-volume of M-theory branessitting at orbifold singularities. We find that they should admit a N=4 and N=2supergravity dual in AdS_4 and AdS_7, respectively. We discuss thecharacteristics of the corresponding gauged supergravities.
