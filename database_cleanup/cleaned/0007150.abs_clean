Workshop on Non Commutative Geometry and Superstring Theory, Rabat 16-17 June2000, to appear in the proceedingsTheorySupersymmetry and super-Lie algebras have been consistently generalizedpreviously. The so-called fractional supersymmetry and $F-$Lie algebras couldbe constructed starting from any representation $\D$ of any Lie algebra $g$.This involves taking the $F^{\mathrm th}$ root of $\D$ in some sense. We show,after having constructed differential realization(s) of any Lie algebra, howfractional supersymmetry can be explicitly realized in terms of appropriatehomogeneous monomials.
