Title: Light cone formalism in AdS spacetime

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX, Talk given at XIV International Workshop on High

Energy Physics and Quantum Field Theory QFTHEP'99, Moscow, Russia, 27 May - 2June, 1999Light cone form of field dynamics in anti-de Sitter spacetime is described.We also present light cone reformulation of the boundary conformal field theoryrepresentations. AdS/CFT correspondence between the bulk fields and theboundary operators is discussed.
