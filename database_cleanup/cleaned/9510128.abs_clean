We consider the perturbation of tachyon about the extremal ground state of atwo-dimensional (2D) electrically charged black hole. It is found that thepresenting potential to on-coming tachyonic wave takes a double-humped barrierwell. This allows an exponentially growing mode with respect to time. Thisextremal ground state is classically unstable. We conclude that the 2D extremalelectrically charged black hole cannot be a candidate for the stable endpointof the Hawking evaporation.
