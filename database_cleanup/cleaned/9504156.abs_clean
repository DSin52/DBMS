We consider a new action of a two-dimensional field theory interacting withgravitational field. The action is interpreted as the area of a surfaceimbedded into four-dimensional Mincowski target space. In addition toreparametrization invariance the new action has one extra infinite-dimensionallocal symmetry with a clear geometrical meaning. The special gauge choice,which includes the gauge condition of tracelessness of the energy-momentumtensor, leads to an effective free scalar field theory. The problem ofanomalies in quantum theory and possible connection with matrix quantummechanics are also discussed.
