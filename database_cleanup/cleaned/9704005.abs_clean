We show that the D-brane configurations for the five and four-dimensionalblack holes give the geometry of two and three-dimensional ones as well. Theemergence of these lower dimensional black holes from the D-braneconfigurations for those of higher dimensions comes from the choice of theintegration constant of harmonic functions, which decides the asymptoticbehavior of the metric and other fields. We show that they are equivalent,which are connected by U-dual transformations. This means that stringy blackholes in various dimensions are effectively in the same universality class andmany properties of black holes in the same class can be infered from the studyof those of the three-dimensional black holes.
