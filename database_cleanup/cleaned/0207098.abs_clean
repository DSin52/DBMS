The loop variable approach is a proposal for a gauge invariant generalizationof the sigma-model renormalization group method of obtaining equations ofmotion in string theory. The basic guiding principle is space-time gaugeinvariance rather than world-sheet properties. In essence it is a version ofWilson's exact renormalization group equation for the world sheet theory. Itinvolves all the massive modes and is defined with a finite world-sheet cutoff,which allows one to go off the mass-shell. On shell the tree amplitudes ofstring theory are reproduced. The equations are gauge invariant off shell also.This article is a self-contained discussion of the loop variable approach aswell as its connection with the renormalization group.
