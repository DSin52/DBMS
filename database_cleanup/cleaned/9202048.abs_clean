Title: Bloch Electron in a Magnetic Field

ModelsAuthors: Alexander Moroz

Comments: 12 pages

A connection of a variety of tight-binding models of noninteracting electronson a rectangular lattice in a magnetic field with theta functions isestablished. A new spectrum generating symmetry is discovered which essentialyreduces the problem of diagonalization of these models. Provided that one knowsone eigenvector at one point in the parameter space of the corresponding Harperequation one knows an eigenfunction of the corresponding model in the wholerange of momentum singlet out by the Landau gauge.
