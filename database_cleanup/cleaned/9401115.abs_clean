A nonlocal and nonlinear theory of hadrons, equivalent to the color singletsector two dimensional QCD, is constructed. The phase space space of thistheory is an infinite dimensional Grassmannian. The baryon number of QCDcorresponds to a topological invariant (`virtual rank') of the Grassmannian. Itis shown that the hadron theory has topological solitons corresponding to thebaryons of QCD. ${1\over N_c}$ plays the role of $\hbar$ in this theory; $N_c$must be an integer for topological reasons. We also describe the quantizationof a toy model with a finite dimensional Grassmannian as the phase space. In anappendix, we show that the usual Hartree--Fock theory of atomic and condensedmatter physics has a natural formulation in terms of infinite dimensionalGrassmannians.
