As a test of the conjectured QCD/supergravity duality, we consider mass gapsin the supergravity construction of QCD_2. We find a mass gap in the dual fieldtheory both when using non-rotating and rotating black D2-branes as backgroundsin the supergravity construction of QCD_2. So, since pure QCD_2 does not have amass gap, the dual field theory of the supergravity construction of QCD_2cannot be pure QCD_2. Considering the mass scales in the dual field theory ofthe supergravity construction of QCD_2, we find that this is explainable bothin the case of the non-rotating background and of the rotating background. Inparticular, the mass gap in the case of the rotating background can beexplained using results of the large angular momentum limit of euclideanrotating branes, obtained recently by Cvetic and Gubser. We furthermore remarkon the possible implications for the mass gaps in the supergravityconstructions of QCD_3 and QCD_4.
