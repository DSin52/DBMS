The horizon area and curvature of three-charge BPS black strings are studiedin the D-brane ensemble for the stationary black string. The chargedistributions along the string are used to translate the classical expressionsfor the horizon area and curvature of BPS black strings with waves intooperators on the D-brane Hilbert space. Despite the fact that any `wavy' blackstring has smaller horizon area and divergent curvature, the typical values ofthe horizon area and effects of the horizon curvature in the D-brane ensembledeviate negligibly from those of the original stationary black string in thelimit of large integer charges. Whether this holds in general will depend oncertain properties of the quantum bound states.
