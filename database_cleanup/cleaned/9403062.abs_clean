The one-loop effective potential in $2D$ dilaton gravity in conformal gaugeon the topologically non-trivial plane $\reals \times S^1$ and on thehyperbolic plane $H^2/\Gamma$ is calculated. For arbitrary choice of the treescalar potential it is shown, that the one-loop effective potential explicitlydepends on the reference metric (through the dependence on the radius of thetorus or the radius of $H^2/\Gamma$). This phenomenon is absent only for somespecial choice of the tree scalar potential corresponding to the Liouvillepotential and leading to one-loop ultraviolet finite theory. The effectiveequations are discussed and some interpretation of the reference metricdependence of the effective potential is made.
