Title: Conjectured Enumeration of irreducible Multiple Zeta Values, from Knots

and Feynman DiagramsComments: 11 pages, LaTeX

Multiple zeta values (MZVs) are under intense investigation in three arenasKreimer's proposal that field theory assigns MZVs to positive knots, viaFeynman diagrams whose momentum flow is encoded by link diagrams. Twoenumeration of positive knots, and enumeration of irreducible MZVs. Both wererecently tackled by Broadhurst and Kreimer (BK). Here we report large-scaleanalytical and numerical computations that test, with considerable severity,the BK conjecture that the number, $D_{n,k}$, of irreducible MZVs of weight $n$and depth $k$, is generated by $\prod_{n\ge3}\prod_{k\ge1}(1-x^n y^k)^{D_{n,k}}=1-\frac{x^3y}{1-x^2}+\frac{x^{12}y^2(1-y^2)}{(1-x^4)(1-x^6)}$, whichis here shown to be consistent with all shuffle identities for thecorresponding iterated integrals, up to weights $n=44, 37, 42, 27$, atdepths $k=2, 3, 4, 5$, respectively, entailing computation at thepetashuffle level. We recount the field-theoretic discoveries of MZVs, incounterterms, and of Euler sums, from more general Feynman diagrams, that ledto this success.
