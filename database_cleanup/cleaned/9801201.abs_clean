The superspace geometry of Chern-Simons forms is shown to be closely relatedto that of the 3-form multiplet. This observation allows to simplifyconsiderably the geometric structure of supersymmetric Chern-Simons forms andtheir coupling to linear multiplets. The analysis is carried through in U_K(1)superspace, relevant at the same time for supergravity-matter couplings and forchirally extended supergravity.
