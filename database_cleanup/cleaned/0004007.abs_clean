de Moriond session on QCD And High Energy Hadronic Interactions, Les Arcs1800, France, Mar 18-25The axial-gauge boson propagator contains 1/(n.k)^p-type singularities. Thesesingularities have generally been treated by inventing prescriptions for them.We propose an alternative procedere for treating these singularities in thepath-integral formalism using the known way of treating the 1/k^{2n}-typesingularities in Lorentz-type gauges. For this purpose we use a finitefield-dependent BRS transformation that inerpolates between the Lorentz andaxial-type gauges. We arrive at the \epsilon-dependent tree propagator inaxial-type gauges.
