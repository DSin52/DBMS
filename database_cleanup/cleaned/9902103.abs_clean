pages (LaTeX2e)The method of flow equations is applied to QED on the light front. Requiringthat the particle number conserving terms in the Hamiltonian are considered tobe diagonal and the other terms off-diagonal an effective Hamiltonian isobtained which reduces the positronium problem to a two-particle problem, sincethe particle number violating contributions are eliminated.Using an effective electron-positron Hamiltonian, obtained in the secondorder in coupling, we analyze the positronium bound state problem analyticallyand numerically. The results obtained for Bohr spectrum and hyperfine splittingcoincide to a high accuracy with experimental values. The rotationalinvariance, that is not manifest symmetry on the light-front, is recovered forpositronium mass spectrum.Except for the longitudinal infrared divergences, that are special for thelight-front gauge calculations, no infrared divergences appear. The ultravioletrenormalization in the second order in coupling constant is performedsimultaneously. To preserve boost invariance we take into account the diagramsarising from the normal ordering of instantaneous interactions. Using flowequations and coupling coherence we obtain the counterterms for electron andphoton masses, which are free from longitudinal infrared divergences.
