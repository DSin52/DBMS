We consider Type IIB Neveu-Schwarz five-branes transverse to C^2/Z_norbifolds and conjecture that string theory on the near horizon geometry isdual to the decoupled theory on the branes. We analyze the conformal fieldtheory describing the near horizon region and the world volume non-criticalstring theory. The modular invariance consistency condition of string theory isexactly reproduced as the gauge anomaly cancellation condition in the littlestring theories. We comment on aspects of the holographic nature of thisduality.
