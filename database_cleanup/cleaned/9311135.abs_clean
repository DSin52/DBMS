Title: Generalized quantization scheme for central extensions of Lie algebras

We present the method for finding of the nonlinear Poisson-Lie groupsstructures on the vector spaces and for their quantization. For arbitrarycentral extension of Lie algebra explicit formulas of quantization areproposed.
