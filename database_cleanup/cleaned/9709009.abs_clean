We investigate the geometric interpretation of the Standard Model based onnoncommutative geometry. Neglecting the $S_0$-reality symmetry one mayintroduce leptoquarks into the model. We give a detailed discussion of theconsequences (both for the Connes-Lott and the spectral action) and compare theresults with physical bounds. Our result is that in either case one contradictsthe experimental results.
