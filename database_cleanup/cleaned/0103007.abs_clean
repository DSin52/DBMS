Title: Conformal Boundary Conditions and what they teach us

Authors: V.B. Petkova and J.-B. Zuber

Comments: Expanded version of lectures given at the Summer School and

Conference Nonperturbative Quantum Field Theoretic Methods and theirApplications, August 2000, Budapest, Hungary. 35 pagesThe question of boundary conditions in conformal field theories is discussed,in the light of recent progress. Two kinds of boundary conditions are examined,along open boundaries of the system, or along closed curves or ``seams''.Solving consistency conditions known as Cardy equation is shown to amount tothe algebraic problem of finding integer valued representations of (one or twocopies of) the fusion algebra. Graphs encode these boundary conditions in anatural way, but are also relevant in several aspects of physics ``in thebulk''. Quantum algebras attached to these graphs contain information onstructure constants of the operator algebra, on the Boltzmann weights of thecorresponding integrable lattice models etc. Thus the study of boundaryconditions in Conformal Field Theory offers a new perspective on several oldphysical problems and offers an explicit realisation of recent mathematicalconcepts.
