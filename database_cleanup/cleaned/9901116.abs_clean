The covariant operator quantization of the ordinary free spinning BDH stringmodified by adding the supersymmetric Liouville sector is analysed in the eventarget space dimensions $d=2,4,6,8$. The spectrum generating algebra for thismodel is constructed and a general version of the no-ghost theorem is proven. Acounterpart of the GSO projection leads to a family of tachyon free unitaryfree string theories. One of these models is equivalent to the non-criticalRammond-Neveu-Schwarz spinning string truncated in the Neveu-Schwarz sector tothe tachyon free eigenspace of the fermion parity operator.
