Title: Large N gauge theories and AdS/CFT correspondence

Comments: 64 pages, Latex, Lectures given at the Spring Workshop on Superstring

and Related Matters, Trieste, Italy (March 1999)In the first part of these lectures we will review the main aspects of largeN QCD and the explicit results obtained from it. Then, after a review of theproperties of N=4 super Yang-Mills, type IIB string theory and of AdS space, webriefly discuss the Maldacena conjecture. Finally in the last part of theselectures we will discuss the finite temperature case and we show how "hadronic"quantities as the string tension, the mass gap and the topologicalsusceptibility can be computed in this approach.
