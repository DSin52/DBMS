Two point correlation functions of the off-critical primary fields \phi_{1,1+s} are considered in the perturbed minimal models M_{2, 2N+3} + \phi_{1,3}.They are given as infinite series of form factor contributions. The formfactors of \phi_{1, 1+s} are conjectured from the known results for those of\phi_{1,2} and \phi_{1,3}. The conjectured form factors are rewritten in theform which is convenient for summing up. The final expression of the two pointfunctions is written as a determinant of an integral operator.
