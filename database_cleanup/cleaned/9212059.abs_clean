We investigate the thermal equilibrium properties of kinks in a classical$\phi^4$ field theory in $1+1$ dimensions. The distribution function, kinkdensity, and correlation function are determined from large scale simulations.A dilute gas description of kinks is shown to be valid below a characteristictemperature. A double Gaussian approximation to evaluate the eigenvalues of thetransfer operator enables us to extend the theoretical analysis to highertemperatures where the dilute gas approximation fails. This approach accuratelypredicts the temperature at which the kink description breaks down.
