In the context of D-dimensional Euclidean gravity, we define the naturalgeneralisation to D-dimensions of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations, asduality conditions on the curvature 2-form of a Riemannian manifold.Solutions to these self-duality equations are provided by manifolds of SU(2),SU(3), G_2 and Spin(7) holonomy. The equations in eight dimensions are amaster set for those in lower dimensions. By considering gauge fieldspropagating on these self-dual manifolds and embedding the spin connection inthe gauge connection, solutions to the D-dimensional equations for self-dualYang-Mills fields are found. We show that the Yang-Mills action on suchmanifolds is topologically bounded from below, with the bound saturatedprecisely when the Yang-Mills field is self-dual. These results have a naturalinterpretation in supersymmetric string theory.
