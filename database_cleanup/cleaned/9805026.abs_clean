On the bundles of WZW chiral blocks over the moduli space of a puncturedrational curve we construct isomorphisms that implement the action of outerautomorphisms of the underlying affine Lie algebra. These bundle-isomorphismsrespect the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection and have finite order. When allprimary fields are fixed points, the isomorphisms are endomorphisms; in thiscase, the bundle of chiral blocks is typically a reducible vector bundle. Aconjecture for the trace of such endomorphisms is presented; the proposedrelation generalizes the Verlinde formula. Our results have applications toconformal field theories based on non-simply connected groups and to theclassification of boundary conditions in such theories.
