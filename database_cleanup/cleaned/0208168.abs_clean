Derrick's theorem on the nonexistence of stable time-independent scalar fieldconfigurations [G. H. Derrick, J. Math. Phys. 5, 1252 (1964)] is generalized tofinite systems of arbitrary dimension. It is shown that the "dilation" argumentunderlying the theorem hinges upon the fulfillment of specific Neumann boundaryconditions, providing thus new means of evading it without resorting totime-dependence or additional fields of higher spin. The theorem in itsoriginal form is only recovered when the boundary conditions are such that boththe gradient and potential energies vanish at the boundaries, in which case itestablishes the nonexistence of stable time-independent solutions in finitesystems of more than two spatial dimensions.
