Conformal isometry algebras of plane wave geometry are studied. Then, basedon the requirement of conformal invariance, a definition of masslessness isintroduced and gauge invariant equations of motion, subsidiary conditions, andcorresponding gauge transformations for all plane wave geometry massless spinfields are constructed. Light cone representation for elements of conformalalgebra acting as differential operators on wavefunctions of massless higherspin fields is also evaluated. Interrelation of plane wave geometry masslesshigher spin fields with ladder representation of $u(2,2)$ algebra isinvestigated.
