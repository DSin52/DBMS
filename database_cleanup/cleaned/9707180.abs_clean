As a quantitative test of this approach,we have performed extensive analytic and numerical calculations for2+1-dimensional pure gauge theory in the large $N$ limit. We study thestructure of coupling constant space for our effective potential by comparingwith results available from conventional Euclidean lattice Monte Carlosimulations of this system. In particular, we calculate and measure the scalingbehaviour of the entire low-lying glueball spectrum, glueball wavefunctions,string tension, asymptotic density of states, and deconfining temperature.
