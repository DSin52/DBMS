The kinematical part of general theory of deformational structures on smoothmanifolds is developed. We introduce general concept of d-objects deformation,then within the set of all such deformations we develop some special algebraand investigate group and homotopical properties of the set. In case of properdeformations some propositions, generalizing isometry theory on Riemannianmanifolds are formulated.
