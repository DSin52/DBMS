We explore the dynamic dS/CFT correspondence using the moving domainwall(brane) approach in the brane cosmology. The bulk spacetimes are given bythe Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black hole and the topological-de Sitter(TdS) solutions. We consider the embeddings of (Euclidean) moving domain wallsinto the (Euclidean) de Sitter spaces. The TdS solution is better to describethe static dS/CFT correspondence than the SdS black hole, while in the dynamicdS/CFT correspondence the SdS solution provides situation better than that ofthe TdS solution. However, we do not find a desirable cosmological scenariofrom the SdS black hole space.
