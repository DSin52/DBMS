When dealing with zeta-function regularized functional determinants of matrixvalued differential operators, an additional term, overlooked until now and dueto the multiplicative anomaly, may arise. The presence and physical relevanceof this term is discussed in the case of a charged bosonic field at finitecharge density and other possible applications are mentioned.
