Hyperinstantons, Black-Holes and p-Branesgiven at Santa Margerita Conference on Contrained Dynamics and QuantumGravity September 1995. In the replaced version misprints have been correctedand some sentences have been modifiedJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 57 (1997) 52-64

In this lecture I review recent results on the first order equationsdescribing BPS extremal states, in particular N=2 extremal black-holes. Therole of special geometry is emphasized also in the rigid theory and acomparison is drawn with the supersymmetric derivation of instantons andhyperinstantons in topological field theories. Work in progress on theapplication of solvable Lie algebras to the discussion of BPS states inmaximally extended supergravities is outlined.
