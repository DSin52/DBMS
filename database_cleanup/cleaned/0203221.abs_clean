We reexamine a scenario in which photons and gravitons arise as Goldstonebosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance. We studythe emergence of Lorentz invariant low energy physics in an effective fieldtheory framework, with non-Lorentz invariant effects arising from radiativecorrections and higher order interactions. Spontaneous breaking of the Lorentzgroup also leads to additional exotic but weakly coupled Goldstone bosons,whose dispersion relations we compute. The usual cosmological constant problemdevelop a potential, and the existence of a flat spacetime solution to thefield equations is guaranteed.
