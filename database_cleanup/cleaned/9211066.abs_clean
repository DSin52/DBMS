We propose that the correlation functions of the inhomogeneous eight vertexmodel in the anti-ferroelectric regime satisfy a system of difference equationswith respect to the spectral parameters. Solving the simplest differenceequation we obtain the expression for the spontaneous staggered polarizationconjectured by Baxter and Kelland. We discuss also a related construction ofvertex operators on the lattice.
