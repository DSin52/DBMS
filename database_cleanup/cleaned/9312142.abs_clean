The Laughlin function of quantum Hall effect is shown to satisfy Hirota'sbilinear difference equation with certain coefficients a little different fromthe KP hierarchy. Vertex operators which constitute blocks of solutionsgenerate a B\"acklund transformation. Besides the Laughlin function, theequation admits soliton solutions.
