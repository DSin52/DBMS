We study topological gauge theories with N=(2,0) supersymmetry based onstable bundles on general Kahler 3-folds. In order to have a theory that iswell defined and well behaved, we consider a model based on an extension ofthe usual holomorphic bundle by including a holomorphic 3-form. The correlationfunctions of the model describe complex 3-dimensional generalizations ofDonaldson-Witten type invariants. We show that the path integral can be writtenas a sum of contributions from stable bundles and a complex 3-dimensionalversion of Seiberg-Witten monopoles. We study certain deformations of thetheory, which allow us to consider the situation of reducible connections. Weshortly discuss situations of reduced holonomy. Afterdimensional reduction to aKahler 2-fold, the theory reduces to Vafa-Wittentheory. On a Calabi-Yau 3-fold,the supersymmetry is enhanced to N=(2,2). This model may be used to describeclassical limits of certain compactifications of(matrix) string theory.
