We consider perturbations of unitary minimal models by boundary fields.Initially we consider the models in the limit as c -> 1 and find that therelevant boundary fields all have simple interpretations in this limit. Thisinterpretation allows us to conjecture the IR limits of flows in the unitaryminimal models generated by the fields \phi_{rr} of `low' weight. We check thisconjecture using the truncated conformal space approach. In the process we findevidence for a new series of integrable boundary flows.
