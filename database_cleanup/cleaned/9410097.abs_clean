It is well known that the centerless W_{1+\infty} algebra provides ahamiltonian structure for the KP hierarchy. In this letter we address thequestion whether the centerful version plays a similar r\^ole in any relatedintegrable system. We find that, surprisingly enough, the centrally extendedW_{1+\infty} algebra yields yet another Poisson structure for the same standardKP hierarchy. This is proven by explicit construction of the infinitely manynew hamiltonians in closed form.
