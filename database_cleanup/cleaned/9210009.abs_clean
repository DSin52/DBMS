The quantum affine $\CU_q (\hat{sl(2)}) $ symmetry is studied when $q^2$ isan even root of unity. The structure of this algebra allows a naturalgeneralization of N=2 supersymmetry algebra. In particular it is found that themomentum operators $P ,\bar{P}$, and thus the Hamiltonian, can be written asgeneralized multi-commutators, and can be viewed as new central elements of thealgebra $\CU_q (\hat{sl(2)})$. We show that massive particles in (deformationsof) integer spin representions of $sl(2)$ are not allowed in such theories.Generalizations of Witten's index and Bogomolnyi bounds are presented and apreliminary attempt in constructing manifestly $\CU_q (\hat{sl(2)})$ invariantactions as generalized supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg theories is made.
