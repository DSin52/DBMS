We study the effect of the solitonic degree of freedom in string cosmologyfollowing the line of Rama. The gas of solitonic p-brane is treated as aperfect fluid in a Brans-Dicke type theory.In this paper, we find analytic solutions for a few solvable cases of equationof states with general Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$ and study the cosmologyof the solutions. In some cases the solutions are free from initialsingularity.
