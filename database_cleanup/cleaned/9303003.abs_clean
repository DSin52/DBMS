Title: Consistency and Phenomenology of Four-Dimensional Strings

Authors: Dieter Luest

Comments: 13 pages, CERN-TH.6819/93

requirements on four dimensional string models, namely the cancellation oftarget space duality anomalies. The analysis is explicitly performed for(hypothetical) orbifold models assuming the massless spectrum of thesupersymmetric standard model. In addition, some phenomenological properties offour-dimensional strings, like the unification of the standard model gaugecoupling constants and soft supersymmetry breaking parameters, areinvestigated.
