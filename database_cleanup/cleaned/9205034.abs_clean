The three-point functions for minimal models coupled to gravity are derivedin the operator approach to Liouville theory which is based on its $U_q(sl(2))$quantum group structure. The result is shown to agree with matrix-modelcalculations on the sphere. The precise definition of the correspondingcosmological constant is given in the operator solution of the quantumLiouville theory. It is shown that the symmetry between quantum-group spins $J$and $-J-1$ previously put forward by the author is the explanation of thecontinuation in the number of screening operators discovered by Goulian and Li.Contrary to the previous discussions of this problem, the present approachclearly separates the emission operators for each leg. This clarifies thestructure of the dressing by gravity. It is shown, in particular that the endpoints are not treated on the same footing as the mid point. Since the outcomeis completely symmetric this suggests the existence of a picture-changingmechanism in two dimensional gravity.
