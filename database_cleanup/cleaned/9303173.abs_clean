Title: The Zero Tension Limit of Strings and Superstrings

Authors: Ulf Lindstr\"{o}m

Comments: Invited lecture at the INFN ELOISATRON WORKSHOP "From Superstrings To

Supergravity", 7 pages Latex, University of Stockholm preprint USITP-93-3The string equivalent of a massless particle ($m=0$) is the tensionlessstring ($T=0$). The study of such strings is of interest when trying tounderstand the high energy limit of ordinary strings. I discuss the classical$T\to 0$ limit of the bosonic string, the spinning string and the superstring.A common feature is the appearence of a space-time (super-)conformal symmetryreplacing the world-sheet Weyl invariance. The question of whether thissymmetry may survive quantization is addressed. A lightcone analysis of thequantized bosonic tensionless string leads to severe constraints on thetheir topological properties only.
