the conference "Advanced Quantum Field Theory'' (in memory of ClaudeItzykson)We study the BPS states of non-critical strings which arise for zero sizeinstantons of exceptional groups. This is accomplished by using F-theory andM-theory duals and by employing mirror symmetry to compute the degeneracy ofmembranes wrapped around 2-cycles of the Calabi-Yau threefold. We find evidencefor a number of novel physical phenomena, including having infinitely manylight states with the first lightest state including a nearly masslessgravitino.
