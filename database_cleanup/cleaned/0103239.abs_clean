We propose a cosmological scenario in which the hot big bang universe isproduced by the collision of a brane in the bulk space with a bounding orbifoldplane, beginning from an otherwise cold, vacuous, static universe. The modeladdresses the cosmological horizon, flatness and monopole problems andgenerates a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of density perturbations withoutinvoking superluminal expansion (inflation). The scenario relies, instead, onphysical phenomena that arise naturally in theories based on extra dimensionsand branes. As an example, we present our scenario predominantly within thecontext of heterotic M-theory. A prediction that distinguishes this scenariofrom standard inflationary cosmology is a strongly blue gravitational wavespectrum, which has consequences for microwave background polarizationexperiments and gravitational wave detectors.
