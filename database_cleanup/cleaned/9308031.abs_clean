There is a general mechanism by which certain matter fields coupled togravity can generate a nontrivial effective potential for the conformal factorof the metric. It is based on a nonstandard regularization method, with thecutoff being defined independently of the conformal factor. This mechanismproduces a coupling of the matter fields to a dilaton, and a complicatedinteraction between matter, dilaton and metric. When it is applied to thestandard model, it gives an effective potential which can be used to predictthe top and Higgs masses. If the purely gravitational contribution to thepotential is added, the mass of the dilaton is of the order of Planck's massand the large hierarchy between the Planck and Fermi scales appears to be dueto the smallness of the Higgs-dilaton coupling.
