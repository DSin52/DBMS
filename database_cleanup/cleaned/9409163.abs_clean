The deformed algebra $\cal{A(R)}$, depending upon a Yang-Baxter R- matrix, isconsidered. The conditions under which the algebra is associative are discussedfor a general number of oscillators. Four types of solutions satisfying theseconditions are constructed and two of them can be represented by generalizedJordan-Wigner transformations.Our analysis is in some sense an extension of theboson realization of fermions from single-mode to multimode oscillators.
