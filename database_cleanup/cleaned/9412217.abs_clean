The lagrangian of the N=1, D=10 dual supergravity interacting with theYang-Mills matter multiplet is constructed starting immediately from theequations of motion obtained from the Bianchi Identities in the superspaceapproach. The difference is established in comparison with the Gates-Nishinolagrangian at the fourth order level in fermionic fields.
