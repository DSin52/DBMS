In the framework of nonassociative geometry (hep-th/0003238) a unifieddescription of continuum and discrete spacetime is proposed. In our approach atthe Planck scales the spacetime is described as a so-called "diodular discretestructure" which at large spacetime scales `looks like' a differentiablemanifold. After a brief review of foundations of nonassociative geometry,wediscuss the nonassociative smooth and discrete de Sitter spacetimes.
