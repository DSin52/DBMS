A class of generalized Taub-NUT gravitational instantons is reported in fivegeodesic dynamics of a spinless particle of unit mass on these staticgravitational instantons is studied. This is accomplished by finding ageneralized Runge-Lenz vector. Unlike the Kepler problem, or, the dynamics of aspinless particle on the familiar Taub-NUT gravitational instantons, the orbitsare not conic sections.
