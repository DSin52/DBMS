Title: Finite-temperature properties of the supersymmetric generalization of 3D

compact QEDComments: 8 pages, LaTeX2e, no figures

The finite-temperature properties of supersymmetric version of (2+1)D compactQED are explored. Integration over the dual photino yields an action of thedual photon in the form of a certain series. Only the first term of this seriesis of the potential form, while all the others are some unimportant correctionsto the kinetic term. Disregarding these, we arrive at the action where besidesthe purely bosonic sector with monopoles of charge 2, monopoles of charge 1 and3 are also present yielding certain corrections to the Debye mass of the dualphoton. The finite-temperature analysis of this action is performed, and the RGtrajectories of all the fugacities are found in the vicinity of theBerezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical point. It is found that in thiscritical region, the fugacities of monopoles of charge n=1,2,3 are scaled asthe correlation radius to the power $-2n^2$.
