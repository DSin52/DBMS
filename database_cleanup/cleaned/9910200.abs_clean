We give a very simple proof that the renormalization of the Chern-Simonscoupling in the Wilsonian effective action is exhausted at one-loop. Our proofcan apply to arbitrary 2+1-dimensional abelian as well as nonabelian gaugetheories without a bare Chern-Simons coupling, including any non-renormalizableinteractions and non-minimal couplings. Our proof reveals that small (but notlarge) gauge invariance is enough to ensure the absence of higher ordercorrections.
