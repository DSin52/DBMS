We discuss a canonical formalism method for constructing actions describingpropagation of W-strings on curved backgrounds. The method is based on theconstruction of a representation of the W-algebra in terms of currents madefrom the string coordinates and the canonically conjugate momenta. We constructsuch a representation for a W_3-string propagating in the background metricwith one flat direction by using a simple ansatz for the W-generators whereeach generator is a polynomial of the canonical currents and the veilbeins. Inthe case of a general background we show that the simple polynomial ansatzfails, and terms containing the veilbein derivatives must be added.
