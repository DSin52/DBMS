We study the spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking in a field theoreticalmodel in (2+1)-dimension, inspired by string theory. This model is a gaugetheory of an anti-symmetric tensor field and a vector field (photon). TheNambu-Goldstone (NG) boson for the spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking isidentified with the unphysical massless photon in the covariant quantization.We also discuss an analogue of the equivalence theorem between the amplitudesfor emission or absorption of the physical massive anti-symmetric tensor fieldand those of the unphysical massless photon. The low-energy effective action ofthe NG-boson is also discussed.
