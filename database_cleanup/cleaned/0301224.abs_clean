We take as starting point the planar model arising from the dimensionalreduction of the Maxwell Electrodynamics with the (Lorentz-violating)Carroll-Field-Jackiw term. We then write and study the extended Maxwellequations and the corresponding wave equations for the potentials. The solutionto these equations show some interesting deviations from the usual MCSElectrodynamics, with background-dependent correction terms. In the case of atime-like background, the correction terms dominate over the MCS sector in theregion far from the origin, and establish the behaviour of a masslessElectrodynamics (in the electric sector). In the space-like case, the solutionsindicate the clear manifestation of spatial anisotropy, which is consistentwith the existence of a privileged direction is space.
