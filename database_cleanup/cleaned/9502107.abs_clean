Witten has argued that in $2+1$ dimensions local supersymmetry can ensure thevanishing of the cosmological constant without requiring the equality of boseand fermi masses. We find that this mechanism is implemented in a novel fashionin the (2+1)-dimensional supersymmetric abelian Higgs model coupled tosupergravity. The vortex solitons are annihilated by half of the supersymmetrytransformations. The covariantly constant spinors required to define thesesupersymmetries exist by virtue of a surprising cancellation between theAharonov-Bohm phase and the phase associated with the holonomy of the spinconnection. However the other half of the supersymmetry transformations, whoseactions ordinarily generate the soliton supermultiplet, are not well-definedand bose-fermi degeneracy is consequently absent in the soliton spectrum.
