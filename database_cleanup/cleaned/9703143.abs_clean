We discuss the application of T-duality to massive supersymmetric sigmamodels. In particular (1,1) supersymmetric models with off-shell centralcharges reveal an interesting structure. The T-duality transformations of theBPS states of these theories are also discussed and an explicit example ofQ-kinks is given.
