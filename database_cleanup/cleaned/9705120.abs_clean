We compute long-distance interaction potentials between certain 1/2 and 1/4supersymmetric D-brane configurations of type IIB theory, demonstratingdetailed agreement between classical supergravity and one-loop instanton matrixmodel results. This confirms the interpretation of D-branes as described byclassical matrix model backgrounds as being `populated' by large number ofD-instantons, i.e. as corresponding to non-marginal bound states of branes oflower dimensions. In the process, we establish precise relation between matrixmodel expressions and non-abelian F^4 terms in the super Yang-Mills effectiveaction.
