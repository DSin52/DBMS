Affine transformations (dilatations and translations) are used to define adeformation of one-dimensional $N=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics.Resulting physical systems do not have conserved charges and degeneracies inthe spectra. Instead, superpartner Hamiltonians are $q$-isospectral, i.e. thespectrum of one can be obtained from another (with possible exception of thelowest level) by $q^2$-factor scaling. This construction allows easily torederive a special self-similar potential found by Shabat and to show that forthe latter a $q$-deformed harmonic oscillator algebra of Biedenharn andMacfarlane serves as the spectrum generating algebra. A general class ofpotentials related to the quantum conformal algebra $su_q(1,1)$ is described.Further possibilities for $q$-deformation of known solvable potentials areoutlined.Talk presented at the workshop on Harmonic Oscillators, College Park, 25-28March 1992.
