In this paper we consider brane solutions of the form $G/H$ in M(atrix)theory, showing the emergence of world volume coordinates for the cases where$G=SU(N)$. We examine a particular solution with a world volume geometry of theform ${\bf CP}^2 \times S^1$ in some detail and show how a smooth manifoldstructure emerges in the large $N$ limit. In this limit the solution becomesstatic; it is not supersymmetric but is part of a supersymmetric set ofconfigurations. Supersymmetry in small locally flat regions can be obtained,but this is not globally defined. A general group theoretic analysis of thepreviously known spherical membrane solutions is also given.
