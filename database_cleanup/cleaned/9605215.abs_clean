Using instanton calculus we check, in the weak coupling region, thenonperturbative relation $$ <\Tr\phi^2>=i\pi\left(\cf-{a\over 2}{\partial\cf\over\partial a}\right)$$ obtained for a N=2 globallysupersymmetric gauge theory. Our computations are performed for instantons ofwinding number k, up to k=2 and turn out to agree with previous nonperturbativeresults.
