A class of background independent membrane field theories are studied, andseveral properties are discovered which suggest that they may play a role in abackground independent form of M theory. The bulk kinematics of these theoriesare described in terms of the conformal blocks of an algebra G on all oriented,finite genus, two-surfaces. The bulk dynamics is described in terms of causalhistories in which time evolution is specified by giving amplitudes to certainlocal changes of the states. Holographic observables are defined which live infinite dimensional states spaces associated with boundaries in spacetime. Weshow here that the natural observables in these boundary state spaces are, whenG is chosen to be Spin(D) or a supersymmetric extension of it, generalizationsof matrix model coordinates in D dimensions. In certain cases the bulk dynamicscan be chosen so the matrix model dynamics is recoverd for the boundaryobservables. The bosonic and supersymmetric cases in D=3 and D=9 are studied,and it is shown that the latter is, in a certain limit, related to the matrixmodel formulation of M theory. This correspondence gives rise to a conjectureconcerning a background independent form of M theory in terms of whichexcitations of the background independent membrane field theory that correspondto strings and D0 branes are identified.
