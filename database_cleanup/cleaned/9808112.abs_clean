We construct a class of representations of the Heisenberg algebra in terms ofthe complex shift operators subject to the proper continuous limit imposed bythe correspondence principle. We find a suitable Hilbert space formulation ofshifts. The representations involving imaginary shifts are free of spectrumdoubling. We determine the corresponding coordinate and momentum operatorssatisfying the canonical commutation relations. The eigenvalues of thecoordinate operator are in both cases discrete.
