We analyze the statistical mechanics of a gas of neutral and charged blackholes. The microcanonical ensemble is the only possible approach to thissystem, and the equilibrium configuration is the one for which most of theenergy is carried by a single black hole. Schwarzschild black holes are foundto obey the statistical bootstrap condition. In all cases, the microcanonicaltemperature is identical to the Hawking temperature of the most massive blackhole in the gas. U(1) charges in general break the bootstrap property. Theproblems of black hole decay and of quantum coherence are also addressed.
