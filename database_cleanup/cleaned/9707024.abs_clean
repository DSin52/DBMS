The propagator of the spinless Aharonov-Bohm-Coulomb system is derived byfollowing the Duru-Kleinert method. We use this propagator to explore thespin-1/2 Aharonov-Bohm-Coulomb system which contains a point interaction as aZeeman term. Incorporation of the self-adjoint extension method into theGreen's function formalism properly allows us to derive the finite propagatorof the spin-1/2 Aharonov-Bohm-Coulomb system. As a by-product, the relationbetween the self-adjoint extension parameter and the bare coupling constant isobtained. Bound-state energy spectra of both spinless and spin-1/2Aharonov-Bohm-Coulomb systems are examined.
