We calculate the canonical partition function $Z_N$ for a system of $N$ freeparticles obeying so-called `quon' statistics where $q$ is real and satisfies$|q|<1$ by using simple counting arguments. We observe that this system isafflicted by the Gibbs paradox and that $Z_N$ is independent of $q$. Wedemonstrate that such a system of particles obeys the ideal gas law and thatthe internal energy $U$ ( and hence the specific heat capacity $C_V$ ) isidentical to that of a system of $N$ free particles obeying Maxwell-Boltzmannstatistics.
