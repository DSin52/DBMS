The results of analysis of the one--loop spectrum of anomalous dimensions ofcomposite operators in the scalar $ \phi^{4} $ model are presented. We give therigorous constructive proof of the hypothesis on the hierarchical structure ofthe spectrum of anomalous dimensions -- the naive sum of any two anomalousdimensions generates a limit point in the spectrum. Arguments in favor of thenonperturbative character of this result and the possible ways of ageneralization to other field theories are briefly discussed.
