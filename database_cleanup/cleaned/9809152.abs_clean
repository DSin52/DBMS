We develop a constructive method to derive exactly solvable quantummechanical models of rational (Calogero) and trigonometric (Sutherland) type.triangular finite matrices. These eigenvectors are transcribed intoeigenfunctions of a selfadjoint Schr\"odinger operator. We prove thefeasibility of our method by constructing a new "$AG_3$ model" of trigonometrictype (the rational case was known before from Wolfes 1975). Applying a Coxetergroup analysis we prove its equivalence with the $B_3$ model. In order tobetter understand features of our construction we exhibit the $F_4$ rationalmodel with our method.
