We show that the Higgs branch of a four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, withgauge and matter content summarised by an E_8 quiver diagram, is identical tothe generalised Coulomb branch of a four-dimensional superconformal stronglycoupled gauge theory with E_8 global symmetry. This is the final step inshowing that there is a Higgs-Coulomb identity of this kind for each of thecases {0}, A_1, A_2, D_4, E_6, E_7 and E_8. This series of equivalencessuggests the existence of a mirror symmetry between the quiver theories and thestrongly coupled theories. We also discuss how to interpret the parameters ofthe quiver gauge theory in terms of the Hanany-Witten picture.
