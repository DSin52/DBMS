addedWe consider duality transformations in N=2 Yang--Mills theory coupled to N=2supergravity, in a manifestly symplectic and coordinate covariant setting. Wegive the essential of the geometrical framework which allows one to discussstringy classical and quantum monodromies, the form of the spectrum of BPSsaturated states and the Picard--Fuchs identities encoded in the specialgeometry of N=2 supergravity theories.
