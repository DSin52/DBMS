A BRST perturbative analysis of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in a class of maximalAbelian gauges is presented. We point out the existence of a new nonintegratedrenormalizable Ward identity which allows to control the dependence of thetheory from the diagonal ghosts. This identity, called the diagonal ghostequation, plays a crucial role for the stability of the model under radiativecorrections implying, in particular, the vanishing of the anomalous dimensionof the diagonal ghosts. Moreover, the Ward identity corresponding to theAbelian Cartan subgroup is easily derived from the diagonal ghost equation.Finally, a simple proof of the fact that the beta function of the gaugecoupling can be obtained from the vacuum polarization tensor with diagonalgauge fields as external legs is given. A possible mechanism for the decouplingof the diagonal ghosts at low energy is also suggested.
