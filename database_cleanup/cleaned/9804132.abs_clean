We present an analytical continuum calculation, starting from firstprinciples, of the vacuum wavefunction and string tension for pure Yang-Millstheories in $(2+1)$ dimensions, extending our previous analysis usinggauge-invariant matrix variables. The vacuum wavefunction is consistent withwhat is expected at both high and low momentum regimes. The value of the stringtension is in very good agreement with recent lattice Monte Carlo evaluations.
