Title: Quantization of the Superstring with Manifest U(5) Super-Poincare

InvarianceComments: Added two comments on relation to light-cone gauge

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B457 (1999) 94-100

The superstring is quantized in a manner which manifestly preserves a U(5)subgroup of the (Wick-rotated) ten-dimensional super-Poincar\'e invariance.This description of the superstring contains critical N=2 worldsheetsuperconformal invariance and is a natural covariantization of theU(4)-invariant light-cone Green-Schwarz description.
