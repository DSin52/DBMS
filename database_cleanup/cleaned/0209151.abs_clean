We examine two restructurings of the series relationship between the bare andrenormalized coupling constant in dimensional regularization. In one of theserestructurings, we are able to demonstrate via all-orders summation of leadingand successive epsilon = 0 (dimensionality = 4) poles that the bare couplingvanishes in the dimension-4 limit.
