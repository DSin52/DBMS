We develop the method of the hamiltonian reduction of affine Liesuperalgebras to obtain explicit and general expressions both for the classicaland the quantum extended superconformal algebras. By performing the gaugetransformation which connects the diagonal gauge with the Drinfeld-Sokolovgauge and considering the quantum corrections, we get generic expressions forthe classical and quantum free field realizations of the algebras.
