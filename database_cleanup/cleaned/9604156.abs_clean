We calculate the potential between two different stationary D-branes and thevelocity dependent potential between two different moving D-branes. We identifyconfigurations with some unbroken supersymmetry, using a zero force condition.The potentials are compared with an eleven dimensional calculation of thescattering of a zero black-brane from the $0,2,4$ and 6 black-brane of typeIIA supergravity. The agreement of these calculations provide further evidencefor the D-brane description of black-branes, and for the eleven dimensionalorigin of type IIA string theory.
