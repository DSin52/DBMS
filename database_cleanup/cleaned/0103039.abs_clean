We analyze zero energy solutions of the Dirac equation in the background of astring-like configuration in an extension of the standard model whichaccommodates the most general fermionic mass matrix for neutrinos. If eitherthe left- or the right-handed Majorana mass vanishes, neutrino and electronzero modes are found to exist. If the harmonic mean of the neutrino Majoranamasses is large compared to the Dirac mass, we can prove that normalizableneutrino zero modes cease to exist. This leads to an odd number of fermioniczero modes -- namely, only the electron zero mode -- which we argue impliesthat the bosonic background is in a topologically distinct sector from thevacuum. This is confirmed by noting that the bosonic sector of the modelinvolves the breaking of a global U(1) symmetry and hence possesses topologicalglobal U(1) strings.
