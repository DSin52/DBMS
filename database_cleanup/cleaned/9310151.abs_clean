Perturbative breaking of supersymmetry in four-dimensional string theoriespredict in general the existence of new large dimensions at the TeV scale. Suchdimensions can be consistent with perturbative unification up to the Planckscale in a class of string models and open the exciting possibility of loweringa part of the massive string spectrum at energies accessible to futureaccelerators. The main signature is the production of Kaluza-Klein excitationswhich have a very particular structure, strongly correlated with thesupersymmetry breaking mechanism. We present a model independent analysis ofthe physics of these states in the context of orbifold compactifications of theheterotic superstring. In particular, we compute the limits on the size oflarge dimensions used to break supersymmetry.
