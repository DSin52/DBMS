Although the formulas of tachyon inflation correspond to those of theinflation driven by the ordinary scalar field, there is obvious differencebetween them, which can not be neglected. We calculate the scalar and tensorperturbation of the string theory inspired tachyon inflation, which has beenwidely studied recently. We also show, through the Hamilton-Jacobi approach,that the the rolling tachyon can essentially produce enough inflation. An exactsolution with the inverse squared potential of tachyon field has been proposedand its power spectra has been analyzed.
