We analyze terms subleading to Rutherford in the $S$-matrix between blackhole and probes of successively high energies. We show that by an appropriatechoice of the probe one can read off the quantum state of the black hole fromthe S-matrix, staying asymptotically far from the BH all the time. We interpretthe scattering experiment as scattering off classical stringy backgrounds whichexplicitly depend on the internal quantum numbers of the black hole.
