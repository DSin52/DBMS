We identify the lift to M theory of the four types of orientifold points, andshow that they involve a chiral fermion on an orbifold fixed circle. From thislift, we compute the number of normalizable ground states for the SO(N) and$Sp(N)$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics with sixteen supercharges. The resultsagree with known results obtained by the mass deformation method. The mass ofthe orientifold is identified with the Casimir energy.
