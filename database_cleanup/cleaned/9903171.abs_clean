The infinite dimensional generalization of the quantum mechanics of extendedobjects, namely, the quantum field theory of extended objects is presented. Theparadigm example studied in this paper is the Euclidean scalar field with a$\lambda (\phi^{6})/6!$ interaction in four spacetime dimensions. The theory isfound to be finite when the virtual particle intermediate states arecharacterized by fuzzy particles instead of ordinary pointlike particles.Causality, Lorentz invariance, and unitarity (verified up to fourth order inthe coupling constant) are preserved in the theory. In addition, theKallen-Lehmann spectral representation for the propagator is discussed.
