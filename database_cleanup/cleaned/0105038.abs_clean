We show that one can construct D-branes in parafermionic and WZW theories(and their orbifolds) which have very natural geometrical interpretations, andyet are not automatically included in the standard Cardy construction ofD-branes in rational conformal field theory. The relation between thesetheories and their T-dual description leads to an analogy between theseD-branes and the familiar A-branes and B-branes of N=2 theories.
