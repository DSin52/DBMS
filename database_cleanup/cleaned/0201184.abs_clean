Title: Deligne Cohomology for Orbifolds, discrete torsion and B-fields

Authors: Ernesto Lupercio and Bernardo Uribe

Comments: To be published in the Proceedings of the Summer School "Geometric

and Topological methods for Quantum Field Theory", Villa de Leyva, Colombia(2001)Topology; Algebraic Topology; Algebraic GeometryIn this paper we introduce the concept of Deligne cohomology of an orbifold.We prove that the third Deligne cohomology group of a smooth \'{e}tale groupoidclassify gerbes with connection over the groupoid. We argue that the $B$-fieldand the discrete torsion in type II superstring theories are special kinds ofgerbes with connection, and finally, for each one of them, using Delignecohomology we construct a flat line bundle over the inertia groupoid, namely aRuan inner local in the case of an orbifold.
