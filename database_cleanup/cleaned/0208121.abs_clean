We derive the complete five-gluon scattering amplitude at tree level, withinthe context of Open Superstring theory. We find the general expression in termsof kinematic factors, and also find its complete expansion up to ${\calO}({\alpha'}^3)$ terms. We use our scattering amplitude to test threenon-equivalent ${\cal O}({\alpha'}^3)$ effective lagrangians that have recentlybeen matter of some controversy.
