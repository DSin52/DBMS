If violation of Lorentz and CPT symmetry is introduced into the fermionsector of conventional quantum electrodynamics, then the Chern-Simons term isradiatively induced with finite nonzero coefficient, as well as the Maxwellterm is with logarithmically divergent one. The heat kernel expansion and theproper time methods are used to determine the effective action in the one-loopapproximation unambiguously.
