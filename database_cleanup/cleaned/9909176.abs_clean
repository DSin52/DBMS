In string theory, D-branes can be expressed as a configuration of infinitelymany lower dimensional D-branes. Using this relation, the worldvolume theory ofD-branes can be regarded as the worldvolume theory of the infinitely many lowerdimensional branes. In the description in terms of the lower dimensionalbranes, some of the worldvolume coordinates become noncommutative. Actuallythis noncommutative theory can be regarded as noncommutative Yang-Mills theory.Therefore the worldvolume theory of D-branes have two equivalent descriptions,namely the usual static gauge description using ordinary Yang-Mills theory andthe noncommutative description using noncommutative Yang-Mills theory. It willbe shown that these two descriptions correspond to two different ways of gaugefixing of the reparametrization invariance and its generalization. We will givean explicit relation between commutative gauge field and noncommutative gaugefield in semiclassical approximation, when the gauge group is U(1).
