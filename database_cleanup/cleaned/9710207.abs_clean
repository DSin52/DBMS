Multidimensional cosmological, static spherically symmetric and Euclideanconfigurations are described in a unified way for gravity interacting withseveral dilatonic fields and antisymmetric forms, associated with electric andmagnetic p-branes. Exact solutions are obtained when certain vectors, builtfrom the input parameters of the model, are either orthogonal in theminisuperspace, or form mutually orthogonal subsystems. Some properties ofblack-hole solutions are indicated, in particular, a no-hair-type theorem andrestrictions emerging in models with multiple times. From the non-existence ofLorentzian wormholes, a universal restriction is obtained, applicable toorthogonal or block-orthogonal subsystems of any p-brane systems. Euclideanwormhole solutions are found, their actions and radii are explicitlycalculated.
