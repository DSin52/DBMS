It is known that the one-loop effective action of ${QED}_2$ is a quadratic incontributions beyond second order vanish. For nonzero fermion mass it is shownthat this behavior persists for a general class of fields for at least onevalue of the fermion mass when the external field's flux $\Phi$ satisfies$0<|e\Phi|<2\pi$. For ${QED}_4$ with (anti-) self-dual fields the mass-shellrenormalized one-loop effective action vanishes for at least one value of thefermion mass provided a plausible zero-mass limit exists.
