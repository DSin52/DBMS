School on ``Advances in Quantum Field Theory, Statistical Mechanics andDynamical Systems'', Landau Network at Centro A. Volta, Villa Olmo, Como,Italy, September 7-20 1998, to appear in the proceedingsWe report on the computation of the one-instanton contribution to the16-point Green function of fermionic composite operators in N=4 Super YMtheory. The remarkable agreement, initially found in the case of an SU(2) gaugegroup, with the one D-instanton contribution to the corresponding type IIBsuperstring amplitude on $AdS_5\times S^5$ is reviewed here. The recentextension by other authors of this result to any SU(N) gauge group and tomulti-instantons in the large N limit is briefly discussed. We also argue thatfor the AdS/SCFT correspondence under consideration to work for any $N\geq 2$,at least for some protected interactions, string effects should require atruncation of the Kaluza--Klein spectrum for finite $S^5$ radius much in thesame way as worldsheet unitarity restricts the allowed isospins in SU(2) WZWmodels. Finally, we briefly comment on the logarithmic behavior of somefour-point Green functions of scalar composite operators.
