We study the spacetimes of the near-horizon regions in D3-brane, M2-brane andM5-brane configurations, in cases where there is a pp-wave propagating along adirection in the world-volume. While non-extremal configurations of this kindlocally have the same Carter-Novotny-Horsky-type metrics as those without thewave, taking the BPS limit results instead in Kaigorodov-type metrics, whichare homogeneous, but preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry, and have global andlocal structures that are quite different from the corresponding anti-de Sitterspacetimes associated with solutions where there is no pp-wave. We show thatthe momentum density of the system is non-vanishing and held fixed under thegravity decoupling limit. In view of the AdS/CFT correspondence, M-theory andtype IIB theory in the near-horizon region of these boosted BPS-configurationsspecifies the corresponding CFT on the boundary in an infinitely-boosted framewith constant momentum density. We model the microstates of such boostedconfigurations (which account for the microscopic counting of near-extremalblack holes in D=7, D=9 and D=6) by those of a boosted dilute massless gas in ad=4, d=3 and d=6 spacetime respectively. Thus we obtain a simple descriptionfor the entropy of 2-charge black holes in D=7,9 and 6 dimensions. The paperincludes constructions of generalisations of the Kaigorodov andCarter-Novotny-Horsky metrics in arbitrary spacetime dimensions, and aninvestigation of their properties.
