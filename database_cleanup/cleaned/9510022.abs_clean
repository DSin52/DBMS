We discuss non-perturbative aspects of string effective field theories withN=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions. By the use of a scalar potential, whichis on-shell invariant under the supersymmetric duality of the dilaton, we studygaugino condensation in (2,2) symmetric Z_{N} orbifold compactifications. Theduality under consideration relates a two-form antisymmetric tensor to apseudoscalar. We show, that our approach is independent of thesuperfield-representation of the dilaton and preserves the U(1)_{PQ}Peccei-Quinn symmetry exactly.
