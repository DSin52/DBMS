We extend equal rank embedding of reductive Lie algebras to that of basic Liesuperalgebras. The Kac character formulas for equal rank embedding are derivedin terms of subalgebras and Kostant's cubic Dirac operator for equal rankembedding of Lie superalgebras is constructed from both even and odd generatorsand their related structure constants.
