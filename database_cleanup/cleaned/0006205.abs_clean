Fermions on the lattice have bosonic excitations generated from theunderlying periodic background. These, the lattice bosons, arise near the emptyband or when the bands are nearly full. They do not depend on the nature of theinteractions and exist for any fermion-fermion coupling. We discuss theselattice boson solutions for the Dirac Hamiltonian.
