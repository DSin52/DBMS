The superstring in $D\!=\!3,4$ and 6 is invariant under an $N\!=\!D\!-\!2$superconformal algebra based on $\widehat{S^{D-3}}$. There is a directrelationship between this (world-sheet) symmetry and the super-Poincar\'e(target space) symmetry. We establish this relationship using the light-conegauge, show how the statement generalizes to $D\!=\!10$ and examine theproperties of the $N\!=\!8$ superconformal algebra and the possibleimplications of its existence.
