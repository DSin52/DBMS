We study dimensional reductions of noncommutative electrodynamics on flatspace which lead to gauge theories of gravitation. For a general class of suchreductions, we show that the noncommutative gauge fields naturally yield aWeitzenbock geometry on spacetime and that the induced diffeomorphism invariantfield theory can be made equivalent to a teleparallel formulation of gravitywhich macroscopically describes general relativity. The Planck length isdetermined in this setting by the Yang-Mills coupling constant and thenoncommutativity scale. The effective field theory can also containhigher-curvature and non-local terms which are characteristic of string theory.Some applications to D-brane dynamics and generalizations to include thecoupling of ordinary Yang-Mills theory to gravity are also described.
