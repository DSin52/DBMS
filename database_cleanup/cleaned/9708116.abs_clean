We interpret a class of 4k-dimensional instanton solutions found by Ward,Corrigan, Goddard and Kent as four-dimensional instantons at angles. Thesuperposition of each pair of four-dimensional instantons is associated withfour angles which depend on some of the ADHM parameters. All these solutionsare associated with the group $Sp(k)$ and are examples of Hermitian-Einsteinconnections on $\bE^{4k}$. We show that the eight-dimensional solutionspreserve 3/16 of the ten-dimensional N=1 supersymmetry. We argue that under thecorrespondence between the BPS states of Yang-Mills theory and those ofM-theory that arises in the context of Matrix models, the instantons at anglesconfiguration corresponds to the longitudinal intersecting 5-branes on a stringat angles configuration of M-theory.
