Title: Stochastic Quantization of Autonomous Phi**4

Authors: U. Ritschel

Comments: 8 pages Latex + corrected(!) Postscript file

The non-perturbative autonomous renormalization of the scalar $\Phi^4$-modelis applied in the framework of stochastic quantization. I show that thisrequires a selective, momentum-dependent renormalization of the Onsagercoefficient $\lambda$, a direct consequence of the characteristic wavefunctionrenormalization applied. As a result, I obtain a Langevin equation for therenormalized constant mode of the field, which is solved numerically. It isdemonstrated for temperature zero that, starting from specified initialconditions, the system relaxes to its equilibrium state, the symmetry-breakingvacuum of the ``static'' $\Phi^4$-theory.
