The minimal Standard Model exhibits a nontrivial chiral U(2) symmetry if thevev and the hypercharge splitting (Delta) of right-handed leptons (quarks) in afamily vanish and Q=T_0 + Y independently in each helicity sector. As ageneralization, we start with SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_{(B-L)} and introduceDelta as a continuous parameter which is a measure of explicit symmetrybreakdown. Values of Delta between zero and 1/2 take the neutral generator ofthe isospin-1/2 representation to the singlet representation, i.e. `deformes'the LR representation into the minimal Standard one. The correspondingclassical O(3)-breaking term is a magnetic field perpendicular to the x_3-axis.A simple mapping on the fundamental Drinfeld-Jimbo q-deformed SU(2)representation is given.
