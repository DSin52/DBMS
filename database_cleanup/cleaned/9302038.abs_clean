Postulate of SL(2,\Z) invariance of toroidally compactified heterotic stringtheory in four dimensions implies the existence of new string (dual string)states carrying both, electric and magnetic charges. In this paper we study theinteraction between these dual strings. In particular, we consider scatteringof two such strings in the limit where one string passes through the otherstring without touching it, and show that such a scattering leads to theexchange of a fixed amount of electric and magnetic charges between the twostrings.
