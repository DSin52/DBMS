Authors: Stephen C. Davis

Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure, to appear in the Proceedings of the XVIII IAP

Colloquium `On the nature of dark energy', Paris, 1-5 July 2002The effects of higher order gravity terms on a dilatonic brane world modelare discussed. For a single positive tension flat 3-brane, and one infiniteextra dimension, we present a particular class of solutions with finite4-dimensional Planck scale and no naked singularities. A `self-tuning'mechanism for relaxing the cosmological constant on the brane, without adrastic fine tuning of parameters, is discussed in this context.
