Closed bosonic string theory on toroidal orbifolds is studied in a Lagrangianpath integral formulation. It is shown that a level one twisted WZW actionwhose field value is restricted to Cartan subgroups of simply-laced Lie groupson a Riemann surface is a natural and nontrivial extension of a first quantizedaction of string theory on orbifolds with an antisymmetric background field.
