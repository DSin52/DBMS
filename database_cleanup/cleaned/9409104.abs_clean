The Wess-Zumino consistency condition for four-dimensional Einstein gravityis investigated in the space of local forms involving the fields, the ghosts,the antifields and their derivatives. Its general solution is constructed forall values of the form degree and of the ghost number. It is shown inparticular that the antifields (= sources for the BRST variations) can occuronly through cohomologically trivial terms.
