By representing the field content as well as the particle creation operatorsin terms of fermionic Fock operators, we compute the corresponding matrixelements of the Federbush model. Only when these matrix elements satisfy theform factor consistency equations involving anyonic factors of localcommutativity, the corresponding operators are local. We carry out theultraviolet limit, analyze the momentum space cluster properties anddemonstrate how the Federbush model can be obtained from the$SU(3)_3$-homogeneous sine-Gordon model. We propose a new Lagrangian which onone hand constitutes a generalization of the Federbush model in a Lie algebraicfashion and on the other a certain limit of the homogeneous sine-Gordon models.
