Title: On the Classicality of Broda's SU(2) Invariant of 4-manifolds

Comments: 4 pages (revised to state correctly Lemma 1--the correct lemma was

proved, and used throughout, but the original statement jumbled somephrases--and add an explanatory footnote on an abuse of language)Recent work of Roberts has shown that the first surgical 4-manifold invariantof Broda and (up to an unspecified normalization factor) the state-suminvariant arising from the TQFT of Crane-Yetter are equivalent to the signatureof the 4-manifold. Subsequently Broda defined another surgical invariant inwhich the 1- and 2-handles are treated differently. We use a refinement ofRoberts' techniques developped by the authors in hep-th/9309063 to show thatthe "improved" surgical invariant of Broda also depends only on the signatureand Euler character
