We show that the most general stationary electrically charged black-holesolutions of the heterotic string compactified on a (10-D)-torus (where D > 3)can be obtained by using the solution generating transformations of Sen actingon the Myers and Perry metric. The conserved charges labeling these black-holesolutions are the mass, the angular momentum in all allowed commuting planes,and 36-2D electric charges. General properties of these black-holes are alsostudied.
