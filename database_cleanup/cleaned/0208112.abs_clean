We show that in the absence of a Ramond-Ramond sector both the type IIA andtype IIB free string gases have a thermal instability due to low temperaturetachyon modes. The gas of free IIA strings undergoes a thermal dualitytransition into a gas of free IIB strings at the self-dual temperature T_C. Thefree heterotic string gas is a tachyon-free ensemble with gauge symmetrySO(16)xSO(16) in the presence of a timelike Wilson line background. It exhibitsa holographic duality relation undergoing a self-dual phase transition at T_Cwith positive free energy and positive specific heat. The ensemble isthermodynamically stable with no analog of the unphysical fixed point entropyand tachyonic modes of the pedagogically similar bosonic string gas. The type Iopen and closed string gas explicitly violates thermal duality. The oneloopfree energy vanishes identically as a consequence of tadpole cancellation. Weidentify the order parameter for the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition froma low temperature gas of short open strings to a high temperature long stringphase at or below T_C.
