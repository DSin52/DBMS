Title: String Vertices and Inner Derivations

Comments: 13 pages, phyzzx

We show that it is algebraically consistent to express some string fieldtheory operators as inner derivations of the B-V algebra of string vertices. Inthis approach, the recursion relations for the string vertices are found totake the form of a `geometrical' quantum master equation. We also show that theB-V delta operator cannot be an inner derivation on the algebra.
