Blocking transformation is performed in quantum field theory at finitetemperature. It is found that the manner temperature deforms the renormalizedtrajectories can be used to understand better the role played by the quantumfluctuations. In particular, it is conjectured that domain formation and massparameter generation can be observed in theories without spontaneous symmetrybreaking.
