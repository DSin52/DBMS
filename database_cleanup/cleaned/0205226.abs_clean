Title: Quantum Real Lines,Infinitesimal Structure of $\R$

Comments: 21 pages, Latex2e

We present in this paper quantum real lines as quantum defomations of thereal numbers $\R$.Upon deforming the Heisenberg algebra $\cL$ generated by $(a,a^\dagger)$ in terms of the Moyal $\ast$-product,we first construct q-deformedalgebras of q-differentiable functions in two cases where q is generic (not aroot of unity) and q is the N-th root of unity. We then investigate thesealgebras and finally propose two quantum real lines as the base spaces of thesealgebras. It is turned out that both quantum lines are discrete spaces and havenoncommutative structures.We further find, minimal length, fuzzy structure andinfinitesimal structure.
