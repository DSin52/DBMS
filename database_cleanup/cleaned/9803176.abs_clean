We explicitly demonstrate that the perturbative holomorphic contribution tothe off-shell effective action of N=2 U(1) gauge supermultiplet is an entireeffect of the minimal coupling to a hypermultiplet with the mass generated by acentral charge in N=2 superalgebra. The central charge is induced by a constantvacuum N=2 gauge superfield strength spontaneously breaking the automorphismU(1)_R symmetry of N=2 superalgebra. We use the manifestly off-shellsupersymmetric harmonic superspace techniques of quantum calculations with thecentral charge-massive hypermultiplet propagator.
