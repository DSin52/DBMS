A class of asymptotically free scalar theories with O(N) symmetry, definedvia the eigenpotentials of the Gaussian fixed point (Halpern-Huang directions),are investigated using renormalization group flow equations. Explicit solutionsfor the form of the potential in the nonperturbative infrared domain are foundin the large-N limit. In this limit, potentials without symmetry breakingessentially preserve their shape and undergo a mass renormalization which isgoverned only by the renormalization group distance parameter; as aconsequence, these scalar theories do not have a problem of naturalness.Symmetry-breaking potentials are found to be ``fine-tuned'' in the large-Nlimit in the sense that the nontrivial minimum vanishes exactly in the limit ofquantum theory and the potential becomes flat near the origin.
