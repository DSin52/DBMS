We discuss the asymptotic properties of quantum states density forfundamental (super) membrane in the semiclassical approach. The matching of BPSpart of spectrum for superstring and supermembrane gives the possibility to getstringy results via membrane calculations and vice versa. The brane-black holecorrespondence (on the level of black hole states and brane microstates) isalso studied.
