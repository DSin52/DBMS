We extend calculational techniques for static solitons to the case of fieldconfigurations with simple time dependence in order to consider quantum effectson the stability of Q-balls. These nontopological solitons exist classicallyfor any fixed value of an unbroken global charge Q. We show that one-loopquantum effects can destabilize very small Q-balls. We show how the propertiesof the soliton are reflected in the associated scattering problem, and findthat a good approximation to the full one-loop quantum energy of a Q-ball isgiven by $\omega - E_0$, where $\omega$ is the frequency of the classicalsoliton's time dependence, and $E_0$ is the energy of the lowest bound state inthe associated scattering problem.
