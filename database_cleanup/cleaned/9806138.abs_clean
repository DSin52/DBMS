We investigate the radiative decay of the axion into two photons in anexternal electromagnetic field to one loop order. Our approach is based on theworld-line formalism, which is very suitable to take into account the externalfield to all orders. Afterwards we discuss how the calculation could begeneralized to finite temperature.
