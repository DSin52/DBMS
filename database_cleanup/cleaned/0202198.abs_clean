Braneworld cosmology for a domain wall embedded in the charged (Anti)-deSitter-Schwarzschildblack hole of the five--dimensionalEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Maxwell theory is considered. The effective Friedmannequation for the brane is derived by introducing the necessary surfacecounterterms required for a well-defined variational principlein theGauss--Bonnet theory and for the finiteness of the bulk space. The asymptoticdynamics of the brane cosmology is determined and it is found that solutionswith vanishingly small spatial volume are unphysical. The finiteness of thebulk action is related to the vanishing of the effective cosmological constanton the brane. An analogy between the Friedmann equation and a generalizedCardy--Verlinde formula is drawn.
