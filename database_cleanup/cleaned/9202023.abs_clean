We consider a source of gravitational waves of frequency $\omega$, locatednear the center of a massive galaxy of mass $M$ and radius $R$, with $\omega\ggR^{-1}$. In the case of a perfect fluid galaxy, and of odd-parity waves, thereis no direct matter-wave interaction and the propagation of the waves isaffected by the galaxy only through the curvature of the spacetime backgroundthrough which the waves propagate. We find that, in addition to the expectedredshift of the radiation emerging from the galaxy, there is a small amount ofbackscatter, of order $M/\omega^2R^3$. We show that there is no suppression ofradiative power by the factor $1+\omega^2M^2/4$ as has been recently predictedby Kundu. The origin of Kundu's suppression lies in the interpretation of aterm in the expansion of the exterior field of the galaxy in inverse powers ofradius. It is shown why that term is not related to the source strength or tothe strength of the emerging radiation.
