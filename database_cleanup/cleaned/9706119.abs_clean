We give the complete list of all first-order consistent interaction verticesfor a set of exterior form gauge fields of form degree >1, described in thefree limit by the standard Maxwell-like action. A special attention is paid tothe interactions that deform the gauge transformations. These are shown to benecessarily of the Noether form "conserved antisymmetric tensor" times "p-formpotential" and exist only in particular spacetime dimensions. Conditions forconsistency to all orders in the coupling constant are given. For illustrativepurposes, the analysis is carried out explicitly for a system of forms with twodifferent degrees p and q (1<p<q<n).
