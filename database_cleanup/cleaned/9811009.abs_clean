We consider two different versions of gauged WZW theories with theexceptional groups and gauged with any of theirs null subgroups. Byconstructing suitable automorphism, we establish the equivalence of these twotheories. On the other hand our automorphism, relates the two dual irreducibleRiemannian globally symmetric spaces with different characters based on thecorresponding exceptional Lie groups.
