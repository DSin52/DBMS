We present the results of probing the ten dimensional type IIB supergravitysolution corresponding to a renormalisation group flow of supersymmetric SU(n)Yang-Mills theory from pure gauge N=4 to N=1 with two massless adjointflavours. The endpoint of the flow is an infrared fixed point theory, andbecause of this simplicity of the theory, the effective Lagrangian for theprobe is very well-behaved, having no zeros or singularities in the tension,and a smooth potential, all of which we exhibit. Specialising to the locus ofpoints where the potential vanishes, we also characterise a part of the Coulombbranch of the N=1 theory. The simplicity of the gauge theory physics allows usto isolate and emphasise a key holographic feature of brane probe physics whichhas wider applications in the study of geometry/gauge theory duals.
