We elucidate the interplay between gauge and supersymmetry anomalies insix-dimensional $N=1$ supergravity with generalized couplings between tensorand vector multiplets. We derive the structure of the five-dimensionalsupergravity resulting from the $S_1$ reduction of these models and give theconstraints on Chern-Simons couplings that follow from duality to $M$ theorycompactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold. The duality is supported only on arestricted class of Calabi-Yau threefolds and requires a special type ofintersection form. We derive five-dimensional central-charge formulas anddiscuss briefly the associated phase transitions. Finally, we exhibitconnections with $F$-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds thatadmit elliptic fibrations. This analysis suggests that $F$ theory unifiesType-$IIb$ three-branes and $M$-theory five-branes.
