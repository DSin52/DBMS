The problem of maintaining scale and conformal invariance in Maxwell andgeneral N-form gauge theories away from their critical dimension d=2(N+1) isanalyzed.We first exhibit the underlying group-theoretical clash betweenlocality,gauge,Lorentz and conformal invariance require- ments. "Improved"traceless stress tensors are then constructed;each violates one of the abovecriteria.However,when d=N+2,there is a duality equivalence between N-formmodels and massless scalars.Here we show that conformal invariance is notlost,by constructing a quasilocal gauge invariant improved stress tensor.Thecorrelators of the scalar theory are then reproduced,including the latter'strace anomaly.
