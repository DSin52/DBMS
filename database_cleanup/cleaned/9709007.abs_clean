The Matrix Darboux-Toda Mapping is represented as a product of a number ofcommutative mappings. The Matrix Davey-Stewartson Hierarchy is invariant withrespect to each of these mappings. We thus introduce an entirely new type ofdiscrete transformation for this hierarchy. The discrete transformation for theVector Nonlinear Shrodinger System coincides with one of the mappings undernecessary reduction conditions.
