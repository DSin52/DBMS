A static configuration of point charges held together by the gravitationalattraction is known to be given by the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution in theEinstein-Maxwell theory. We consider a generalization of this solution tonon-Abelian monopoles of the Yang-Mills Higgs system coupled to gravity. Thesolution is governed by an analog of the Bogomol'nyi equations that had playeda central role in the analysis of non-Abelian monopoles.
