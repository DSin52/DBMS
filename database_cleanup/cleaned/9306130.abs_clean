We propose a topological version of four-dimensional (Euclidean) Einsteingravity, in which anti-self-dual 2-forms and an SU(2) connection are used asfundamental fields. The theory describes the moduli space of conformallyself-dual Einstein manifolds. In the presence of a cosmological constant, weevaluate the index of the elliptic complex associated with the moduli space.
