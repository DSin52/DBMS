Comments: LaTex, 37 pages, no figures, Invited talk at the Quantum Gravity

Seminar in memory of academician Moisei Markov, June 12-19, 1995, Moscow;page format is changed, one reference is added and another one is correctedJournal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys. D5 (1996) 763-797

We review the theory of higher-spin gauge fields in four and three space-timedimensions and present some new results on higher-spin gauge interactions ofmatter fields in two dimensions.
