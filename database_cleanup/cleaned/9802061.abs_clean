We discuss in this paper the behaviour of minimal models of conformal theoryperturbed by the operator $\Phi_{13}$ at the boundary. Using the RSOSrestriction of the sine-Gordon model, adapted to the boundary problem, a seriesof boundary flows between different set of conformally invariant boundaryconditions are described. Generalizing the "staircase" phenomenon discovered byAl. Zamolodchikov, we find that an analytic continuation of the boundarysinh-Gordon model provides a flow interpolation not only between all minimalmodels in the bulk, but also between their possible conformal boundaryconditions. In the particular case where the bulk sinh-Gordon coupling isturned to zero, we obtain a boundary roaming trajectory in the $c=1$ theorythat interpolates between all the possible spin $S$ Kondo models.
