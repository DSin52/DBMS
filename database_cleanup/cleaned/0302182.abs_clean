Title: Tachyon Condensation and Universal Solutions in String Field Theory

Authors: Tomohiko Takahashi

Comments: 26 pages, 8 eps figures

We investigate a non-perturbative vacuum in open string field theory expandedaround the analytic classical solution which has been found in the universalFock space generated by matter Virasoro generators and ghost oscillators. Wecarry out level-truncation analyses up to level (6,18) in the theory aroundone-parameter families of the solution. We observe that the value of the vacuumenergy approaches the D-brane tension as the approximation level is increased,but this non-perturbative vacuum disappears at the boundary of the parameterspace. These results provide strong evidence for the conjecture that, althoughthe universal solutions are pure gauge in almost all the parameter space, theyare regarded as the tachyon vacuum solution at the boundary.
