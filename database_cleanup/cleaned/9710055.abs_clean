The time-dependent variational principle proposed by Balian and Veneroni isused to provide the best approximation to the generating functional formulti-time Green's functions of a set of (bosonic) observables $Q_{\mu)$. Bysuitably restricting the trial spaces, the computation of the two-time Green'sfunction, obtained by a second order expansion in the sources, is considerablysimplified. This leads to a tractable formalism suited to quantum fields outof equilibrium. We propose an illustration on the finite temperature${\bf\Phi^4}$ theory in curved space and coupled to gravity.
