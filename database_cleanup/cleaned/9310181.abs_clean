We show how two-dimensional incompressible quantum fluids and theirexcitations can be viewed as $\ W_{1+\infty}\ $ edge conformal field theories,thereby providing an algebraic characterization of incompressibility. TheKac-Radul representation theory of the $\ W_{1+\infty}\ $ algebra leads then toa purely algebraic complete classification of hierarchical quantum Hall states,which encompasses all measured fractions. Spin-polarized electrons insingle-layer devices can only have Abelian anyon excitations.
