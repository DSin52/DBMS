We construct a model describing BPS brane-systems using low energy effectivetheory of brane-antibrane system. Both parallel branes and intersecting branescan be treated by this model. After tachyon condensation, the dynamics offluctuations around such brane-systems is supersymmetric if the degrees offreedom are restricted on the branes. The form of the tachyon potential and theapplication of this model to the black hole physics are discussed.
