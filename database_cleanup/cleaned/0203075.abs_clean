451-459We consider the XXZ model for a chain of particles whose spins are arbitrarywith the anisotropy parameter equal to the root of minus one and generalizedperiodic boundary conditions. The conditions for the truncation of thefunctional fusion relations of the transfer matrices are obtained. Thetruncation results in a closed system of equations whose solution allowsobtaining the energy spectrum.
