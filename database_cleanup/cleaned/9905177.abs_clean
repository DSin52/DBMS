We conjecture the following entropy bound to be valid in all space-timessurface. Let L be a hypersurface generated by surface-orthogonal null geodesicswith non-positive expansion. Let S be the entropy on L. Then S does not exceedA/4.We present evidence that the bound can be saturated, but not exceeded, incosmological solutions and in the interior of black holes. For systems withlimited self-gravity it reduces to Bekenstein's bound. Because the conjectureis manifestly time reversal invariant, its origin cannot be thermodynamic, butmust be statistical. Thus it places a fundamental limit on the number ofdegrees of freedom in nature.
