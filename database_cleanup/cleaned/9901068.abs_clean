We show that an essential assumption in the Vafa and Witten's theorem on Pand CT realization in vector-like theories, the existence of a free energydensity in Euclidean space in the presence of any external hermitian symmetrybreaking source, does not apply if the symmetry is spontaneously broken. Theassumption that the free energy density is well defined requires the previousassumption that the symmetry is realized in the vacuum. Even if Vafa andWitten's conjecture is plausible, actually a theorem is still lacking.
