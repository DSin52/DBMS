Title: Towards the Realistic Gluodynamics String. Perturbative Gluons'

Contribution to the String Effective ActionComments: 8 pages, LaTeX, no figures

Perturbation theory in the nonperturbative QCD vacuum and the non-AbelianStokes theorem, representing a Wilson loop in the SU(2) gluodynamics as anintegral over all the orientations in colour space, are applied to derivationof the correction to the background-induced string effective action. Thiscorrection is due to accounting in the lowest order of perturbation theory forthe interaction of perturbative gluons with the string world sheet. It occursthat this interaction affects only the coupling constant of the rigidity term,while its contribution to the string tension of the Nambu-Goto term vanishes.The obtained correction to the rigid string coupling constant multiplicativelydepends on the spin of the representation of the Wilson loop underconsideration, the QCD coupling constant and a certain path integral, whichincludes the background Wilson average.
