Covariantly we reformulate the description of a spinning particle in terms ofthe Poincar\'{e} group. We also construct a Lagrangian which entails allpossible constraints explicitly; all constraints can be obtained just from theLagrangian. Furthermore, in this covariant reformulation, the Lorentz elementis to be considered to evolve the momentum or spin component from an arbitraryfixed frame and not just from the particle rest frame. In distinction with theusual formulation, our system is directly comparable with the pseudo-classicalformulation. We get a peculiar symmetry which resembles the supersymmetry ofthe pseudo-classical formulation.
