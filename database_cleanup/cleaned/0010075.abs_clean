We study the two-point function for the gauge boson in the axial-type gauges.We use the exact treatment of the axial gauges recently proposed that isintrinsically compatible with the Lorentz type gauges in the path-integralformulation and has been arrived at from this connection and which is a``one-vector'' treatment. We find that in this treatment, we can evaluate thetwo-point functions without imposing any additional interpretation on the axialgauge 1/(n.q)^p-type poles. The calculations are as easy as the othertreatments based on other known prescriptions. Unlike the``uniform-prescription'' /L-M prescription, we note, here, the absence of anynon-local divergences in the 2-point proper vertex. We correlate ourcalculation with that for the Cauchy Principal Value prescription and find fromthis comparison that the 2-point proper vertex differs from the CPV calculationonly by finite terms. For simplicity of treatment, the divergences have beencalculated here with n^2>0 and these have a smooth light cone limit.
