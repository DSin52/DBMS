We present a self-tuning solution of the cosmological constant problem withone extra dimension which is curved with a warp factor. To separate out theextra dimension and to have a self-tuning solution, a three index antisymmetrictensor field is introduced with the $1/H^2$ term in the Lagrangian. Thestandard model fields are located at the $y=0$ brane. The existence\cite{kklcc} of the self-tuning solution (which results without any fine tuningamong parameters in the Lagrangian) is crucial to obtain a vanishingcosmological constant in a 4D effective theory. The de Sitter and anti deSitter space solutions are possible. The de Sitter space solutions havehorizons. Restricting to the spaces which contain the $y=0$ brane, thevanishing cosmological constant is chosen in the most probable universe. Forthis interpretaion to be valid, the existence of the self-tuning solution iscrucial in view of the phase transitions. In this paper, we show explicitly asolution in case the brane tension shifts from one to another value. We alsodiscuss the case with the $H^2$ term which leads to one-fine-tuning solutionsat most.
