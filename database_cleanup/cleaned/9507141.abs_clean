In the 1-dimensional matrix model one identifies the tachyon field in theasymptotic region with a nonlocal transform of the density of fermions. Butthere is a problem in relating the classical tachyon field with the surfaceprofile of the fermi fluid if a fold forms in the fermi surface. Besides thecollective field additional variables $w_j(x)$ are required to describe folds.In the quantum theory we show that the $w_j$ are the quantum dispersions of thecollective field. These dispersions become $O(1)$ rather than $O(\hbar)$precisely after fold formation, thus giving additional `classical' quantitiesand leading to a rather nontrivial classical limit. A coherent pulse reflectingfrom the potential wall turns into high energy incoherent quanta (if a foldforms), the frequency amplification being of the order of the square root ofthe number of quanta in the incident wave.
