We extend previous work on the IR regime approximation of QCD in which thedominant contribution comes from a dressed two-gluon effective metric-likefield $G_{\mu\nu} = g_{ab} B^{a}_{\mu} B^{b}_{\nu}$ ($g_{ab}$ a color $SU(3)$metric). The ensuring effective theory is represented by apseudo-diffeomorphisms gauge theory. The second -quantized $G_{\mu\nu}$ field,together with the Lorentz generators close on the $\overline{SL}(4,R)$ algebra.This algebra represents a spectrum generating algebra for the set of hadronstates of a given flavor - hadronic "manifields" transforming w.r.t.$\overline{SL}(4,R)$ (infinite-dimensional) unitary irreduciblerepresentations. The equations of motion for the effective pseudo-gravity arederived from a quadratic action describing Riemannian pseudo-gravity in thepresence of shear ($\overline{SL}(4,R)$ covariant) hadronic matter currents.These equations yield $p^{-4}$ propagators, i.e. a linearly rising confiningpotential $H(r) \sim r$, as well as linear $J \sim m^{2}$ Regge trajectories.The $\overline{SL}(4,R)$ symmetry based dynamical theory for the QCD IR regionis applied to hadron resonances. All presently known meson and baryonresonances are successfully accommodated and various missing states predicted.(Lectures presented at the Danube Workshop '93, June 1993, Belgrade,Yugoslavia.)
