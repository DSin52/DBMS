We consider the long range forces between two BPS particles on the Coulombbranch of N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories. The 1/r potential isunambiguously fixed, even at strong coupling, by the moduli dependence ofcentral charges supported by the BPS states. The effective Coulombic couplingvanishes on marginal stability curves, while sign changes on crossing thesecurves explain the restructuring of the spectrum of composite BPS states. Thisrestructuring proceeds via the delocalization of the composite state onapproach to the curve of marginal stability. Therefore the spectrum of BPSstates can be inferred by analyzing the submanifolds of the moduli space wherethe long range potential is attractive. This method also allows us to findcertain non-BPS bound states and their stability domains. As examples, weconsider the dissociation of the W boson and higher charge dyons at strongcoupling in N=2 SU(2) SYM, quark-monopole bound states in N=2 SYM with oneflavor, and composite dyons in N=2 SU(3) SYM.
