Title: On Critical Phenomena in a Noncommutative Space

Authors: Guang-Hong Chen and Yong-Shi Wu

Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures, the relevance of star product structure in low

energy effective theory is clarified, the presentation is improvedIn this paper we demonstrate that coordinate noncommutativity at shortdistances can show up in critical phenomena through UV-IR mixing. In thesymmetric phase of the Landau-Ginsburg model, noncommutativity is shown to giverise to a non-zero anomalous dimension at one loop, and to cause instabilitytowards a new phase at large noncommutativity. In particular, in less than fourdimensions, the one-loop critical exponent $\eta$ is non-vanishing at theWilson-Fisher fixed point.
