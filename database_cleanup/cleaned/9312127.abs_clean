Title: Black Hole Evaporation along Macroscopic Strings

Authors: A. Lawrence and E. Martinec

Comments: 26pp, EFI 93-73. (Original claim that string Hawking flux exceeds

spacetime flux is WRONG. It is the same; revised version provides correctargument and additional comments.)Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D50 (1994) 2680-2691

We develop the quantization of a macroscopic string which extends radiallyfrom a Schwarzschild black hole. The Hawking process excites a thermal bath ofstring modes that causes the black hole to lose mass. The resulting typicalstring configuration is a random walk in the angular coordinates. We show thatthe energy flux in string excitations is approximately that of spacetime fieldmodes.
