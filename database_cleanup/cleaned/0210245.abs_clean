We study the decay of a very massive closed superstring (i.e. \alpha' M^2>>1) in the unique state of maximum angular momentum. This is done in flatten-dimensional spacetime and in the regime of weak string coupling, where thedominant decay channel is into two states of masses M_1, M_2. We find that theWe also compute the decay rate for each values of M_1, M_2. We find that, forwhich are exponentially suppressed, for every decay into a state of given massM_1, the mass M_2 of the other state is uniquely determined.
