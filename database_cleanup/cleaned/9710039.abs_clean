Just like decent classical difference-difference systems define symplecticmaps on suitable phase spaces, their counterparts with properly orderednoncommutative entries come as Heisenberg equations of motion for correspondingquantum discrete-discrete models. We observe how this idea applies to adifference-difference counterpart of the Liouville equation. We produceexplicit forms of of its evolution operator for the two natural space-timecoordinate systems. We discover that discrete-discrete models inherit crucialfeatures of their continuous-time parents like locality and integrability whilethe new-found algebraic transparency promises a useful progress in somebranches of Quantum Inverse Scattering Method.
