It is shown that the never ending oscillatory behaviour of the genericsolution, near a cosmological singularity, of the massless bosonic sector ofsuperstring theory can be described as a billiard motion within a simplex in9-dimensional hyperbolic space. The Coxeter group of reflections of thisbilliard is discrete and is the Weyl group of the hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebraE$_{10}$ (for type II) or BE$_{10}$ (for type I or heterotic), which are botharithmetic. These results lead to a proof of the chaotic (``Anosov'') nature ofthe classical cosmological oscillations, and suggest a ``chaotic quantumbilliard'' scenario of vacuum selection in string theory.
