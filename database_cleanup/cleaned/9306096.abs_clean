Recently Witten proposed to consider elliptic genus in $N=2$ superconformalfield theory to understand the relation between $N=2$ minimal models andLandau-Ginzburg theories. In this paper we first discuss the basic propertiessatisfied by elliptic genera in $N=2$ theories. These properties are confirmedby some fundamental class of examples. Then we introduce a generic procedure tocompute the elliptic genera of a particular class of orbifold theories, {\iti.e.\/} the ones orbifoldized by $e^{2\pi iJ_0}$ in the Neveu-Schwarz sector.This enables us to calculate the elliptic genera for Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds.When the Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds allow an interpretation as target manifoldswith $SU(N)$ holonomy we can compare the expressions with the ones obtained byorbifoldizing tensor products of $N=2$ minimal models. We also give sigma modelexpressions of the elliptic genera for manifolds of $SU(N)$ holonomy.
