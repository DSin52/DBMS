Using Kaluza-Klein technique we show that the singularity of Hawking-Turoktype has a fixed point (bolt) contribution to the action in addition to theusual boundary contribution. Interestingly by adding this contribution we canobtain a simple expression for the total action which is feasible for bothregular and singular instantons. Our result casts doubt on the constraintproposed by Turok in the recent calculation in which Vilenkin's instantons areregarded as a limit of certain constrained instantons.
