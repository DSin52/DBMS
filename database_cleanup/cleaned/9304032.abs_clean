We examine the dynamics of a free massless scalar field on a figure eightnetwork. Upon requiring the scalar field to have a well defined value at thejunction of the network, it is seen that the conserved currents of the theorysatisfy Kirchhoff's law, that is that the current flowing into the junctionequals the current flowing out. We obtain the corresponding current algebra andshow that, unlike on a circle, the left- and right-moving currents on thefigure eight do not in general commute in quantum theory. Since a free scalarfield theory on a one dimensional spatial manifold exhibits conformal symmetry,it is natural to ask whether an analogous symmetry can be defined for thefigure eight. We find that, unlike in the case of a manifold, the action plusboundary conditions for the network are not invariant under separate conformaltransformations associated with left- and right-movers. Instead, the system is,at best, invariant under only a single set of transformations. Its conservedcurrent is also found to satisfy Kirchhoff's law at the junction. We obtain theassociated conserved charges, and show that they generate a Virasoro algebra.Its conformal anomaly (central charge) is computed for special values of theparameters characterizing the network.
