We propose a mechanism to break the translational invariance of compactifiedspace spontaneously. As a simple model, we study a real $\phi^4$ modelcompactified on $M^{D-1}\otimes S^1$ in detail, where we impose a nontrivialboundary condition on $\phi$ for the $S^1$-direction. It is shown that thetranslational invariance for the $S^1$-direction is spontaneously broken whenthe radius $R$ of $S^1$ becomes larger than a critical radius $R^*$ and alsothat the model behaves like a $\phi^4$ model on a single kink background for $R\to \infty$. It is pointed out that spontaneous breakdown of translationalinvariance is accompanied by that of some global symmetries, in general, in ourmechanism.
