on "Integrability, topological solitons and beyond"The topology of configuration space may be responsible in part for theexistence of sphalerons. Here, sphalerons are defined to be static but unstablefinite-energy solutions of the classical field equations. Another manifestationof the nontrivial topology of configuration space is the phenomenon of spectralflow for the eigenvalues of the Dirac Hamiltonian. The spectral flow, in turn,is related to the possible existence of anomalies. In this review, theinterconnection of these topics is illustrated for three particular sphaleronsof SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory.
