We discuss bosonic and supersymmetric Yang-Mills matrix models with compactsemi-simple gauge group. We begin by finding convergence conditions for thepartition and correlation functions. Moving on, we specialise to the SU(N)models with large N. In both the Yang-Mills and cohomological formulations, wefind all quantities which are invariant under the supercharges. Finally, weapply the deformation method of Moore, Nekrasov and Shatashvili directly to theYang-Mills model. We find a deformation of the action which generates massterms for all the matrix fields whilst preserving some supersymmetry. Thisallows us to rigorously integrate over a BRST quartet and arrive at the wellknown formula of MNS.
