We present two new classes of axisymmetric stationary solutions of theEinstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations with coupling constant $\alpha^2=3$. Bothclasses are written in terms of two harmonic maps $\lambda$ and $\tau$.$\lambda$ determines the gravitational potential and $\tau$ the electromagneticone in such a form that we can have an arbitrary electromagnetic field. Asexamples we generate two solutions with mass ($M$), rotation ($s$) and scalar($\delta$) parameters, one with electric charge ($q$) another one with magneticdipole ($Q$) parameter. The first solution contains the Kerr metric for$q=\delta=0$.
