We define consistent finite-superfields reductions of the $N=1,2$ super-KPhierarchies via the coset approach we already developped for reducing thebosonic KP-hierarchy (generating e.g. the NLS hierarchy from the$sl(2)/U(1)-{\cal KM}$ coset). We work in a manifestly supersymmetric frameworkand illustrate our method by treating explicitly the $N=1,2$ super-NLShierarchies. W.r.t. the bosonic case the ordinary covariant derivative is nowreplaced by a spinorial one containing a spin ${\textstyle {1\over 2}}$superfield. Each coset reduction is associated to a rational super-$\cw$algebra encoding a non-linear super-$\cw_\infty$ algebra structure. In the$N=2$ case two conjugate sets of superLax operators, equations of motion andinfinite hamiltonians in involution are derived. Modified hierarchies areobtained from the original ones via free-fields mappings (just as a m-NLSequation arises by representing the $sl(2)-{\cal KM}$ algebra through theclassical Wakimoto free-fields).
