Two dimensional dilaton gravity interacting with a four-fermion model andscalars is investigated, all the coefficients of the Lagrangian being arbitraryfunctions of the dilaton field. The one-loop covariant effective action for 2Ddilaton gravity with Majorana spinors (including the four-fermion interaction)is obtained, and the technical problems which appear in an attempt atgeneralizing such calculations to the case of the most general four-fermionmodel described by Dirac fermions are discussed. A solution to these problemsis found, based on its reduction to the Majorana spinor case.The general covariant effective action for 2D dilaton gravity with thefour-fermion model described by Dirac spinors is given. The one-looprenormalization of dilaton gravity with Majorana spinors is carried out and thespecific conditions for multiplicative renormalizability are found. Acomparison with the same theory but with a classical gravitational field isdone.
