The transparent way for the invariant (Hamiltonian) description ofequivariant localization of the integrals over phase space is proposed. It usesthe odd symplectic structure, constructed over tangent bundle of the phasespace and permits straightforward generalization for the path integrals.Simultaneously the method of supersymmetrization for a wide class of theHamiltonian systems is derived.
