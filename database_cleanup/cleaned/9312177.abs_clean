We define a new mathematical structure ( graph quantum group) which combinesthe tower of algebras associated with a graph ${\cal G}$ and the structure of aHopf algebra {\cal A}. In this structure Ocneanu's string operators become Hopfalgebra intertwiners. We present some examples of graph quantum groups.
