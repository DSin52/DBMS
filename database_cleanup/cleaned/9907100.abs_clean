We discuss the relation between the Matrix theory definitions of a class ofdecoupled theories and their AdS/CFT description in terms of the correspondingnear-horizon geometry. The near horizon geometry, naively part of the Coulombbranch, is embedded in the Higgs branch via a natural change of variables. Theprinciples of the map apply to all DLCQ descriptions in terms of hyper-K\"ahlerquotients, such as the ADHM quantum mechanics for the D1-D5 system. We thenfocus the (2,0) field theory, and obtain an explicit mapping from all states inthe $N_0=1$ momentum sector of $N_4$ M5-branes to states in (a DLCQ version of)$AdS_7\times S^4$. We show that, even for a single D0-brane, the space-timecoordinates become non-commuting variables, suggesting an inherentnon-commutativity of space-time in the presence of field strengths even fortheories with gravity.
