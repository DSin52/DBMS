The effective potential of composite fermion fields in three-dimensionalThirring model in curved spacetime is calculated in linear curvatureapproximation. The phase transition accompanied by the creation of non-zerochiral invariant bifermionic vector-like condensate is shown to exist. The typeof this phase transition is discussed.
