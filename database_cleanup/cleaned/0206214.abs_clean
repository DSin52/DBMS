A connection between weak and strong tension limits and their perturbativecorrections is discussed. New twistor-like models based on D=4, N=1 tensionlesssuperstring and superbrane with tensor central charges are studied. Thepresence of three, two or less preserved fractions of $\kappa-$symmetry in theactions free of the Wess-Zumino terms is shown. A correlation of extra$\kappa-$symmetry with the R-symmetry is established. The equations of thesuperstring and superbrane models preserving 3/4 supersymmetry are exactlysolved. The general solution for the Goldstone fermion is pure static, but forthe Goldstone bosons it also includes a term describing string/brane motionsalong the fixed directions given by the initial data. These solutionscorrespond to the partial spontaneous breaking of the D=4, N=1 globalsupersymmetry and can be associated with a static closed magneticNielsen-Olesen vortex or a p-dimensional vortex.
