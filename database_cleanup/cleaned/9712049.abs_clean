We examine several aspects of the formulation of M(atrix)-Theory on ALEspaces. We argue for the existence of massless vector multiplets in theresolved $A_{n-1}$ spaces, as required by enhanced gauge symmetry in M-Theory,and that these states might have the correct gravitational interactions. Wepropose a matrix model which describes M-Theory on an ALE space in the presenceof wrapped membranes. We also consider orbifold descriptions of matrix stringtheories, as well as more exotic orbifolds of these models, and present aclassification of twisted matrix string theories according to Reid's exactsequences of surface quotient singularities.
