Using holographic renormalization, we study correlation functions throughouta renormalization group flow between two-dimensional superconformal fieldtheories. The ultraviolet theory is an N=(4,4) CFT which can be thought of as asymmetric product of U(2) super WZW models. It is perturbed by a relevantoperator which preserves one-quarter supersymmetry and drives the theory to aninfrared fixed point. We compute correlators of the stress-energy tensor and ofthe relevant operators dual to supergravity scalars. Using the former, we puttogether Zamolodchikov's C function, and contrast it with proposals for aholographic C function. In passing, we address and resolve two puzzles alsofound in the case of five-dimensional bulk supergravity.
