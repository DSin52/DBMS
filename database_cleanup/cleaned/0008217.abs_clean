Title: On the universality of string theory

Authors: Karl-Georg Schlesinger

Comments: 15 pages

String theory is accused by some of its critics to be a purely abstractmathematical discipline, having lost the contact to the simple yet deeplyrooted questions which physics provided until the beginning of this century. Weargue that, in contrary, there are indications that string theory might belinked to a fundamental principle of a quantum computational character. Inaddition, the nature of this principle might be capable to provide some newinsight into the question of universality of string theory.
