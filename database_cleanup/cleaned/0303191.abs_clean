Authors: F. Bigazzi, A. L. Cotrone, M. Petrini and A. Zaffaroni

Comments: 85 pages, 1 figure; review article to be published in Rivista del

Nuovo CimentoThis article contains an overview of some recent attempts at understandingsupergravity and string duals of four dimensional gauge theories using theAdS/CFT correspondence. We discuss the general philosophy underlying thevarious ways to realize Super Yang-Mills theories in terms of systems ofbranes. We then review some of the existing duals for N=2 and N=1 theories. Wealso discuss differences and similarities with realistic theories.
