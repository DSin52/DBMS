In this note we update the discussion of the BMN correspondence and stringinteractions in hep-th/0205089 to incorporate the effects of operator mixing.We diagonalize the matrix of two point functions of single and double traceoperators, and compute the eigen-operators and their anomalous dimensions toorder g_2^2 \lambda'. Surprisingly, operators in different R symmetrymultiplets remain degenerate at this order. We also calculate the correspondingenergy shifts in string theory, and find a discrepancy with field theoryresults, indicating possible new effects in light-cone string field theory.
