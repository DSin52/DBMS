Symposium in College Park, Maryland, USABorn-Infeld theory is the non-linear generalization of Maxwellelectrodynamics. It naturally arises as the low-energy effective action of openstrings, and it is also part of the world-volume effective action of D-branes.The N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric generalizations of the Born-Infeld action areclosely related to partial spontaneous breaking of rigid extendedsupersymmetry. We review some remarkable features of the Born-Infeld action andoutline its supersymmetric generalizations in four dimensions. The non-abelianN=1 supersymmetric extension of the Born-Infeld theory and its N=1supergravitational avatars are given in superspace.
