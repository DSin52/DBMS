We study the structure of holomorphic effective action for hypermultipletmodels interacting with background super Yang-Mills fields. A general form ofholomorphic effective action is found for hypermultiplet belonging to arbitraryrepresentation of any semisimple compact Lie group spontaneously broken to itsmaximal abelian subgroup. The applications of obtained results tohypermultiplets in fundamental and adjoint representations of the SU(n), SO(n),Sp(n) groups are considered.
