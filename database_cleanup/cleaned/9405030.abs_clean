We describe the construction of trigonometric R-matrices corresponding to the(multiplicity-free) tensor product of any two irreducible representations of aquantum algebra $U_q(\G)$. Our method is a generalization of the tensor productgraph method to the case of two different representations. It yields thedecomposition of the R-matrix into projection operators. Many new examples oftrigonometric R-matrices (solutions to the spectral parameter dependentYang-Baxter equation) are constructed using this approach.
