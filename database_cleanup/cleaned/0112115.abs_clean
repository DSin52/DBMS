Four dimensional gravity in the low energy limit of a higher dimensionaltheory has been expected to be a (generalized) Brans-Dicke theory. A subtlepoint in brane world scenarios is that the system of four dimensional effectivegravitational equations is not closed due to bulk gravitational waves and bulkscalars. Nonetheless, weak gravity on the brane can be analyzed completely. Werevisit the theory of weak brane gravity using gauge-invariant gravitationaland scalar perturbations around a background warped geometry with a bulk scalarbetween two flat branes. We obtain a simple condition for the radionstabilization in terms of the scalar field potentials. We show that for generalpotentials of the scalar field which provides radion stabilization and ageneral conformal transformation to a frame in which matter on the branes areminimally coupled to the metric, 4-dimensional Einstein gravity, not BDgravity, is restored at low energies on either brane. In contrast, in RS braneworld scenario without a bulk scalar, low energy gravity is BD one. Weconjecture that in general brane world scenarios with more than one scalarfield, one will again encounter the situation that low energy gravity is notdescribed by the Einstein theory. Equipped with the weak gravity results, wediscuss the properties of 4d brane gravitational equations, in particular, thevalue and sign of 4d Newton's gravitational coupling.
