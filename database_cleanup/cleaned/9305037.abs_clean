We give a direct proof of the new "product" expression for the Ramond sectorcharacters of N=2 minimal models recently suggested by E. Witten. Ourconstruction allows us to generalize these expressions to the D and E series ofN=2 minimal models, as well as to other N=2 Kazama--Suzuki coset models such as$SU(N)\times SO(2(N-1))/SU(N-1)\times U(1)$. We verify that these expressionsindeed coincide with the corresponding Landau--Ginzburg "elliptic genus", acertain topologically invariant twisted path integral with the effectiveLandau--Ginzburg action, which we obtain by using Witten's method. We indicatehow our approach may be used to construct (or rule out) possibleLandau--Ginzburg potentials for describing other N=2 superconformal theories.
