Title: Generalized Eulerian Coordinates for Relativistic Fluids

Rest-Frame Instant Form, Relative Variables, Rotational KinematicsAuthors: David Alba (Universita' di Firenze), Luca Lusanna (INFN, Firenze)

Comments: 78 pages, revised introduction

We study the rest-frame instant form of a new formulation of relativisticperfect fluids in terms of new generalized Eulerian configuration coordinates.After the separation of the relativistic center of mass from the relativevariables on the Wigner hyper-planes, we define orientational and shapevariables for the fluid, viewed as a relativistic extended deformable body, byintroducing dynamical body frames. Finally we define Dixon's multipoles for thefluid.
