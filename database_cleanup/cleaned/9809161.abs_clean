We describe the application of methods from the study of discrete dynanmicalsystems to the problem of the continuum limit of evolving spin networks. Thesehave been found to describe the small scale structure of quantum generalrelativity and extensions of them have been conjectured to give backgroundindependent formulations of string theory. We explain why the the usualequilibrium critical phenomena may not be relevant for the problem of thecontinuum limit of such theories and why, instead, the continuum limits of suchtheories are likely to be governed by non-equilibrium critical phenomena suchas directed percolation. The fact that such non-equilibrium critical phenomenacan be self-organized implies the possibility that the classical limit ofquantum theories of gravity may exist without fine tuning of parameters.
