In this paper we describe explicitly how the twisted ``bundles'' on a D-braneworldvolume in the presence of a nontrivial B field, can be understood in termsof sheaves on stacks. We also take this opportunity to provide the physicscommunity with a readable introduction to stacks and generalized spaces.
