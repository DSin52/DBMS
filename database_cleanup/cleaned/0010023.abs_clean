Armed with the explicit computation of Schur Multipliers, we offer aclassification of SU(n) orbifolds for n = 2,3,4 which permit the turning on ofdiscrete torsion. This is in response to the host of activity lately in vogueon the application of discrete torsion to D-brane orbifold theories. As aby-product, we find a hitherto unknown class of N = 1 orbifolds with non-cyclicdiscrete torsion group. Furthermore, we supplement the status quo ante byinvestigating a first example of a non-Abelian orbifold admitting discretetorsion, namely the ordinary dihedral group as a subgroup of SU(3). Acomparison of the quiver theory thereof with that of its covering group, thebinary dihedral group, without discrete torsion, is also performed.
