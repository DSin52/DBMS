The `strong-coupling' perturbation theory over the inverse interactionconstant $1/g$ near the nontrivial solution of Lagrange equation is formulated.The ordinary `week-coupling' perturbation theory over $g$ is described also tocompare both perturbation theories. The `strong-coupling' perturbation theoryis developed by unitary mapping of the quantum dynamics into the space withlocal coordinates of (action, angle)-type.
