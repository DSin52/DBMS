We use wrapped D-brane probes to measure position dependent perturbations ofcompactification moduli. Due to the backreaction of the D-branes on the localgeometry, we suspect that measuring the fluctuations of one modulus to highprecision will generically affect the others. These considerations lead us toconjecture a novel uncertainty principle on the Calabi-Yau moduli space. Webegin our investigation with a gedanken experiment on a torus.
