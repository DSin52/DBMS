Extending a recent result of S.B. Giddings, F. Hacquebord and H. Verlinde, weshow that in the U(N) SYM Matrix theory there exist classical BPS instantonswhich interpolate between different closed string configurations viajoining/splitting interactions similar to those of string field theory. Weconstruct them starting from branched coverings of Riemann surfaces. For theclass of them which we analyze in detail the construction can be made explicitin terms U(N) affine Toda field theories.
