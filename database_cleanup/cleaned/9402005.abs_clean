We investigate the field dependence of the gauge couplings of locallysupersymmetric effective quantum field theories. We find that the Weylrescaling of supergravity gives rise to Wess-Zumino terms that affect the gaugecouplings at the one-loop level. These Wess-Zumino terms are crucial inassuring supersymmetric consistency of both perturbative and non-perturbativegauge interactions. At the perturbative level, we distinguish between theholomorphic Wilsonian gauge couplings and the physically-measurablemomentum-dependent effective gauge couplings; the latter are affected by theKonishi and the super-Weyl anomalies and their field-dependence isnon-holomorphic. At the non-perturbative level, we show how consistency of thescalar potential generated by infrared-strong gauge interactions with the localsupersymmetry requires a very specific form of the effective superpotential. Weuse this superpotential to determine the dependence of the supersymmetriccondensates of a strongly interacting gauge theory on its (field-dependent)Wilsonian gauge coupling and the Yukawa couplings of the matter fields. Thearticle concludes with the discussion of the field-dependent non-perturbativephenomena in the context of string unification.
