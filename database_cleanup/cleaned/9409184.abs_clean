Moddings by cyclic permutation symmetries are performed in 4-dimensionalstrings, built up from N=2 coset models of the type $CP_m=SU(m+1)/SU(m)\timesU(1)$. For some exemplifying cases, the massless chiral and antichiral statesof $E_6$ are computed. The extent of the equivalence between differentconformal invariant theories which possess equal chiral rings is analyzed.
