Title: An interpolation between Bose, Fermi and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics

based on Jack PolynomialsAuthors: S. Chaturvedi and V. Srinivasan

Comments: 9 pages, latex, no figures. A typographical error in the stated

properties of Jack polynomials has been correctedAn interpolation between the canonical partition functions of Bose, Fermi andMaxwell-Boltzmann statistics is proposed. This interpolation makes use of theproperties of Jack polynomials and leads to a physically appealinginterpolation between the statistical weights of the three statistics. This, inturn, can be used to define a new exclusion statistics in the spirit of thework of Haldane.
