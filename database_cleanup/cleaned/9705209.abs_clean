Comments: 79 pages, Latex, 4 eps-figs, PhD thesis; typos corrected

We investigate quantum aspects of the three dimensional (BTZ) black holes.scalar fields and the string theory in the three dimensional black holebackgrounds. We take two approaches to the thermodynamics. In one approach weuse mode expansion, and in the other we use Hartle-Hawking Green functions. Weobtain exact expressions of mode functions, Hartle-Hawking Green functions,Green functions on a cone geometry, and thermodynamic quantities. The entropiesdepend largely upon methods of calculation including regularization schemes andboundary conditions. This indicates the importance of precise discussions onthe definition of the thermodynamic quantities for understanding black holeentropy. Then we investigate the string theory in the framework of conformalfield theory. The model is described by an orbifold of the SL(2,R) WZW model.We discuss the spectrum by solving the level matching condition and obtainwinding modes. We analyze the physical states and investigate the ghostproblem. Explicit examples of negative-norm physical states (ghosts) are found.Thus we discuss possibilities for obtaining a sensible theory. The tachyonpropagation and the target-space geometry are also discussed. This is the firstattempt to quantize a string in a black hole background with an infinite numberof propagating modes. Although we cannot overcome all the problems, our resultsmay provide a useful basis for both subjects.
