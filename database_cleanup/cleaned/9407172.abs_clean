INFN-NA-IV-94/33,DSF-T-94/33Photon distribution function, means and dispersions are found explicitly forthe nonclassical state of light which is created from the photon--addedcoherent state $\vert \alpha,m \rangle$ due to a time--dependence of thefrequency of the electromagnetic field oscillator. Generating function forfactorial momenta is obtained. The Wigner function and Q--function areconstructed explicitly for the excited photon--added coherent state of light.Influence of added photons on known oscillations of photon distributionfunction for squeezed light is demonstrated. oscillator are considered.
