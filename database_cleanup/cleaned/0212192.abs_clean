Title: Supersymmetry in quantum mechanics with point interactions

Authors: Tomoaki Nagasawa, Makoto Sakamoto and Kazunori Takenaga

Comments: 12 pages, no figures. Some sections are improved and new references

are addedWe investigate supersymmetry in one-dimensional quantum mechanics with pointinteractions. We clarify a class of point interactions compatible withsupersymmetry and present N=2 supersymmetric models on a circle with two pointinteractions as well as a superpotential. A hidden $su(2)$ structure inherentin the system plays a crucial role to construct the N=2 supercharges.Spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry due to point interactions is alsodiscussed.
