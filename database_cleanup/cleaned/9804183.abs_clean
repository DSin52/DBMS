A non standard super extensions of the Poincare algebra (S-algebra [1,2]),which seems to be relevant for construction of various D=11 models, arestudied. We present two examples of actions for point-like dynamical systems,which are invariant under off-shell closed realization of the S-algebra as wellas under local fermionic $\kappa$-symmetry. On this ground, an explicit form ofthe S-algebra is advocated.
