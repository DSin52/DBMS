We consider the possibility of localizing gravity on a Nielsen-Olesen vortexin the context of the Abelian Higgs model. The vortex lives in asix-dimensional space-time with negative bulk cosmological constant. In thismodel we find a region of the parameter space leading, simultaneously, towarped compactification and to regular space-time geometry. A thin defect limitis studied. Regular solutions describing warped compactifications in the caseof higher winding number are also presented.
