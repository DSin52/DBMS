Title: Phase operator problem and an index theorem for Q-deformed oscillator

Comments: 13 pages. A misprint in eq.(40) in the original version was corrected

The notion of index is applied to analyze the phase operator problemassociated with the photon. We clarify the absence of the hermitian phaseoperator on the basis of an index consideration. We point out an interestinganalogy between the phase operator problem and the chiral anomaly in gaugetheory, and an appearance of a new class of quantum anomaly is noted. Thenotion of index, which is invariant under a wide class of continuousdeformation, is also shown to be useful to characterize the representations ofQ-deformed oscillator algebra.
