We review and present new results for a string moving on an $SU(1,1)$ groupmanifold. We discuss two classes of theories which use discreterepresentations. For these theories the representations forbidden by unitaritydecouple and, in addition, one can construct modular invariant partitionfunctions. The partion functions do, however, contain divergencies due to thetime-like direction of the $SU(1,1)$ manifold. The two classes of theories havethe corresponding central charges $c=9,6,5,9/2,\ldots$ and$c=9,15,21,27,\ldots$. Subtracting two from the latter series of centralcharges we get the Gervais-Neveu series $c-2=7,13,19,25$. This suggests arelationship between the $SU(1,1)$ string and the Liouville theory, similar tothe one found in the $c=1$ string. Modular invariance is also demonstrated forthe principal continous representations. Furthermore, we present new resultsfor the Euclidean coset $SU(1,1)/U(1)$. The same two classes of theories willbe possible here and will have central charges $c=8,5,4,\dots$ and$c=8,14,20,26,\ldots$, where the latter class includes the critical 2d blackhole. The partition functions for the coset theory are convergent.(Talkpresented by S.H. at the 16'th Johns Hopkins' Workshop, G\"oteborg, Sweden,June 8-10, 1992)
