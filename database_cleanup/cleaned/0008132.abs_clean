We study QED on noncommutative spaces, NCQED. In particular we present thedetailed calculation for the noncommutative electron-photon vertex and showthat the Ward identity is satisfied. We discuss that in the noncommutative casemoving electron will show {\it electric} dipole effects. In addition, we workout the electric and magnetic dipole moments up to one loop level. For themagnetic moment we show that noncommutative electron has an intrinsic (spinindependent) magnetic moment.
