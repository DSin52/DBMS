Title: Duality and Scaling in Quantum Mechanics

Comments: 10 pages, Latex, email

Letters AThe nonadiabatic geometric phase in a time dependent quantum evolution isshown to provide an intrinsic concept of time having dual properties relativeto the external time. A nontrivial extension of the ordinary quantum mechanicsis thus obtained with interesting scaling laws. A fractal like structure intime is thus revealed.
