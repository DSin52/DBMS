(no changes in content -- AMS fonts are replaced by more universal bold fontsand some lines causing problems with non-standard tex versions are fixed.)This thesis describes a new approach to conformal field theory. This approachcombines the method of coadjoint orbits with resolutions and chiral vertexoperators to give a construction of the correlation functions of conformalfield theories in terms of geometrically defined objects. Explicit formulae aregiven for representations of Virasoro and affine algebras in terms of a localgauge choice on the line bundle associated with geometric quantization of agiven coadjoint orbit; these formulae define a new set of explicit bosonicrealizations of these algebras. The coadjoint orbit realizations take the formof dual Verma modules, making it possible to avoid the technical difficultiesassociated with the two-sided resolutions which arise from Feigin-Fuchs andWakimoto realizations. Formulae are given for screening and intertwiningoperators on the coadjoint orbit representations. Chiral vertex operatorsbetween Virasoro modules are constructed, and related directly to Virasoroalgebra generators in certain cases. From the point of view taken in thisthesis, vertex operators have a geometric interpretation as differentialoperators taking sections of one line bundle to sections of another. Asuggestion is made that by connecting this description with recent workderiving field theory actions from coadjoint orbits, a deeper understanding ofthe geometry of conformal field theory might be achieved.
