We develop the boundary string field theory approach to tachyon condensationon the DDbar system. Particular attention is paid to the gauge fields, whichcombine with the tachyons in a natural way. We derive the RR-couplings of thesystem and express the result in terms of Quillen's superconnection. The resultis related to an index theorem, and is thus shown to be exact.
