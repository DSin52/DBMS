We discuss the large N limit of the (2,0) field theory in six dimensions. Wedo this by assuming the validity of Maldacena's conjecture of thecorrespondence between large N gauge theories and supergravity backgrounds,here $AdS_7\times S^4$. We review the spectrum of the supergravity theory andcompute the spectrum of primary operators of the conformal algebra of arbitraryspin.
