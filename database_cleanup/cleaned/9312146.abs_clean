In this paper alternative formulations of the conventional uncertaintyrelation are studied in the context of decoherent histories. The results aregiven in terms of Shannon information. A variety of methods are developed toevaluate the upper bound for the probability of two or more projectionhistories. The methods employed give improved limits for the maximal achievableprobability and an improved lower bound for the Shannon information.The results are then applied to a number of physically relevant situations.
