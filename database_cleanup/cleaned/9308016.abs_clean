The higher spin symmetry for both Dirac and Majorana massless free fermionicfield models are considered. An infinite Lie algebra which is a linearrealization of the higher spin extension of the cross products of the Virasoroand affine Kac-Moody algebras is obtained. The corresponding current algebra isclosed which is not the case of annalogous current algebra in the WZNW model.The gauging procedure for the higher spin symmetry is given also.
