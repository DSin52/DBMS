Vector $SO(3)$ gauged $O(4)$ sigma models on $\R_3$ are presented. Thetopological charge supplying the lower bound on the energy and rendering thesoliton stable coincides with the Baryon number of the Skyrmion. These solitonshave vanishing magnetic monopole flux. To exhibit the existence of suchsolitons, the equations of motion of one of these models is integratednumerically. The structure of the conserved Baryon current is brieflydiscussed.
