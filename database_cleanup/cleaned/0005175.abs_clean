We consider the quadratic divergence of the Yang-Mills theory when we use thehybrid regularization method consisting of the higher covariant derivativeterms and the Pauli-Villars fields. By the explicit calculation of thediagrams, we show that the higher derivative terms for the ghost fields arenecessary for the complete cancellation of the quadratic divergence.
