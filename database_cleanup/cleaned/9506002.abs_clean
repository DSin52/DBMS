We present the alternative topological twisting of N=4 Yang-Mills, in whichthe path integral is dominated not by instantons, but by flat connections ofthe COMPLEXIFIED gauge group. The theory is nontrivial on compact orientablefour-manifolds with nonpositive Euler number, which are necessarily not simplyconnected. On such manifolds, one finds a single topological invariant,analogous to the Casson invariant of three-manifolds.
