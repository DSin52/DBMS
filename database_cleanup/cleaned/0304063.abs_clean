SystemsWe study differential and integral relations for the quantum Jost solutionsassociated with an integrable derivative nonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS) model. Byusing commutation relations between such Jost solutions and the basic fieldoperators of DNLS model, we explicitly construct first few quantum conservedquantities of this system including its Hamiltonian. It turns out that thisquantum Hamiltonian has a new kind of coupling constant which is quitedifferent from the classical one. This modified coupling constant plays acrucial role in our comparison between the results of algebraic and coordinateBethe ansatz for the case of DNLS model. We also find out the range of modifiedcoupling constant for which the quantum $N$-soliton state of DNLS model has apositive binding energy.
