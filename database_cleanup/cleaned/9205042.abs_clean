A reorganized perturbation expansion with a propagator of soft infraredbehavior is used to study the critical behavior of the mass gap. The conditionof relativistic covariance fixes the form of the soft propagator. Finiteapproximants to the correlation critical exponent can be obtained in everyorder of the modified, soft perturbation expansion. Alternatively, a convergentseries of exponents in large orders of the soft perturbation expansion isprovided by the renormalization group in all spatial dimensions, $1\leqD\leq3$. The result of the $\epsilon$-expansion is recovered in the$D\rightarrow 3 $ limit.
