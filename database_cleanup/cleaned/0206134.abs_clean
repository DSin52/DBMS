The thermodynamic Bethe ansatz method is employed for the study of theintegrable critical $RSOS(q_{1}, q_{2};q)$ model. The high and low temperaturebehavior are investigated, and the central charge of the effective conformalfield theory is derived. The obtained central charge is expressed as the sum ofthe central charges of two generalized coset models.
