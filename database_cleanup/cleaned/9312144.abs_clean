We show that the multi-boson KP hierarchies possess a class of discretesymmetries linking them to the discrete Toda systems. These discrete symmetriesare generated by the similarity transformation of the corresponding Laxoperator. This establishes a canonical nature of the discrete transformations.The spectral equation, which defines both the lattice system and thecorresponding Lax operator, plays a key role in determining pertinent symmetrystructure. We also introduce a concept of the square-root lattice leading to afamily of new pseudo-differential operators with covariance under additionalB\"{a}cklund transformations.
