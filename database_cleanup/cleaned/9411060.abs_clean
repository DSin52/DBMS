A crucial requirement for the standard interpretation of Monte Carlosimulations of simplicial quantum gravity is the existence of an exponentialbound that makes the partition function well-defined. We present numerical datafavoring the existence of an exponential bound, and we argue that the morelimited data sets on which recently opposing claims were based are alsoconsistent with the existence of an exponential bound.
