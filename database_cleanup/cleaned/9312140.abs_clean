We obtain an R-matrix or matrix representation of the Artin braid groupacting in a canonical way on the vector space of every (super)-Lie algebra orbraided-Lie algebra. The same result applies for every (super)-Hopf algebra orbraided-Hopf algebra. We recover some known representations such as thoseassociated to racks. We also obtain new representations such as a non-trivialone on the ring $k[x]$ of polynomials in one variable, regarded as abraided-line. Representations of the extended Artin braid group for braids inthe complement of $S^1$ are also obtained by the same method.
