Considering our (3+1)-dimensional space-time as, in some way, discrete or lattice with a parameter $a=\lambda_P$, where $\lambda_P$ is the Planck length,we have investigated the additional contributions of lattice artifact monopolesto beta-functions of the renormalisation group equations for the running finestructure constants $\alpha_i(\mu)$ (i=1,2,3 correspond to the U(1), SU(2) andSU(3) gauge groups of the Standard Model) in the Family Replicated Gauge GroupModel (FRGGM) which is an extension of the Standard Model at high energies. Itwas shown that monopoles have $N_{fam}$ times smaller magnetic charge in FRGGMthan in SM ($N_{fam}$ is the number of families in FRGGM). We have estimated also the enlargement of a number of fermions in FRGGM leading to the suppressionof the asymptotic freedom in the non-Abelian theory. We have shown that, incontrast to the case of AntiGUT when the FRGGM undergoes the breakdown at$\mu=\mu_G\sim 10^{18}$ GeV, we have the possibility of unification if theFRGGM-breakdown occurs at $\mu_G\sim 10^{14}$ GeV. By numerical calculations weobtained an example of the unification of all gauge interactions (includinggravity) at the scale $\mu_{GUT}\approx 10^{18.4}$ GeV. We discussed thepossibility of $[SU(5)]^3$ or $[SO(10)]^3$ (SUSY or not SUSY) unifications.
