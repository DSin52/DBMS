We derive an analytic form for the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian in the limitwhere the component of the electric field parallel to the magnetic field issmall. We expand these analytic functions to all orders in the field strength($F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$) in the limits of weak and strong fields, and use thesefunctions to estimate the pair-production rate in arbitrarily strong electricfields and the photon-splitting rate in arbitrarily strong magnetic fields.
