The thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations that have been proposed to describemassive integrable deformations of the coset conformal field theories$g_k\times g_l/g_{k+l}$ are shown to result directly by applying the usualthermodynamic Bethe Ansatz arguments to the trigonometric $S$-matrices for thealgebras $g=a_{m-1}$.
