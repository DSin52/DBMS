We consider properties of the CKM phase in the heterotic orbifold models. Wefind that at the renormalizable level the CKM phase vanishes identically forthe prime orbifolds, whereas it can be non-zero for some non-prime orbifolds.In particular, we study in detail the Z_6-I orbifold which allows for anon-trivial CKM phase and analyze the modular properties of the correspondingJarlskog invariant. The CKM phase is shown to vanish if the moduli fields arestabilized at Im T_i=\pm 1/2.
