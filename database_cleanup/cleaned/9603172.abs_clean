We investigate the gauged NJL--model in curved spacetime using the RGformulation and the equivalency with the gauge Higgs--Yukawa model in amodified 1/N_c -expansion. The strong curvature induced chiral symmetrybreaking is found in the non-perturbative RG approach (presumably equivalent tothe ladder Schwinger--Dyson equations). Dynamically generated fermion mass isexplicitly calculated and inducing of Einstein gravity is briefly discussed.This approach shows the way to the non-perturbative study of the dynamicalsymmetry breaking at external fields.
