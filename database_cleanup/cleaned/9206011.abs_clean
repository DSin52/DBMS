We construct the Zamolodchikov's c-function for the Chiral Gross-Neveu Modelup to two loops. We show that the c-function interpolates between the two knowncritical points of the theory, it is stationary at them and it decreases withthe running coupling constant. In particular one can infer the non-existence ofadditional critical points in the region under investigation.
