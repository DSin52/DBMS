Relativity, ed. T.Piran, World Scientific 1999, part A, pp.280-282.A direct method for obtaining the differential conservation laws in the fieldtheory from the principle of stationary action is proposed. The method is basedon a variation of field functions through small local transformation of aspecial kind. The action of general theory of relativity are considered.
