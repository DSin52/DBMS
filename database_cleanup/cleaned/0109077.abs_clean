de Leyva, Colombia, July 2001; minor corrections, 3 references addedWe give an introductory survey to the use of Hopf algebras in severalproblems of noncommutative geometry. The main example, the Hopf algebra ofrooted trees, is a graded, connected Hopf algebra arising from a universalconstruction. We show its relation to the algebra of transverse differentialoperators introduced by Connes and Moscovici in order to compute a local indexformula in cyclic cohomology, and to the several Hopf algebras defined byConnes and Kreimer to simplify the combinatorics of perturbativerenormalization. We explain how characteristic classes for a Hopf modulealgebra can be obtained from the cyclic cohomology of the Hopf algebra whichacts on it. Finally, we discuss the theory of noncommutative sphericalmanifolds and show how they arise as homogeneous spaces of certain compactquantum groups.
