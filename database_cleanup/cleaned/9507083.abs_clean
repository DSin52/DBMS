We consider representations of meromorphic bosonic chiral conformal fieldtheories, and demonstrate that such a representation is completely specified bya state within the theory. The necessary and sufficient conditions upon thisstate are derived, and, because of their form, we show that we may extend therepresentation to a representation of a suitable larger conformal field theory.In particular, we apply this procedure to the lattice (FKS) conformal fieldtheories, and deduce that Dong's proof of the uniqueness of the twistedrepresentation for the reflection-twisted projection of the Leech latticeconformal field theory generalises to an arbitrary even (self-dual) lattice. Asa consequence, we see that the reflection-twisted lattice theories of Dolan etal are truly self-dual, extending the analogies with the theories of latticesand codes which were being pursued. Some comments are also made on the generalconcept of the definition of an orbifold of a conformal field theory inrelation to this point of view.
