S and U-duality dictate that graviton scattering amplitudes in IIBsuperstring theory be automorphic functions on the appropriate fundamentaldomain which describe the inequivalent vacua of (compactified) theories. Aconstrained functional form of graviton scattering is proposed using Eisensteingenus one superstring theory, c) the perturbative coupling dependence of thesuperstring, and d) with the unitarity structure of the massless modes. Theform has a perturbative truncation in the genus expansion at a given order inthe derivative expansion. Comparisons between graviton scattering S-matricesand effective actions for the first quantized superstring are made at thequantum level. Possible extended finiteness properties of maximally extendedquantum supergravity theories in different dimensions is implied by theperturbative truncation of the functional form of graviton scattering in IIBsuperstring theory.
