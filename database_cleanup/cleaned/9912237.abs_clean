The three-phase version of the hybrid chiral bag model, containing the phaseof asymptotic freedom, the hadronization phase as well as the intermediatephase of constituent quarks, is proposed. For this model the self-consistentsolution, which takes into account the fermion vacuum polarization effects, isfound in (1+1) D. Within this solution the total energy of the bag, includingthe one-loop contribution from the Dirac's sea, is studied as the function ofthe bag geometry under condition of nonvanishing boson condensate density inthe interior region. The existence and uniqueness of the ground state bagconfiguration, which minimizes the total energy and contains all the threephases, are shown.
