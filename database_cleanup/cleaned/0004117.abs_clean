We show that certain five dimensional, N=2 Yang-Mills/Einstein supergravitytheories admit the gauging of the full R-symmetry group, SU(2)_R, of theunderlying N=2 Poincare superalgebra. This generalizes the previously studiedAbelian gaugings of U(1)_R subgroup of SU(2)_R and completes the constructionof the most general vector and tensor field coupled five dimensional N=2supergravity theories with gauge interactions. The gauging of SU(2)_R turns outto be possible only in special cases, and leads to a new type of scalarpotential. For a large class of these theories the potential does not have anycritical points.
