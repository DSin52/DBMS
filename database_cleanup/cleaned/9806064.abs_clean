Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, ItalyThe Chern-Simons (CS) theory in three dimensions with a compact gauge group Gis studied. Starting from the BRST quantization of the theory defined in R^3,the values of gauge invariants observables are computed in any closed andorientable three manifold M by constructing a surgery operator associated witha Dehn's surgery presentation of M. We have given the general rules to find thereduced tensor algebra whose elements give the physical inequivalent quantumnumbers that characterize uniquely the CS observables. Some general propertiesof the reduced tensor algebra and of the surgery operator are studied. Manyexamples of the general construction are given in the case of G=SU(2) andG=SU(3), in particular the expectation value of a Wilson line associated withthe unknot and the Hopf link in R^3(S^3) is computed for any irreduciblerepresentation of the gauge group. The relation of the topological invariantI(M), defined as a suitable modified partition function of the CS theory in M,and the fundamental group of M is studied. Finally, the relationship between CStheory and WZWN model in two dimensions is exploited to derive from a fullthree-dimensional point of view some classical results in conformal fieldtheory.
