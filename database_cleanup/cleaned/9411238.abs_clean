We study parity violation in $2+1$-dimensional gauge theories coupled tomassive fermions. Using the $\zeta$-function regularization approach weevaluate the ground state fermion current in an arbitrary gauge fieldbackground, showing that it gets two different contributions which violateparity invariance and induce a Chern-Simons term in the gauge-field effectiveaction. One is related to the well-known {\em classical} parity breakingproduced by a fermion mass term in 3 dimensions; the other one, already presentfor massless fermions, is related to peculiarities of gauge invariantregularization in odd-dimensional spaces.
