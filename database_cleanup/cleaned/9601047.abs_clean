We extend the discussion of projective group representations in quaternionicHilbert space which was given in our recent book. The associativity conditionfor quaternionic projective representations is formulated in terms of unitaryoperators and then analyzed in terms of their generator structure. Themulti--centrality and centrality assumptions are also analyzed in generatorterms, and implications of this analysis are discussed.
