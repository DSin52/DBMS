Title: An Analogue of Holstein-Primakoff and Dyson Realizations for Lie

Superalgebras. The Lie superalgebra sl(1/n)Authors: Tchavdar D. Palev

Comments: TeX, 6 pages

An analogue of the Holstein-Primakoff and of the Dyson realization for theLie superalgebra $sl(1/n)$ is written down. The expressions are formally thesame as for the Lie algebra $sl(n+1)$, however in the latter the Bose operatorshave to be replaced with Fermi operators.
