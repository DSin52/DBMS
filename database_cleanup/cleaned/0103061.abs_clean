We analyze the phemomenon of induced fermion number at finite temperature. Atfinite temperature, the induced fermion number $<N>$ is a thermal expectationvalue, and we compute the finite temperature fluctuations, $(\DeltaN)^2=<N^2>-<N>^2$. While the zero temperature induced fermion number istopological and is a sharp observable, the finite temperature induced fermionnumber is generically nontopological, and is not a sharp observable. Thefluctuations are due to the mixing of states inherent in any finite temperatureexpectation value. We analyze in detail two different cases in 1+1 dimensionalmodel background. At zero temperature the induced fermion numbers for these twocases are very similar, but at finite temperature they are very different. Thesigma model case is generic and the induced fermion number is nontopological,but the kink case is special and the fermion number is topological, even atfinite temperature. There is a simple physical interpretation of all theseresults in terms of the spectrum of the fermions in the relevant background,and many of the results generalize to higher dimensional models.
