We use brane configurations and SL(2,Z) symmetry of the type IIB string toconstruct mirror N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in three dimensions. Themirror map exchanges Higgs and Coulomb branches, Fayet-Iliopoulos and massparameters and U(1)R symmetries. Some quantities that are determined at thequantum level in one theory are determined at the classical level of themirror. One such example is the complex structure of the Coulomb branch of onetheory which is determined quantum mechanically. It is mapped to the complexstructure of the Higgs branch of the mirror theory, which is determinedclassically. We study the generation of N=2 superpotentials by open D-stringinstantons in the brane configurations.
