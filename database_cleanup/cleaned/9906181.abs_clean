We have analyzed the Unruh problem in the frame of quantum field theory andhave shown that the Unruh quantization scheme is valid in the double Rindlerwedge rather than in Minkowski spacetime. The double Rindler wedge is composedof two disjoint regions ($R$- and $L$-wedges of Minkowski spacetime) which arecausally separated from each other. Moreover the Unruh construction impliesexistence of boundary condition at the common edge of $R$- and $L$-wedges inMinkowski spacetime. Such boundary condition may be interpreted as atopological obstacle which gives rise to a superselection rule prohibiting anycorrelations between $r$- and $l$- Unruh particles. Thus the part of the fieldfrom the $L$-wedge in no way can influence a Rindler observer living in the$R$-wedge and therefore elimination of the invisible "left" degrees of freedomwill take no effect for him. Hence averaging over states of the field in onewedge can not lead to thermalization of the state in the other. This result isproved both in the standard and algebraic formulations of quantum field theoryand we conclude that principles of quantum field theory does not give anygrounds for existence of the "Unruh effect".
