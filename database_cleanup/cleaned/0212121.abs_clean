Title: Mean-field Approach to the Derivation of Baryon Superpotential from

Matrix ModelAuthors: Hisao Suzuki

Comments: rev2. ref. and related comments included, typos corrected

We discuss how to obtain the superpotential of the baryons and mesons forSU(N) gauge theories with N flavour matter fields from matrix integral. Weapply the mean-field approximation for the matrix integral. Assuming the planarlimit of the self-consistency equation, we show that the result almost agreeswith the field theoretical result.
