In the first part of this article, we find fractional D3-branes supergravitysolutions on orientifolded C^2/Z_2 orbifolds of type IIB string theory. Theone-loop corrected gauge couplings for the symplectic or orthogonal groupsliving on the D-branes are reproduced on the world-volume of probes. In thesecond part of the paper, we construct a D3-brane solution on the two-centersTaub-NUT manifold which interpolates between fractional D3-branes in the ALEspace limit and a T-dual smeared type IIA configuration. Then, we lift thisconfiguration to M-theory and comment on the connections with wrapped M5-branessolutions.
