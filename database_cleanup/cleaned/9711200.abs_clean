1113-1133We show that the large $N$ limit of certain conformal field theories invarious dimensions include in their Hilbert space a sector describingsupergravity on the product of Anti-deSitter spacetimes, spheres and othercompact manifolds. This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/stringtheory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the branedecouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust thenear horizon geometry for large $N$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the nearhorizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present inthe superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 'tHooft limit of 4-d ${\cal N} =4$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point iscompactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter spacetimes aredual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for adefinition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compactdimensions.
