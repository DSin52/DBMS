Anthropic solutions to the cosmological constant problem require seeminglyunnatural scalar field potentials with a very small slope or domain walls(branes) with a very small coupling to a four-form field. Here we introduce aclass of models in which the smallness of the corresponding parameters can beattributed to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. We also demonstrate theequivalence of scalar field and four-form models. Finally, we show how ourmodels can be naturally embedded into a left-right extension of the standardmodel.
