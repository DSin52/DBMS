Using the Gaussian wave-functional approach with the normal-orderingrenormalization prescription, we show that for the (3+1)-dimensional massivelambda phi^4 theory, ``precarious'' and ``autonomous'' phi^4s can exist if andonly if the normal-ordering mass is equal to the classical masses at thesymmetrc and asymmetric vacua, respectively.
