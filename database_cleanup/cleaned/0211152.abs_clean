In the AdS/CFT correspondence, wrapped D3-branes (such as "giant gravitons")on the string theory side of the correspondence have been identified withPfaffian, determinant and subdeterminant operators on the field theory side. Wesubstantiate this identification by showing that the presence of pairs of suchoperators in a correlation function of a large N gauge theory naturally leadsto a modified 't Hooft expansion including also worldsheets with boundaries.This happens independently of supersymmetry or conformal invariance.
