We review some recent results concerning the quantitative analysis of theuniversality classes of two-dimensional statistical models near their criticalpoint. We also discuss the exact calculation of the two--point correlationfunctions of disorder operators in a free theory of complex bosonic andfermionic field, correlators ruled by a Painleve differential equation.
