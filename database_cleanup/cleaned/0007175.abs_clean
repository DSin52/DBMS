K-theory provides a framework for classifying Ramond-Ramond (RR) charges andfields. K-theory of manifolds has a natural extension to K-theory ofnoncommutative algebras, such as the algebra considered in noncommutativeYang-Mills theory or in open string field theory. In a number of concreteproblems, the K-theory analysis proceeds most naturally if one starts out withan infinite set of D-branes, reduced by tachyon condensation to a finite set.This suggests that string field theory should be reconsidered for N=infinity.
