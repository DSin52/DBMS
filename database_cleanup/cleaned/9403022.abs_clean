The Thirring model with imaginary mass (or the sine-Gordon model withimaginary coupling) is deeply related to all the flows between minimalconformal theories. We solve this model explicitely using the Bethe ansatz. Wefind that there are Left and Right moving massless excitations with non trivialLR scattering. We compute the S matrix and recover the result conjectured byFendley et al.
