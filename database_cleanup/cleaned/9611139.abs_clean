Authors: J. Gegenberg

Comments: 5 pages, latex

A three dimensional supergravity theory which generalizes the super IG theoryof Witten and resembles the model discussed recently by Mann and Papadopoulosis displayed. The partition function is computed, and is shown to be athree-manifold invariant generalizing the Casson invariant.
