W(infinity)-type and Quantized Simplectic DiffeomorphismsAuthors: Manuel Calixto

Comments: LaTeX, 23 pages, no figures

This article is a further contribution to our research [M.CalixtoJ.Phys.A33(2000)L69] into a class of infinite-dimensional Lie algebrasL_\infty(m,n)generalizing the standard W_\infty algebra, viewed as a tensoroperator algebra of SU(1,1) in a group-theoretic framework. Here we interpretL_\infty(m,n)either as infinite continuations of pseudo-unitary symmetries oras "higher-U(m,n)-spin extensions" of the diffeomorphism algebra diff(m,n). Wealso provide a deeper mathematical interconnection between Poisson (andsymplectic diffeomorphism) algebras of functions on coadjoint orbits ofpseudo-unitary groups U(m,n) and the classical limit of the correspondingtensor operator (and group) algebras. As potential applications we comment onthe formulation of integrable higher-dimensional dynamical (field) systems andgauge theories of higher-extended objects. Some remarks on non-commutativegeometry are also made.
