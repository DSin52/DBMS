We give an integrable extension of the lattice models recently considered byI.Kostov in his study of strings in discrete space. These models are IRF modelswith spin variables living in any connected graph, the vertex model underlyingthese models is the Izergin-Korepin model. When the graph is taken to be asimply laced Dynkin diagram, it is conjectured that these models possesscritical regimes which are the dilute phase of SOS models of ADE type.
