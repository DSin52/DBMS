The existence of an electromagnetic field with parallel electric and magneticfield components in the presence of a gravitational field is considered. Anon-parallel solution is shown to exist. Next, we analyse the possibility offinding stationary gravitational waves in nature. Finally, we construct a D=4effective quantum gravity model. Tree-level unitarity is verified.
