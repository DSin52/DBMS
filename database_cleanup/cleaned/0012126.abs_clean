We present a model for the Dirac magnetic monopole, suitable for the strongcoupling regime. The magnetic monopole is static, has charge g and mass M,occupying a volume of radius R ~ O (g^2/M). It is shown that inside eachn-monopole there exist infinite multipoles. It is given an analytical proof ofthe existence of monopole-antimonopole bound state. Theses bound-states mightgive additional strong light to light scattering in the proton-antiprotoncollision process at FermiLab TEVATRON.
