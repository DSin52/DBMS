We discuss BPS states preserving 1/4 supersymmetries of N=4 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory as M2-branes holomorphically embedded and ending onM5-branes. We use techniques in electrodynamics to find the M2-braneconfigurations, and give some explicit examples. In case the M2-braneworldsheet has handles, the worldsheet moduli of the M2-brane is constrained ina discrete manner. Several aspects of multi-pronged strings in type IIB stringtheory are beautifully reproduced in the M-theory description. We also discussthe relation between the above construction and the D2-brane dynamics in typeIIA string theory.
