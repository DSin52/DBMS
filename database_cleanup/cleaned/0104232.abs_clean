Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we study UV behavior of Wilson loops invarious noncommutative gauge theories. We get an area law in most cases and tryto identify its origin. In D3 case, we may identify the the origin as the D1the flux of the D3 charge is highly suppressed, while the flux due to the D1charge is enhenced. So near the boundary the theory is more like a theory on D1brane than that on D3 brane. This phenomena is closely related to thedimensional reduction due to the strong magnetic field in the charged particlein the magnetic field. The linear potential is not due to the confinement by IReffect but is the analogue of Coulomb's potential in 1+1 dimension.
