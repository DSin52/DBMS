Comments: latex, 52 pages, one eps figure

In these notes we review the role played by the quantum mechanics and sigmamodels of symmetric product spaces in the light-cone quantization of quantumfield theories, string theory and matrix theory. Lectures given at theInstitute for Theoretical Physics, UC Santa Barbara, January 1998 and theSpring School on String Theory and Mathematics, Harvard University, May 1998.
