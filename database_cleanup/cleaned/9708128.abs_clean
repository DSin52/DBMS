Field Theory and Gravity (July-August 1997)Recent progress in quantum field theory and quantum gravity relies on mixedboundary conditions involving both normal and tangential derivatives of thequantized field. In particular, the occurrence of tangential derivatives in theboundary operator makes it possible to build a large number of new localinvariants. The integration of linear combinations of such invariants of theorthogonal group yields the boundary contribution to the asymptotic expansionof the integrated heat-kernel. This can be used, in turn, to study the one-loopsemiclassical approximation. The coefficients of linear combination are nowbeing computed for the first time. They are universal functions, in that arefunctions of position on the boundary not affected by conformal rescalings ofthe background metric, invariant in form and independent of the dimension ofthe background Riemannian manifold. In Euclidean quantum gravity, the problemarises of studying infinitely many universal functions.
