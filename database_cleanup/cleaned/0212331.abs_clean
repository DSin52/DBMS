Comments: 6 pages

We discuss the effective theory for the close limit of two branes in acovariant way. To do so we solve the five dimensional Einstein equation alongthe direction of extra dimension. Using the Taylor expansion we formally solvethe bulk and derive the effective theory describing the close limit systems. Wewill also discuss the radion dynamics and braneworld black holes for the closelimit in our formulation.
