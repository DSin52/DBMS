We construct the non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds interpreted as the complexline bundles over the Hermitian symmetric spaces. These manifolds are thevarious generalizations of the complex line bundle over CP^{N-1}. Imposing anF-term constraint on the line bundle over CP^{N-1}, we obtain the line bundleover the complex quadric surface Q^{N-2}. On the other hand, when we promotethe U(1) gauge symmetry in CP^{N-1} to the non-abelian gauge group U(M), theline bundle over the Grassmann manifold is obtained. We construct thenon-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds with isometries of exceptional groups, whichwe have not discussed in the previous papers. Each of these manifolds containsthe resolution parameter which controls the size of the base manifold, and theconical singularity appears when the parameter vanishes.
