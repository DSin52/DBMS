A multimonopole solution in Yang-Mills field theory is obtained by amodification of the 't Hooft ansatz for a four-dimensional instanton. Althoughthis solution has divergent action near each source, it can be used toconstruct an exact finite action multimonopole solution of heterotic stringtheory, in which the divergences from the Yang-Mills sector are preciselycancelled by those from the gravity sector.
