Theories in more than ten dimensions play an important role in understandingnonperturbative aspects of string theory. Consistent compactifications of suchtheories can be constructed via Calabi-Yau fourfolds. These models can beanalyzed particularly efficiently in the Landau-Ginzburg phase of the linearsigma model, when available. In the present paper we focus on those sigmamodels which have both a Landau-Ginzburg phase and a geometric phase describedby hypersurfaces in weighted projective five-space. We describe some of thepertinent properties of these models, such as the cohomology, the connectivityof the resulting moduli space, and mirror symmetry among the 1,100,055configurations which we have constructed.
