We consider the spectrum of BPS saturated states in $N = 2$ gauge theories infour dimensions. This spectrum may be discontinuous across real codimension onesubmanifolds of marginal stability in the moduli space of vacua. An example,which can be treated with semiclassical methods in the weak coupling limit, isthe decay of quark-soliton bound states. For a quark and a soliton ofelectric-magnetic charge vectors $Q$ and $Q^\prime$ respectively, we find thatas the manifold of marginal stability is crossed, the number of soliton stateschanges by a factor of $2^{Q \cdot Q^\prime}$, where the dot denotes thesymplectic product.
