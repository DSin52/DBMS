We bosonize the Massive Thirring Model in 3+1D for small coupling constantand arbitrary mass. The bosonized action is explicitly obtained both in termsof a Kalb-Ramond tensor field as well as in terms of a dual vector field. Anexact bosonization formula for the current is derived. The small and large masslimits of the bosonized theory are examined in both the direct and dual forms.We finally obtain the exact bosonization of the free fermion with an arbitrarymass.
