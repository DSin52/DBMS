New approach to exact solvability of dilaton gravity theories is suggestedwhich appeals directly to structure of field equations. It is shown that blackholes regular at the horizon are static and their metric is found explicitly.If a metric possesses singularities the whole spacetime can be divided intodifferent sheets with one horizon on each sheet between neighboringsingularities with a finite value of dilaton field (addition horizons may ariseat infinite value of it), neighboring sheets being glued along the singularity.The position of singularities coincide with the values of dilaton in solutionswith a constant dilaton field. Quantum corrections to the Hawking temperaturevanish. For a wide subset of these models the relationship between the totalenergy and the total entropy of the quantum finite size system is the same asin the classical limit. For another subset the metric itself does not acquirequantum corrections. The present paper generalizes Solodukhin's results on theRST model in that instead of a particular model we deal with whole classes ofthem. Apart from this, the found models exhibit some qualitatively newproperties which are absent in the RST model. The most important one is thatthere exist quantum black holes with geometry regular everywhere includinginfinity.
