Title: Group actions and deformations for harmonic maps

Comments: 36 pages

We obtain some new results on classical solutions of two dimensionalEuclidean sigma models. From earlier work of Din-Zakrzewski, Glaser-Stora, andnumerous differential geometers, one knows explicit solutions in the case ofthe $S^n$-model, the $CP^n$-model, and the $U(n)$-model. However, very littleis known about the "moduli space" of solutions itself. In this paper we studythe connected components of these spaces. In a subsequent paper (with M. Furutaand M. Kotani), we compute the fundamental group, in the case of the$S^n$-model.
