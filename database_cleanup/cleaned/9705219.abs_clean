We propose to parametrize the configuration space of one-dimensional quantumsystems of N identical particles by the elementary symmetric polynomials ofbosonic and fermionic coordinates. It is shown that in this parametrization theHamiltonians of the A_N, BC_N, B_N, C_N and D_N Calogero and Sutherland models,as well as their supersymmetric generalizations, can be expressed -- forarbitrary values of the coupling constants -- as quadratic polynomials in thegenerators of a Borel subalgebra of the Lie algebra gl(N+1) or the Liesuperalgebra gl(N+1|N) for the supersymmetric case. These algebras are realizedby first order differential operators. This fact establishes the exactsolvability of the models according to the general definition given by one ofthe authors in 1994, and implies that the Calogero and Jack-Sutherlandpolynomials, as well as their supersymmetric generalizations, are related tofinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the Lie algebra gl(N+1) andthe Lie superalgebra gl(N+1|N).
