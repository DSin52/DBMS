We consider the master Lagrangian of Deser and Jackiw, interpolating betweenthe self-dual and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons Lagrangian, and quantize itfollowing the symplectic approach, as well as the traditional Dirac scheme. Wedemonstrate the equivalence of these procedures in the subspace of thesecond-class constraints. We then proceed to embed this mixed first- andsecond-class system into an extended first-class system within the framework ofboth approaches, and construct the corresponding generator for this extendedgauge symmetry in both formulations.
