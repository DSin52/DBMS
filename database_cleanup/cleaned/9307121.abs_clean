Title: Does String Theory Have a Duality Symmetry Relating Weak and Strong

Coupling?Comments: (presented at Strings '93), 14 pages, phyzzx

The heterotic string theory, compactified to four dimensions, has beenconjectured to have a duality symmetry (S duality) that transforms the dilatonnonlinearly. If valid, this symmetry could provide an important means ofobtaining information about nonperturbative features of the theory. Even thoughit is inherently nonperturbative, S duality exhibits many similarities with thewell-established target-space duality symmetry (T duality), which does actperturbatively. These similarities are manifest in a new version of thelow-energy effective field theory and in the soliton spectrum obtained bysaturating the Bogomol'nyi bound. Curiously, there is evidence that the rolesof the S and T dualities are interchanged in passing to a five-braneformulation.
