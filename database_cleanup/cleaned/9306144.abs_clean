Authors: Shogo Tanimura

Comments: 34 pages

A definition of quantum mechanics on a manifold $ M $ is proposed and amethod to realize the definition is presented. This scheme is applicable to ahomogeneous space $ M = G / H $. The realization is a unitary representation ofthe transformation group $ G $ on the space of vector bundle-valued functions.When $ H \ne \{ e \} $, there exist a number of inequivalent realizations. Asexamples, quantum mechanics on a sphere $ S^n $, a torus $ T^n $ and aprojective space $ \RP $ are studied. In any case, it is shown that there arean infinite number of inequivalent realizations.
