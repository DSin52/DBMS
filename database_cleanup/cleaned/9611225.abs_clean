The integral representations of the $\hat {sl}(2,C)$ Spin 1/2 - Spin 1/2Kac-Moody Blocks on the torus, arising from the free field representation ofthe $\hat {sl}(2,C)$ Kac-Moody algebra of Wakimoto and Bernard and Felder, areused to derive an infinite class of representations of the mapping class groupof the two punctured torus.
