Title: Mass Gap and Confinement in (2+1)-Dimensional Yang-Mills Theory

Comments: 4 pages, Latex, minor corrections. Talk at the ``5th International

Workshop of Thermal Field Theories and Their Applications", Regensburg,Germany, August 1998Using a gauge-invariant matrix parametrization of the gauge fields, wepresent an analysis of how the mass gap arises in (2+1)-dimensional Yang-Millstheory. We further derive an analytical continuum expression for the vacuumwavefunction and based on this we calculate the string tension which is inexcellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of the corresponding latticegauge theory.
