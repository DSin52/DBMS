Title: Soft Supersymmetry-breaking terms and the \mu problem

Comments: Based on talks given at different Conferences, 33 pages, latex

The connection between Supergravity and the low-energy world is analyzed. Inparticular, the soft Supersymmetry-breaking terms arising in Supergravity, the$\mu$ problem and various solutions proposed to solve it are reviewed. The softterms arising in Supergravity theories coming from Superstring theory are alsocomputed and the solutions proposed to solve the $\mu$ problem, which arenaturally present in Superstrings, are also discussed. The $B$ soft termsassociated are given for the different solutions. Finally, the low-energySupersymmetric-spectra, which are very characteristic, are obtained.
