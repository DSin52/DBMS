The gravitating matter is studied within the framework of the non-commutativegeometry. The non-commutative Einstein-Hilbert action on the product of a fourdimensional manifold with a discrete space gives the models of matter fieldscoupled to the standard Einstein gravity.The matter multiplet is encoded in theDirac operator which yields the representation of the algebra of the universalforms. The general form of the Dirac operator depends on a choice of thegrading of the corresponding spinor bundle. A choice is given, which leads tothe nonlinear vector sigma-model coupled to the Einstein gravity.
