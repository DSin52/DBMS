Static axisymmetric Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton and stationary axisymmetricEinstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) theories in four space-time dimensionsare shown to be integrable by means of the inverse scattering transform method.The proof is based on the coset-space representation of the 4-dim theory in aspace-time admitting a Killing vector field. Hidden symmetry group of thefour-dimensional EMDA theory, unifying T and S string dualities, is shown to beSp(2, R) acting transitively on the coset Sp(2, R)/U(2). In the case oftwo-parameter Abelian space-time isometry group, the hidden symmetry is thecorresponding infinite-dimensional group of the Geroch-Kinnersley-Chitre type.
