We construct smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds Z, torus-fibered over a dP_9 base,with fundamental group Z_2 X Z_2. To do this, the structure of rationalelliptic surfaces is studied and it is shown that a restricted subset of suchsurfaces admit at least a Z_2 X Z_2 group of automorphisms. One then constructsCalabi-Yau threefolds X as the fiber product of two such dP_9 surfaces,demonstrating that the involutions on the surfaces lift to a freely acting Z_2X Z_2 group of automorphisms on X. The threefolds Z are then obtained as thequotient Z=X/(Z_2 X Z_2). These Calabi-Yau spaces Z admit stable, holomorphicSU(4) vector bundles which, in conjunction with Z_2 X Z_2 Wilson lines, lead tostandard-like models of particle physics with naturally suppressed nucleondecay.
