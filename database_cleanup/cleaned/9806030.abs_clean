We propose some analogue of the Narain lattice for CHL string. The symmetriesof this lattice are the symmetries of the perturbative spectrum. We explain inthis language the known results about the possible gauge groups in compactifiedtheory. For the four-dimensional theory, we explicitly describe the action ofS-duality on the background fields. We show that the moduli spaces of the six,seven and eight-dimensional compactifications coincide with the moduli spacesof the conjectured Type IIA, M Theory and F Theory duals. We classify therational components of the boundary of the moduli space in seven, eight andnine dimensions.
