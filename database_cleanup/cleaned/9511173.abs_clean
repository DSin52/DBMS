We construct the open string boundary states corresponding to varioustime-dependent deformations of the D-brane and explore several ways in whichthey may be used to study stringy soliton collective coordinate quantumdynamics. Among other things, we find that D-strings have exact modulicorresponding to arbitrary chiral excitations of the basic soliton. These arepresumably the duals of the BPS-saturated excitations of the fundamental TypeIIB string. These first steps in a systematic study of the dynamics andinteractions of Dirichlet-brane solitons give further evidence of theconsistency of Polchinski's new approach to string soliton physics.
