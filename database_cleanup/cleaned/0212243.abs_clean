Title: Quantum Liouville theory versus quantized Teichm\"uller spaces

Authors: J. Teschner

Comments: Contribution to the proceedings of the 35th Ahrenshoop Symposium

This note announces the proof of a conjecture of H. Verlinde, according towhich the spaces of Liouville conformal blocks and the Hilbert spaces from thequantization of the Teichm\"uller spaces of Riemann surfaces carry equivalentrepresentations of the mapping class group. This provides a basis for thegeometrical interpretation of quantum Liouville theory in its relation toquantized spaces of Riemann surfaces.
