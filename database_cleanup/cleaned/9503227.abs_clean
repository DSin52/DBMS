We study the ground state energy of integrable $1+1$ quantum field theorieswith boundaries (the genuine Casimir effect). In the scalar case, this is doneby introducing a new, ``R-channel TBA'', where the boundary is represented by aboundary state, and the thermodynamics involves evaluating scalar products ofboundary states with all the states of the theory. In the non-scalar,sine-Gordon case, this is done by generalizing the method of Destri and DeVega. The two approaches are compared. Miscellaneous other results areobtained, in particular formulas for the overall normalization and scalarproducts of boundary states, exact partition functions for the critical Isingmodel in a boundary magnetic field, and also results for the energy, excitedstates and boundary S-matrix of $O(n)$ and minimal models.
