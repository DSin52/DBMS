We consider a Dirac field in 2+1 Euclidean dimensions, in the presence of alinear domain wall defect in its mass, and a constant electromagnetic field. Weevaluate the exact fermionic determinant for the situation where the defect isassumed to be rectilinear, static, and the gauge field is minimally coupled tothe fermions. We discuss the dependence of the result on the (unique)independent geometrical parameter of this system, namely, the relativeorientation of the wall and the direction of the external field. We apply theresult for the determinant to the evaluation of the vacuum energy.
