Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics, (Goslar, Germany, July1996)We summarize recent progress in the understanding of fixed point resolutionfor conformal field theories. Fixed points in both coset conformal fieldtheories and non-diagonal modular invariants which describe simple currentextensions of chiral algebras are investigated. A crucial role is played by themathematical structures of twining characters and orbit Lie algebras.
