We derive the current algebra of principal chiral models with a Wess-Zuminoterm. At the critical coupling where the model becomes conformally invariant(Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten theory), this algebra reduces to two commutingKac-Moody algebras, while in the limit where the coupling constant is taken tozero (ordinary chiral model), we recover the current algebra of that model. Inthis way, the latter is explicitly realized as a deformation of the former,with the coupling constant as the deformation parameter.
