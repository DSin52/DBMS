We study a bosonic string with one end free and the other confined to aD-brane. Only the odd oscillator modes are allowed, which leads to a Virasoroalgebra of even Virasoro modes only. The theory is quantized in a gauge whereworld-sheet time and ordinary time are identified. There are no negative ornull norm states, and no tachyon. The Regge slope is twice that of the openstring; this can serve as a test of the usefulness of the the model as asemi-quantitative description of mesons with one light and one extremely heavyquark when such higher spin mesons are found. The Virasoro conditions selectspecific SO(D-1) irreps. The asymptotic density of states can be estimated byadapting the Hardy-Ramanujan analysis to a partition of odd integers; theestimate becomes exact as D goes to infinity.
