The equivalence between the Chern-Simons gauge theory on a three-dimensionalmanifold with boundary and the WZNW model on the boundary is established in asimple and general way using the BRST symmetry. Our approach is based onrestoring gauge invariance of the Chern-Simons theory in the presence of aboundary. This gives a correspondence to the WZNW model that does not requiresolving any constraints, fixing the gauge or specifying boundary conditions.
