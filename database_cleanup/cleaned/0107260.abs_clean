In this paper we consider superstring propagation in a nontrivial NS-NSbackground. We deform the world sheet stress tensor and supercurrent with aninfinitesimal B_{\mu\nu} field. We construct the gauge-covariant super-Poincaregenerators in this background and show that the B_{\mu\nu} field spontaneouslybreaks spacetime supersymmetry. We find that the gauge-covariant spacetimemomenta cease to commute with each other and with the spacetime supercharges.We construct a set of "magnetic" super-Poincare generators that are conservedfor constant field strength H_{\mu\nu\lambda}, and show that these generatorsobey a "magnetic" extension of the ordinary supersymmetry algebra.
