Title: Pregeometrical Formulation of Berkovits' Open RNS Superstring Field

TheoriesAuthors: Makoto Sakaguchi

Comments: 1+15 pages

We propose a pregeometrical formulation of Berkovits' openRamond-Neveu-Schwarz (RNS) superstring field theories. We show that Berkovits'open RNS superstring field theories arise by expanding around particularsolutions of the classical equations of motion for this theory. Our actioncontains pure ghost operators only and so is formally background independent.
