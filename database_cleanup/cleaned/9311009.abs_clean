We prove local background independence of the complete quantum closed stringfield theory using the recursion relations for string vertices and theexistence of connections in CFT theory space. Indeed, with this data weconstruct an antibracket preserving map between the state spaces of two nearbyconformal theories taking the corresponding string field measures $d\mue^{2S/\hbar}$ into each other. A geometrical construction of the map isachieved by introducing a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra on spaces of Riemannsurfaces, together with a map to the BV algebra of string functionals. Theconditions of background independence show that the field independent terms ofthe master action arise from vacuum vertices $\V_{g,0}$, and that the overall$\hbar$-independent normalization of the string field measure involves thetheory space connection. Our result puts on firm ground the widely believedstatement that string theories built from nearby conformal theories aredifferent states of the same theory.
