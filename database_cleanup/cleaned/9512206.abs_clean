Quantization of free string field theory in the Rindler space-time is studiedby using the covariant formulation and taking the center-of-mass value of theRindler string time-coordinate $\eta(\sigma)$ as the time variable forquantization. We construct the string Rindler modes which vanish in either ofthe Rindler wedges $\pm$ defined by the Minkowski center-of-mass coordinate ofthe string. We then evaluate the Bogoliubov coefficients between the Rindlerstring creation/annihilation operators and the Minkowski ones, and analyze thestring thermalization. An approach to the construction of the string Rindlermodes corresponding to different definitions of the wedges is also presentedtoward a thorough understanding of the structure of the Hilbert space of thestring field theory on the Rindler space-time.
