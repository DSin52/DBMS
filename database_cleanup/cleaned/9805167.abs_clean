The four-form field recently considered by Hawking and Turok couplesnaturally to a charged membrane, across which the effective cosmologicalconstant has a discontinuity. We present instantons for the creation of an openinflationary universe surrounded by a membrane. They can also be used todescribe the nucleation of a membrane on a pre-existing inflationarybackground. This process typically decreases the value of the effectivecosmological constant and may lead to a novel scenario of eternal inflation.Moreover, by coupling the inflaton field to the membrane, the troublesomesingularities which arise in the Hawking-Turok model can be eliminated.
