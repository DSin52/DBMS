A quantizable action has recently been proposed for the superstring in anAdS_5 x S^5 background with Ramond-Ramond flux. In this paper, we constructphysical vertex operators corresponding to on-shell fluctuations around theAdS_5 x S^5 background. The structure of these AdS_5 x S^5 vertex operatorsclosely resembles the structure of the massless vertex operators in a flatbackground.
