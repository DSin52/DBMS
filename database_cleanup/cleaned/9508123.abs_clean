We consider a relativistic strongly interacting Bose gas. The interaction ismanifested in the off-shellness of the equilibrium distribution. The equationof state that we obtain for such a gas has the properties of a realisticequation of state of strongly interacting matter, i.e., at low temperature itagrees with the one suggested by Shuryak for hadronic matter, while at hightemperature it represents the equation of state of an ideal ultrarelativisticStefan-Boltzmann gas, implying a phase transition to an effectively weaklyinteracting phase.
