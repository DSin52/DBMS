We demonstrate that an impulse action (`recoil') on a D-particle embedded ina (four-dimensional) cosmological Robertson-Walker (RW) spacetime is described,in a $\sigma$-model framework, by a suitably extended higher-order logarithmicworld-sheet algebra of relevant deformations. We study in some detail thealgebra of the appropriate two-point correlators, and give a careful discussionas to how one can approach the world-sheet renormalization group infrared fixedpoint, in the neighborhood of which the logarithmic algebra is valid. It isfound that, if the initial RW spacetime does not have cosmological horizons,then there is no problem in approaching the fixed point. However, in thepresence of horizons, there are world-sheet divergences which imply the needfor Liouville dressing in order to approach the fixed point in the correct way.A detailed analysis on the subtle subtraction of these divergences in thelatter case is given. In both cases, at the fixed point, the recoil-inducedspacetime is nothing other than a coordinate transformation of the initialspacetime into the rest frame of the recoiling D-particle. However, in thehorizon case, if one identifies the Liouville mode with the target time, whichexpresses physically the back reaction of the recoiling D-particle onto thespacetime structure, it is found that the induced spacetime distortion resultsin the removal of the initial cosmological horizon and the eventual stopping ofthe acceleration of the Universe. In this latter sense, our model may bethought of as a conformal field theory description of a (toy) Universecharacterized by a sort of `phase transition' at the moment of impulse,implying a time-varying speed of light.
