We derive a general expression for the power spectra of scalar and tensorfluctuations generated during inflation given an arbitrary choice of boundarycondition for the mode function at a short distance. We assume that theboundary condition is specified at a short-distance cutoff at a scale $M$ whichis independent of time. Using a particular prescription for the boundarycondition at momentum $p = M$, we find that the modulation to the power spectraof density and gravitational wave fluctuations is of order $(H/M)$, where $H$is the Hubble parameter during inflation, and we argue that this behavior isgeneric, although by no means inevitable. With fixed boundary condition, wefind that the shape of the modulation to the power spectra is determinedentirely by the deviation of the background spacetime from the de Sitter limit.
