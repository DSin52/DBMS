We consider type IIB string theory on a seven dimensional orbifold withholonomy in G2. The motivation is to use D1-branes as probes of the geometry.The low energy theory on the D1-brane is a sigma-model with two realsupercharges (N = (1,1) in two dimensional language). We study in detail theclosed and open string sectors and propose a coupling of the twisted fields tothe brane that modifies the vacuum moduli space so that the singularity at theorigin is removed. Instead of coming from D-terms, which are not present here,the modification comes from a ``twisted'' mass term for the seven scalarmultiplets on the brane. The proposed mechanism involves a generalization ofthe moment map.
