Relations between the global structure of the gauge group in ellipticF-theory compactifications, fractional null string junctions, and theMordell-Weil lattice of rational sections are discussed. We extend results inthe literature, which pertain primarily to rational elliptic surfaces andobtain pi^1(G) where G is the semi-simple part of the gauge group. We show howto obtain the full global structure of the gauge group, including all U(1)factors. Our methods are not restricted to rational elliptic surfaces. We alsoconsider elliptic K3's and K3-fibered Calabi-Yau three-folds.
