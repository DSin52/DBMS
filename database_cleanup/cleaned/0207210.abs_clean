A field model of two-component fermions is described, the consequences ofwhich coincide in the main with primary postulates of the standard model. Sucha model can be constructed for 4 generations at the minimum. Peculiarities ofthe relative coordinate space, determining in general an internal symmetrygroup, are considered. Analogues of the Higgs fields appear in the modelnaturally after transition to the Grassmannian extra coordinates.
