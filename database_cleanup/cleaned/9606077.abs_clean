We describe an infinite-dimensional algebra of hidden symmetries for theself-dual gravity equations. Besides the known diffeomorphism-type symmetries(affine extension of w(infinity) algebra), this algebra contains new hiddensymmetries, which are an affine extension of the Lorentz rotations. The fullsymmetry algebra has both Kac-Moody and Virasoro-like generators, whoseexponentiation maps solutions of the field equations to other solutions.Relations to problems of string theories are briefly discussed.
