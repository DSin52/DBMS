Title: Conformal invariant strings with extrinsic curvature action

Authors: G.Savvidy

Comments: 12 pages, LaTex, 1 figure, we demonstrated that the absence of

conformal anomaly requires the space-time to be 13-dimensionalWe study a string theory which is exclusively based on extrinsic curvatureaction. It is a tensionless string theory because the action reduces toperimeter for the flat Wilson loop. We are able to solve and quantize thishigh-derivative nonlinear two-dimensional conformal field theory. The absenceof conformal anomaly in quantum theory requires that the space-time should be13-dimensional. We have found that all particles, with arbitrary large spin,are massless. This pure massless spectrum is consistent with the tensionlesscharacter of the theory and we speculate that it may describe unbroken phase ofstandard string theory.
