A magnetic monopole is placed at the centre of a 3-ball whose surface, S, istiled by the symmetry group, G, of a regular solid. The quantum mechanics onthe two-dimensional quotient, S/G, is developed and the monopole charge isfound to be quantized in the expected manner. The heat-kernels andzeta-functions are evaluated and the Casimir energies computed as examples ofthe formalism. Numerical approaches to the calculation of the derivative of theBarnes zeta-function are presented.
