The geometric action of modular groups for wedge regions (Bisognano-Wichmannproperty) is derived from the principles of local quantum physics for a largeclass of Poincare covariant models in d=4. As a consequence, the CPT theoremholds for this class. The models must have a complete interpretation in termsof massive particles. The corresponding charges need not be localizable inspacelike cones.
