We propose a formulation of the massive spinning particle in terms ofphysical bosonic and fermionic fields only. We make use neither of auxiliaryobjects of the type of $\gamma_5$ nor of gauge fields. The model is to be usedas a suitable starting point for a forthcoming study of the rigidsuperparticle.
