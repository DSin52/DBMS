We find new solutions of IIA supergravity which have the interpretation ofintersecting NS-5-branes at $Sp(2)$-angles on a string preserving at least 3/32of supersymmetry. We show that the relative position of every pair ofNS-5-branes involved in the superposition is determined by four angles. Inaddition we explore the related configurations in IIB strings and M-theory.
