We discuss the classical limit for the long-distance (``soft'') modes of aquantum field when the hard modes of the field are in thermal equilibrium. Weaddress the question of the correct semiclassical dynamics when a momentumcut-off is introduced. Higher order contributions leads to a stochasticinterpretation for the effective action in analogy to Quantum Brownian Motion,resulting in dissipation and decoherence for the evolution of the soft modes.Particular emphasis is put on the understanding of dissipation. Our discussionfocuses mostly on scalar fields, but we make some remarks on the extension togauge theories.
