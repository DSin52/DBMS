We apply the modified triplectic formalism for quantizing several populargauge models - non-abelian antisymmetric tensor field model, W2-gravity andtwo-dimensional gravity with dynamical torsion. The explicit solutions areobtained for the generating equations of the quantum action and thegauge-fixing functional. Using these solutions we construct the vacuumfunctional and obtain the corresponding transformations of the extended BRSTsymmetry.
