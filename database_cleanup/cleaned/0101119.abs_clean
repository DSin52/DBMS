Supersymmetric solutions, such as BPS domain walls or black holes, in four-and five-dimensional supergravity theories with eight supercharges can bedescribed by effective quantum mechanics with a potential term. We show howproperties of the latter theory can help us to learn about the physics ofsupersymmetric vacua and BPS solutions in these supergravity theories. Thegeneral approach is illustrated in a number of specific examples where scalarfields of matter multiplets take values in symmetric coset spaces.
