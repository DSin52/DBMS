We discuss topologically massive QED --- the Abelian gauge theory in which(2+1)-dimensional QED with a Chern-Simons term is minimally coupled to a spinorfield. We quantize the theory in covariant gauges, and construct a class ofunitary transformations that enable us to embed the theory in a Fock space ofstates that implement Gauss's law. We show that when electron (and positron)creation and annihilation operators represent gauge-invariant charged particlesthat are surrounded by the electric and magnetic fields required by Gauss'slaw, the unitarity of the theory is manifest, and charged particles interactwith photons and with each other through nonlocal potentials. These potentialsinclude a Hopf-like interaction, and a planar analog of the Coulombinteraction. The gauge-invariant charged particle excitations that implementGauss's law obey the identical anticommutation rules as do the originalgauge-dependent ones. Rotational phases, commonly identified as planar `spin',are arbitrary, however.
