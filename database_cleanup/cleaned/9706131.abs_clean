Title: On the geometry of soft breaking terms and N=1 superpotentials

Authors: Cesar Gomez

Comments: Latex file. 8 pages

We describe, in the context of M-theory on elliptically fibered Calabi-yaufourfolds, the change of variables that allow us to pass from the U(1)invariant elliptic fibration to the one describing the uncompactified fourdimensional limit, where the U(1) symmetry is broken. These changes ofvariables are the analog to the ones used to derive from the Atiyah-Hitchinspace the complex structure of the Seiberg-Witten solution for N=2supersymmetric Yang-Mills. The connection between these changes of variablesand the recently introduced rotation of branes is discussed.
