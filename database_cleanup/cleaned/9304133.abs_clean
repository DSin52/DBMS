The field identification problem, including fixed point resolution, is solvedfor the non-hermitian symmetric $N=2$ superconformal coset theories. Therebythese models are finally identified as well-defined modular invariant CFTs. Asan application, the theories are used as subtheories in tensor products with$c=9$, which in turn are taken as the inner sector of heterotic superstringcompactifications. All string theories of this type are classified, and thechiral ring as well as the number of massless generations and anti-generationsare computed with the help of the extended Poincare polynomial. Severalequivalences between a priori different non-hermitian cosets show up; inparticular there is a level-rank duality for an infinite series based on $C$type Lie algebras. Further, some general results for generic $N=2$ cosets areand it is shown that the set of Ramond ground states of any $N=2$ coset modelis invariant under charge conjugation.
