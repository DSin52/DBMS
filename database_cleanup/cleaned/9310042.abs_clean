We present a comprehensive discussion of the consistency of the effectivequantum field theory of a single $Z_2$ symmetric scalar field. The theory isconstructed from a bare Euclidean action which at a scale much greater than theparticle's mass is constrained only by the most basic requirements; stability,finiteness, analyticity, naturalness, and global symmetry. We prove to allorders in perturbation theory the boundedness, convergence, and universality ofthe theory at low energy scales, and thus that the theory is perturbativelyrenormalizable in the sense that to a certain precision over a range of suchscales it depends only on a finite number of parameters. We then demonstratethat the effective theory has a well defined unitary and causal analyticS--matrix at all energy scales. We also show that redundant terms in theLagrangian may be systematically eliminated by field redefinitions withoutchanging the S--matrix, and discuss the extent to which effective field theoryand analytic S--matrix theory are actually equivalent. All this is achieved bya systematic exploitation of Wilson's exact renormalization group flowequation, as used by Polchinski in his original proof of the renormalizabilityof conventional $\varphi^4$-theory.
