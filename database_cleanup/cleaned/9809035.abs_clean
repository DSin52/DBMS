It has been proposed that spacetimes with a U(1) isometry group havecontributions to the entropy from Misner strings as well as from the area of$d-2$ dimensional fixed point sets. In this paper we test this proposal byconstructing Taub-Nut-AdS and Taub-Bolt-AdS solutions which are examples of anew class of asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spaces. We find that withthe additional contribution from the Misner strings, we exactly reproduce theentropy calculated from the action by the usual thermodynamic relations. Thisentropy has the right parameter dependence to agree with the entropy of aconformal field theory on the boundary, which is a squashed three-sphere, atleast in the limit of large squashing. However the conformal field theory andthe normalisation of the entropy remain to be determined.
