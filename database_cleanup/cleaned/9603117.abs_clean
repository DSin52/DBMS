$p'$-brane solutions to rank $p+1$ composite antisymmetric tensor fieldtheories of the kind developed by Guendelman, Nissimov and Pacheva are foundwhen the dimensionality of spacetime is $D=(p+1)+(p'+1)$. These field theoriesposses an infinite dimensional group of global Noether symmetries, that ofvolume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the target space of the scalar primitivefield constituents. Crucial in the construction of $p'$ brane solutions are theduality transformations of the fields and the local gauge field theoryformulation of extended objects given by Aurilia, Spallucci and Smailagic.Field equations are rotated into Bianchi identities after the dualitytransformation is performed and the Clebsch potentials associated with theHamilton-Jacobi formulation of the $p'$ brane can be identified with the$duals$ of the original scalar primitive constituents. Different types ofKalb-Ramond actions are discussed and a particular covariant action ispresented which bears a direct relation to the light-cone gauge $p$-braneaction. A simple derivation of $S$ and $T$ duality is also given. \medskip
