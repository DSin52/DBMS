Universal Lax pairs of the root type with spectral parameter and independentcoupling constants for twisted non-simply laced Calogero-Moser models areconstructed. Together with the Lax pairs for the simply laced models anduntwisted non-simply laced models presented in two previous papers, thiscompletes the derivation of universal Lax pairs for all of the Calogero-Mosermodels based on root systems. As for the twisted models based on B_n, C_n andBC_nroot systems, a new type of potential term with independent couplingconstants can be added without destroying integrability. They are calledextended twisted models. All of the Lax pairs for the twisted models presentedhere are new, except for the one for the F_4 model based on the short roots.The Lax pairs for the twisted G_2 model have some novel features. Derivation ofvarious functions, twisted and untwisted, appearing in the Lax pairs forelliptic potentials with the spectral parameter is provided. The origin of thespectral parameter is also naturally explained. The Lax pairs with spectralparameter, twisted and untwisted, for the hyperbolic, the trigonometric and therational potential models are obtained as degenerate limits of those for theelliptic potential models.
