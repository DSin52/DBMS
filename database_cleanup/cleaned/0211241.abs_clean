We provide evidence of the relation between supersymmetric gauge theories andmatrix models beyond the planar limit. We compute gravitational R^2 couplingsin gauge theories perturbatively, by summing genus one matrix model diagrams.These diagrams give the leading 1/N^2 corrections in the large N limit of thematrix model and can be related to twist field correlators in a collectiveconformal field theory. In the case of softly broken SU(N) N=2 super Yang-Millstheories, we find that these exact solutions of the matrix models agree withresults obtained by topological field theory methods.
