In this paper we discuss quantum modified moduli spaces in supergravity. Weexamine a model suggested by Izawa and Yanagida and by Intriligator and Thomasthat breaks global supersymmetry by a quantum deformation of the classicalmoduli space. We determine the minimum of the supergravity potential when thegauge coupling is taken to depend on a dynamical field, typically a modulus ofstring theory. We find that the only minimum is at the trivial configuration ofvanishing coupling constant and unbroken supersymmetry. We also discuss modelsinvolving more complicated superpotentials and find that the gauge coupling isonly stabilized in a supersymmetric ground state.
