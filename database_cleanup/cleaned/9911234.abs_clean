We construct the general model with only parallel positive tension 3-braneson $M^4 \times R^1$ and $M^4 \times R^1/Z_2$. The cosmology constant issectional constant along the fifth dimension. In this general scenario, the5-dimensional GUT scale on each brane can be indentified as the 5-dimensionalPlanck scale, but, the 4-dimensional Planck scale is generated from the low4-dimensional GUT scale exponentially in our world. We also give two simplemodels to show explicitly how to solve the gauge hierarchy problem.
