It has been shown how on-shell forward scattering amplitudes (the ``Bartonexpansion'') and quantum mechanical path integral (QMPI) can both be used tocompute temperature dependent effects in thermal field theory. We demonstratethe equivalence of these two approaches and then apply the QMPI to compute thehigh temperature expansion for the four-point function in QED, obtainingresults consistent with those previously obtained from the Barton expansion.
