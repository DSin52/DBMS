appear in PRDWe discuss the bulk Casimir effect (effective potential) for a conformal ormassive scalar when the bulk represents five-dimensional AdS or dS space withtwo or one four-dimensional dS brane, which may correspond to our universe.Using zeta-regularization, the interesting conclusion is reached, that for bothbulks in the one-brane limit the effective potential corresponding to themassive or to the conformal scalar is zero. The radion potential in thepresence of quantum corrections is found. It is demonstrated that both the dSand the AdS braneworlds may be stabilized by using the Casimir force only. Abrief study indicates that bulk quantum effects are relevant for branecosmology, because they do deform the de Sitter brane. They may also provide anatural mechanism yielding a decrease of the four-dimensional cosmologicalconstant on the physical brane of the two-brane configuration.
