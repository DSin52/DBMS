The classification of the octonionic realizations of the one-dimensionalextended supersymmetries is here furnished. These are non-associativerealizations which, albeit inequivalent, are put in correspondence with asubclass of the already classified associative representations for 1D extendedsupersymmetries. Examples of dynamical systems invariant under octonionicrealizations of the extended supersymmetries are given. We cite among theothers the octonionic spinning particles, the N=8 KdV, etc. Possibleapplications to supersymmetric systems arising from dimensional reduction ofthe octonionic superstring and M-theory are mentioned.
