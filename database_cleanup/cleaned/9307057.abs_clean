By analysing the infinite dimensional midisuperspace of spherically symmetricdust universes, and aply it to collapsing dust stars, one finds that thegeneral quantum state is a bound state. This leads to discrete spectrum. In thecase of a Schwarzschild black hole, the discrete spectrum implies Bekensteinarea. Knowing the microscopic (quantum) states, we suggest a microscopicquantum states forming a black hole, gives the Bekenstein- Hawking entropy. Allother thermodynamical quantities can be derived by using the standarddefinitions.
