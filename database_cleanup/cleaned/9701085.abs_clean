We present exact inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmological solutions oflow-energy string theory containing dilaton and axion fields. The spacetimemetric possesses cylindrical symmetry. The solutions describe ever-expandinguniverses with an initial curvature singularity and contain known homogeneoussolutions as subcases. The asymptotic form of the solution near the initialsingularity has a spatially-varying Kasner-like form. The inhomogeneous axionand dilaton fields are found to evolve quasi-homogeneously on scales largerthan the particle horizon. When the inhomogeneities enter the horizon theyoscillate as non-linear waves and the inhomogeneities attentuate. When theinhomogeneities are small they behave like small perturbations of homogeneousuniverses. The manifestation of duality and the asymptotic behaviour of thesolutions are investigated.
