Title: Wigner's Last Papers on Spacetime Symmetries

Comments: 10 pages,latex, a review talk presented at the 4th International

Wigner Symposium, Guadalajara, Mexico (August 1995)Wigner's 1939 paper on representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group isone of the most fundamental papers in physics. Wigner maintained his passionfor this subject throughout his life. In this report, I will review the paperswhich he published with me on this subject. These papers deal with the questionof unifying the internal space-time symmetries of massive and masslessparticles.
