gravity and (ii) higher-derivative dilatonic gravity. Both are renormalizablein $2+\epsilon$ dimensions and have a smooth limit for $\epsilon \rightarrow0$. The corresponding one-loop effective actions and beta-functions are found.Both theories are shown to possess a non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point ---forall dilatonic couplings--- in which the gravitational constant isasymptotically free. It is shown that in the regime of asymptotic freedom thematter central charge can be significantly increased by two differentmechanisms ---as compared with pure dilatonic gravity, where $n < 24$.
