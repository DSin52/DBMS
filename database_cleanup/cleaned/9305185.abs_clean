Target space duality (T duality), which interchanges Kaluza--Klein andwinding-mode excitations of the compactified heterotic string, is realized as asymmetry of a world-sheet action. Axion-dilaton duality (S duality), aconjectured nonperturbative SL(2,Z) symmetry of the same theory, plays ananalogous role for five-branes. We describe a soliton spectrum possessing bothduality symmetries and argue that the theory has an infinite number of dualstring descriptions.
