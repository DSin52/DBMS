Restricted to a black hole horizon, the ``gauge'' algebra of surfacedeformations in general relativity contains a Virasoro subalgebra with acalculable central charge. The fields in any quantum theory of gravity musttransform accordingly, i.e., they must admit a conformal field theorydescription. Applying Cardy's formula for the asymptotic density of states, Iuse this result to derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This method isuniversal---it holds for any black hole, and requires no details of quantumgravity---but it is also explicitly statistical mechanical, based on countingmicroscopic states.
