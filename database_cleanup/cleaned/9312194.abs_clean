We study the Hawking radiation for the geometry of an evaporating 1+1dimensional black hole. We compute Bogoliubov coefficients and the stresstensor. We use a recent result of Srednicki to estimate the entropy ofentanglement produced in the evaporation process, for the 1+1 dimensional holeand for the 3+1 dimensional hole. It is found that the one space dimensionalresult of Srednicki is the pertinent one to use, in both cases.
