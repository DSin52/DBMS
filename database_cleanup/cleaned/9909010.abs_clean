We study open descendants of four dimensional Z_N x Z_M orbifolds of thenon-supersymmetric type 0B string theory. An exhaustive analysis shows, thatusing the crosscap constraint the only model for which one can project out thetachyon is the Z_2 x Z_2 orbifold. For this case we explicitly construct theopen string amplitudes. The gauge group corresponding to the variousinequivalent Klein bottle projections turns out to be either symplectic orunitary.
