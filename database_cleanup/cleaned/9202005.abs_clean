Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D51 (1995) 4387-4393

We construct an exact CFT as an SL(2,R)xSU(2)/U(1)^2 gauged WZW model, whichdescribes a black hole in 4 dimensions. Another exact solution, describing ablack membrane in 4D (in the sense that the event horizon is an infinite plane)is found as an SL(2,R)xU(1)^2/U(1) gauged WZW model. Finally, we construct anexact solution of a 4D black hole with electromagnetic field, as anSL(2,R)xSU(2)xU(1)/U(1)^2 gauged WZW model. This black hole carries bothelectric and axionic charges.
