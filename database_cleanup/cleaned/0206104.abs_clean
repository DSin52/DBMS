We show that the pure spinor formalism proposed by Berkovits to covariantlyquantize superstrings is a gauge fixed, twisted version of the complexified n=2superembedding formulation of the superstring. This provides the Berkovitsapproach with a geometrical superdiffeomorphism invariant ground. As aconsequence, the absence of the worldsheet (super)diffeomorphism ghosts in thepure spinor quantization prescription and the nature of the Berkovits BRSTcharge and antighost are clarified. Since superembedding is classicallyequivalent to the Green-Schwarz formulation, we thus also relate the latter tothe pure spinor construction.
