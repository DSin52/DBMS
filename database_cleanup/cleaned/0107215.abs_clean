We investigate the complete phase diagram of the decoupled world-sheet theoryof (P,Q) strings. These theories include 1+1 dimensional super Yang-Millstheory and non-commutative open string theory. We find that the system exhibitsa rich fractal phase structure, including a cascade of alternatingsupergravity, gauge theory, and matrix string theory phases. The cascadeproceeds via a series of SL(2,Z) S-duality transformations, and dependssensitively on P and Q. In particular, we find that the system may undergomultiple Hagedorn-type transitions as the temperature is varied.
