Cosmological perturbations in the brane-world cosmology with a positivetension brane in the AdS background bulk geometry is analyzed by using thedoubly gauge-invariant formalism. We derive four independent equations forscalar perturbations in the plane symmetric (K=0) background. Three of theseequations are differential equations written in terms of gauge invariantvariables on the brane only, and another of them is an integro-differentialequation whose kernel is constructed formally from the Z_2-symmetric retardedGreen's function of the bulk gravitational waves. We compare these fourequations with the corresponding equations in the standard cosmology. As aby-product, we also obtain a set of equations which may be useful in numericalcalculations.
