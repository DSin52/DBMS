In this paper we discuss compactifications of type II superstrings where themoduli of the internal Calabi-Yau space vary over four-dimensional space time.The corresponding solutions of four-dimensional N=2 supergravity are given bycharged, extremal BPS black hole configurations with non-constant scalar fieldvalues. In particular we investigate the behaviour of our solutions near thosepoints in the Calabi-Yau moduli space where some internal cycles collapse andtopology change (flop transitions, conifold transitions) can take place. Thesingular loci in the internal space are related to special points in theuncompactified space. The phase transition can happen either at spatialinfinity (for positive charges) or on spheres (with at least one negativecharge). The corresponding BPS configuration has zero ADM mass and can beregarded as a domain wall that separates topologically different vacua of thetheory.
