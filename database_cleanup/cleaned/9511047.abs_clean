It is known that Ashtekar's formulation for pure Einstein gravity can be castinto the form of a topological field theory, namely the $SU(2)$ BF theory, withthe B-fields subject to an algebraic constraint. We extend this relationbetween Ashtekar's formalism and BF theories to $N=1$ and $N=2$ supergravities.The relevant gauge groups in these cases become graded Lie groups of $SU(2)$which are generated by left-handed local Lorentz transformations andleft-supersymmetry transformations. As a corollary of these relations, weprovide topological solutions for $N=2$ supergravity with a vanishingcosmological constant. It is also shown that, due to the algebraic constraints,the Kalb-Ramond symmetry which is characteristic of BF theories breaks down tothe symmetry under diffeomorphisms and right-supersymmetry transformations.
