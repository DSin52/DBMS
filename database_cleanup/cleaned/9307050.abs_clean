We present a simple derivation of the Callan-Harvey-Naculich effect, {\iti.e.} the compensation of charge violation on axion strings due to gaugeanomalies by accretion of charge onto the string from the surrounding space. Wethen show, in the case of axion fields without a potential, that an alternativeexplanation is possible in which no reference to the surrounding space isnecessary because the anomalies are cancelled by a version of the Green-Schwarzmechanism. We prove that such an alternative explanation is always possible inthe more general context of p-brane defects in d-dimensional field theories,and hence that there always exists an anomaly-free effective worldvolume actionwhenever the spacetime theory is anomaly free. Our results have implications,which we discuss, for heterotic and type II fivebranes.
