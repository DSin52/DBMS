We argue that the four-dimensional universe on the TeV brane of theRandall-Sundrum scenario takes the bimetric structure of Clayton and Moffat,with gravitons traveling faster than photons instead, while the radion varieswith time. We show that such brane world bimetric model can thereby solve theflatness and the cosmological constant problems, provided the speed of agraviton decreases to the present day value rapidly enough. The resolution ofother cosmological problems such as the horizon problem and the monopoleproblem requires supplementation by inflation, which may be achieved by theradion field provided the radion potential satisfies the slow-rollapproximation.
