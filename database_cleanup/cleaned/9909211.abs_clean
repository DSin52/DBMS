Applying the time-dependent variational principle of Balian and V\'en\'eroni,we derive variational approximations for multi-time correlation functions in$\Phi^4$ field theory. We assume first that the initial state is given andcharacterized by a density operator equal to a Gaussian density matrix. Then,we study the more realistic situation where only a few expectation values aregiven at the initial time and we perform an optimization with respect to theinitial state. We calculate explicitly the two-time correlation functions withtwo and four field operators at equilibrium in the symmetric phase.
