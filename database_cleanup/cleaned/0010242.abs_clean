The relation among spacetime supersymmetry algebras and superbrane actions isfurther explored. It is proved that $SL(2,\bR)$ belongs to the automorphismgroup of the ${\cal N}=2$ D=10 type IIB SuperPoincar\'e algebra. Its SO(2)subgroup is identified with a non-local SO(2) transformation found inhep-th/9806161. Performing T-duality, new non-local transformations are foundin type IIA relating, among others, BIon configurations with two D2-branesintersecting at a point. Its M-theory origin is explained. These results showthat part of the SuperPoincar\'e algebra automorphism group might be realizedon the field theory as non-local transformations.
