4777We discuss the one-loop effective potential and static (large $d$) potentialfor toroidal D-brane described by DBI-action in constant magnetic and inconstant electric fields. Explicit calculation is done for membrane case($p=2$) for both types of external fields and in case of static potential foran arbitrary $p$. In the case of one-loop potential it is found that thepresence of magnetic background may stabilize D-brane giving the possibilityfor non-pointlike ground state configuration. On the same time, constantelectrical field acts against stabilization and the correspondent one-looppotential is unbounded from below. The properties of static potential whichalso has stable minimum are described in detail. The back-reaction of quantumgauge fields to one-loop potential is also evaluated.
