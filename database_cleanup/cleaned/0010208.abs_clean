Title: No-go theorem for gravivector and graviscalar on the brane

Comments: 9 pages, comments and references added

We prove the no-go theorem that the gravivector $(h_{5\mu})$ and graviscalar$(h_{55})$ cannot have any on-shell propagation on the Randall-Sundrum (RS)brane. For this purpose, we analyze all of their linearized equations with thede Donder gauge (5D transverse-tracefree gauge).But we do not introduce any matter source. We use the Z$_2$-symmetry argumentand their ($h_{5\mu}, h_{55}$) compatibility conditions with the tensor$h_{\mn}$-equation. It turns out that $h_{55}$ does not have any bulk (massive)and brane (massless) propagations. Although $h_{5\mu}$ has a sort of massivepropagations, they do not belong to the physical solution. Hence we confirmthat the Randall-Sundrum gauge suffices the on-shell brane physics.
