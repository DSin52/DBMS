The perturbative prepotential and the K\"ahler metric of the vectormultiplets of the N=2 effective low-energy heterotic strings is calculateddirectly in N=1 six-dimensional toroidal compactifications of the heteroticstring vacua. This method provides the solution for the one loop correction tothe N=2 vector multiplet prepotential for compactifications of the heteroticstring for any rank three and four models, as well for compactifications on$K_3 \times T^2$. In addition, we complete previous calculations, derived fromstring amplitudes, by deriving the differential equation for the thirdderivative of the prepotential with respect of the usual complex structure Umoduli of the $T^2$ torus. Moreover, we calculate the one loop prepotential,using its modular properties, for N=2 compactifications of the heterotic stringexhibiting modular groups similar with those appearing in N=2 sectors of N=1orbifolds based on non-decomposable torus lattices and on N=2 supersymmetricYang-Mills.
