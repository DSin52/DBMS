We discuss the reduction of the open membrane metric and determine the(previously unknown) conformal factor. We also construct SL(2,R) invariant openstring metrics and complex open string coupling constants by reducing the openmembrane metric on a 2-torus. In doing so we also clarify some issues onmanifest SL(2,R) symmetry of the D3-brane. We remark on the consequences of ourresults for the recently conjectured existence of decoupled (p,q)non-commutative open string theories in type IIB string theory.
