We study the quantum group gauge theory developed elsewhere in the limit whenthe base space (spacetime) is a classical space rather than a general quantumspace. We show that this limit of the theory for gauge quantum group $U_q(g)$is isomorphic to usual gauge theory with Lie algebra $g$. Thus a new kind ofgauge theory is not obtained in this way, although we do find some differencesin the coupling to matter. Our analysis also illuminates certaininconsistencies in previous work on this topic where a different conclusion hadbeen reached. In particular, we show that the use of the quantum trace indefining a Yang-Mills action in this setting is not appropriate.
