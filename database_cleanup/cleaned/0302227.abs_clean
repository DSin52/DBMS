On the example of the three-dimensional Ising model, we show thatnonperturbative renormalization group equations allow one to obtain veryaccurate critical exponents. Implementing the order $\partial^4$ of thederivative expansion leads to $\nu=0.632$ and to an anomalous dimension$\eta=0.033$ which is significantly improved compared with lower orderscalculations.
