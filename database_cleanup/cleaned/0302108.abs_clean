This paper deals with magnetic equations of the type dH=J where the current Jis a delta-function on a brane worldvolume and H a p-form field strength. Inmany situations in M-theory this equation needs to be solved for H in terms ofa potential. A standard universality class of solutions, involvingDirac-branes, gives rise to strong intermediate singularities in H which inmany physically relevant cases lead to inconsistencies. In this paper wepresent an alternative universality class of solutions for magnetic equationsin terms of Chern-kernels, and provide relevant applications, among which theanomaly-free effective action for open M2-branes ending on M5-branes. Theunobservability of the Dirac-brane requires a Dirac quantization condition; weshow that the requirement of ``unobservability'' of the Chern-kernel leads inM-theory to classical gravitational anomalies which cancel precisely theirquantum counterparts.
