scalar source exhibits the phenomenon of Fermi-Bose transmutation. Thisprovides physical support to previous claims about transmutation betweenbosonic and fermionic one-dimensional structures in (3+1) dimensions. In orderto render the computations mathematically rigorous we have resorted to anEuclidean lattice regularization.
