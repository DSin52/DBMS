In this paper we construct path integral representations of the boundarystates in some special backgrounds such as the U(1) gauge field background, thelinear dilaton background and the open string tachyon background. The initialpurpose of this paper is to construct a general solution of the boundaryconformal field theory with the analytical approach, mainly for the constraintequations$(L_{n}-\tilde{L}_{-n}) |B > =0 $ are difficult to be solved to obtainthe solution represented by string modes from the pure algebraic approach.However in the path integral representation it is easy transforming thosealgebraic equations into the differential equations which can be solved.Another purpose of this paper is to try to explore an open question. we do notknow how to construct an exact theory of D-branes in the general backgrounduntil now. However many recent researches show the boundary state descriptionindeed seizes some fundamental features of D-branes in the rather specialbackgrounds. Since the general background field effects can be easilyintroduced in the path integral representation, we argue that path integralrepresentation of the boundary state should provide an exact description of Dbranes in the general backgrounds.
