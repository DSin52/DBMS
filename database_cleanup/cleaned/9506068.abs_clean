We use the methods of group theory to reduce the equations of motion of the$CP^{1}$ model in (2+1) dimensions to sets of two coupled ordinary differentialequations. We decouple and solve many of these equations in terms of elementaryfunctions, elliptic functions and Painlev{\'e} transcendents. Some of thereduced equations do not have the Painlev{\'e} property thus indicating thatthe model is not integrable, while it still posesses many properties ofintegrable systems (such as stable ``numerical'' solitons).
