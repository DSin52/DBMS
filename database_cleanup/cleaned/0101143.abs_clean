The consistency of the orbifold action on open strings between D-branes inorbifold theories with and without discrete torsion is analysed carefully. Forthe example of the C^3/Z_2 x Z_2 theory, it is found that the consistency ofthe orbifold action requires that the D-brane spectrum contains branes thatgive rise to a conventional representation of the orbifold group as well asbranes for which the representation is projective. It is also shown how theresults generalise to the orbifolds C^3/Z_N x Z_N for which a number of novelfeatures arise. In particular, the N>2 theories with minimal discrete torsionhave non-BPS branes charged under twisted R-R potentials that couple to none ofthe (known) BPS branes.
