The inflaton potential in four-dimensional theory is rather arbitrary, andfine-tuning is required generically. By contrast, inflation in the brane worldscenario has the interesting feature that the inflaton potential is motivatedfrom higher dimensional gravity, or more generally, from bulk modes or stringtheory. We emphasize this feature with examples. We also consider the impact onthe spectrum of density perturbation from a velocity-dependent potentialbetween branes in the brane inflationary scenario. It is likely that such apotential can have an observable effect on the ratio of tensor to scalarperturbations.
