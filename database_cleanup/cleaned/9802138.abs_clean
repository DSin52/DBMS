Title: Introduction to Supergravities in Diverse Dimensions

Authors: Y. Tanii

Comments: 43 pages, LaTeX

Supergravities in four and higher dimensions are reviewed. We discuss theaction and its local symmetries of N=1 supergravity in four dimensions,possible types of spinors in various dimensions, field contents of supergravitymultiplets, non-compact bosonic symmetries, non-linear sigma models, dualitysymmetries of antisymmetric tensor fields and super p-branes. (An expandedversion of a review talk at YITP workshop on Supersymmetry, 27 - 30 March,1996)
