We study Randall-Sundrum brane models from the viewpoint of condensedmatter/quantum optics. Following the idea of analog gravity we obtain effectivemetrics in fluid and Bose-Einstein-condensate systems mimicking those in thebrane framework. We see that the effect of warp factors in the bulk geometrytranslates into finite-size of the analog systems. We stress that many openquestions in braneworld physics can benefit from the understanding of criticalphenomena of surfaces in finite analog systems.
