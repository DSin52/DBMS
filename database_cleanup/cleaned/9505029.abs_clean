Multistring solutions of the string equations of motion are found forinflationary spacetimes with expansion factor $R(\eta)\propto \eta^k$ for any$k<0$ and $\eta$ conformal time. If $0>k>-1$ only two-string solutions can befound within our ansatz, whereas for $k=-1-1/n$, with $n=1,2,\ldots$,multistring solutions exist with an infinite number of strings [In the specialcase $k=-2$ we recover de Sitter spacetime where multistring solutions werefirst found].
