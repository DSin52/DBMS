The non-commutative geometry of a large auxiliary $B$-field simplifies theconstruction of D-branes as solitons in open string field theory. Similarly,fundamental strings are constructed as localized flux tubes in the string fieldtheory. Tensions are determined exactly using general properties of non-BPSbranes, and the non-Abelian structure of gauge fields on coincident D-branes isrecovered.
