We construct supergravity solutions dual to microstates of the D1-D3-D5system with nonzero B field moduli. Just like the D1-D5 solutions inhep-th/0109154 these solutions are generically nonsingular everywhere, with the`throat' closing smoothly near r=0. We write expressions relating theasymptotic supergravity fields to the integral brane charges. We study theinfall of a D1 brane down the throat of the geometries. This test brane`bounces' off the smooth end for generic initial conditions. The details of thebounce depend on both the choice of D1-D3-D5 microstate and the direction ofapproach of the infalling D1 brane. In the dual field theory description we seethat the tachyon mode starts to condense, but the tachyon bounces back up thepotential hill without reaching the deepest point of the potential.
