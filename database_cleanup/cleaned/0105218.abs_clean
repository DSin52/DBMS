A discussion of the AdS/CFT correspondence in IIB is given in a superspacecontext. The main emphasis is on the properties of SCFT correlators on theboundary which are studied using harmonic superspace techniques. Thesetechniques provide the easiest way of implementing the superconformal Wardidentities. The Ward identities, together with analyticity, can be used to givea compelling argument in support of the non-renormalisation theorems for two-and three-point functions, and to establish the triviality of extremal andnext-to-extremal correlation functions. The OPE in is also briefly discussed.
