The canonical quantization of the WZNW model provides a complete set ofexchange relations in the enlarged chiral state spaces that include the Gausscomponents of the monodromy matrices. Regarded as new dynamical variables, theelements of the latter cannot be identified -- they satisfy different exchangerelations. Accordingly, the two dimensional theory expressed in terms of theleft and right movers' fields does not automatically respect monodromyinvariance. Continuing our recent analysis of the problem by gauge theorymethods we conclude that physical states (on which the two dimensional fieldacts as a single valued operator) are invariant under the (permuted) coproductof the left and right $U_q(sl(n))$. They satisfy additional constraints fullydescribed for n=2.
