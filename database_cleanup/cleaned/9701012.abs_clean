Results about the phase structure of certain N=1 supersymmetric gaugetheories, which have been obtained as a consequence of holomorphy and`electric-magnetic' duality, are shown to be in quantitative agreementwith corresponding consequences of analyticity and superconvergence of thegauge field propagator. This connection is of interest, because thesuperconvergence arguments for confinement are not restricted to theorieswith supersymmetry. The method of reduction in the space of coupling parametersis used in order to define, beyond the matching conditions, an asymptoticallyfree, dual magnetic theory involving Yukawa couplings.
