We show that when the field strength H of the NS-NS B field does not vanish,the coordinates X and momenta P of an open string endpoints satisfy a set ofmixed commutation relations among themselves. Identifying X and P with thecoordinates and derivatives of the D-brane world volume, we find a new type ofnoncommutative spaces which is very different from those associated with aconstant B field background.
