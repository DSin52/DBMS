Recently Strachan introduced a Moyal algebraic deformation of selfdualgravity, replacing a Poisson bracket of the Plebanski equation by a Moyalbracket. The dressing operator method in soliton theory can be extended to thisMoyal algebraic deformation of selfdual gravity. Dressing operators are definedas Laurent series with coefficients in the Moyal (or star product) algebra, andturn out to satisfy a factorization relation similar to the case of the KP andToda hierarchies. It is a loop algebra of the Moyal algebra (i.e., of a$W_\infty$ algebra) and an associated loop group that characterize thisfactorization relation. The nonlinear problem is linearized on this loop groupand turns out to be integrable.
