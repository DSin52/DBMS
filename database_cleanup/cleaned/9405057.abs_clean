We show that a large class of incompressible quantum Hall states correspondto different representations of the \Winf algebra by explicit construction ofthe second quantized generators of the algebra in terms of fermion and vortexoperators. These are parametrized by a set of integers which are related to thefilling fraction. The class of states we consider includes multilayer Hallstates and the states proposed by Jain to explain the hierarchical fillingfractions. The corresponding second quantized order parameters are also given.
