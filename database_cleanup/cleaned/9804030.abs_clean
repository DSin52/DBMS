Title: Nonperturbative Field Correlators in the Abelian Higgs Model

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX, no figures, references are added

By making use of the duality transformation, gauge field correlators of theAbelian Higgs Model are studied in the London limit. The obtained results arein a good agreement with the dual Meissner scenario of confinement and with theStochastic Model of QCD vacuum. The nontrivial contribution to the quarticcorrelator arising due to accounting for the finiteness of the couplingconstant is discussed.
