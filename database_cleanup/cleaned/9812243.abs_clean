We propose to study the infrared behaviour of polymerised (or tethered)random manifolds of dimension D interacting via an exclusion condition with afixed impurity in d-dimensional Euclidean space in which the manifold isembedded. We prove rigorously, via methods of Wilson's renormalization group,the convergence to a non Gaussian fixed point for suitably chosen physicalparameters.
