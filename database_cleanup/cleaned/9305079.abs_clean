We study flows on the space of topological Landau-Ginzburg theories coupledto topological gravity. We argue that flows corresponding to gravitationaldescendants change the target space from a complex plane to a punctured complexplane and lead to the motion of punctures.It is shown that the evolution of thetopological theory due to these flows is given by dispersionless limit of KPhierarchy. We argue that the generating function of correlators in suchtheories are equal to the logarithm of the tau-function of GeneralizedKontsevich Model.
