Title: Line Bundles Over Families of (SUPER) Riemann Surfaces. I

Non-Graded CaseAuthors: U. Bruzzo and J.A. Dominguez Perez

Comments: 16 pages, AmSTeX. Requires a style with automatic numbering that is

available from the first authorA first step towards a systematic theory of relative line bundles overSUSY-curves is presented. In this paper we deal with the case of relative linebundles over families of ordinary Riemann surfaces. Generalizations of theGauss-Bonnet theorem and of the flatness theorem for line bundles arediscussed.
