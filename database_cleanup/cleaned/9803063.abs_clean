We give an outline of a recent proof that the low-energy effective gaugetheory exhibiting quark confinement due to magnetic monopole condensation canbe derived from QCD without any specific assumption. We emphasize that thelow-energy effective abelian gauge theories obtained here give the dualdescription of the same physics in the low-energy region. They show that theQCD vacuum is nothing but the dual (type II) superconductor.
