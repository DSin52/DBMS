In this note we consider a stringy description of black hole horizon. Westart with a nonlinear sigma model defined on a two dimensional Euclideansurface with background Rindler metric. By solving the field equations, we showthat to the leading order the Bekenstein-Hawking formula of black hole entropycan be produced. We also point out a relation between the present formalism andthe 'tHooft formalism.
