It has been conjectured that at the stationary point of the tachyon potentialfor the D-brane-anti-D-brane pair or for the non-BPS D-brane of superstringtheories, the negative energy density cancels the brane tensions. We study thisconjecture using a Wess-Zumino-Witten-like open superstring field theory freeof contact term divergences and recently shown to give 60% of the vacuum energyby condensation of the tachyon field alone. While the action is non-polynomial,the multiscalar tachyon potential to any fixed level involves only a finitenumber of interactions. We compute this potential to level three, obtaining 85%of the expected vacuum energy, a result consistent with convergence that canalso be viewed as a successful test of the string field theory. The resultingeffective tachyon potential is bounded below and has two degenerate globalminima. We calculate the energy density of the kink solution interpolatingbetween these minima finding good agreement with the tension of the D-brane ofone lower dimension.
