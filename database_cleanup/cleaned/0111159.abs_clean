We study the convergence of the derivative expansion for flow equations. Theconvergence strongly depends on the choice for the infrared regularisation.Based on the structure of the flow, we explain why optimised regulators lead tobetter physical predictions. This is applied to O(N)-symmetric real scalarfield theories in 3d, where critical exponents are computed for all N. Incomparison to the sharp cut-off regulator, an optimised flow improves theleading order result up to 10%. An analogous reasoning is employed for a propertime renormalisation group. We compare our results with those obtained by othermethods.
