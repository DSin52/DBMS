We present the analysis of all possible shortenings which occur for compositegauge invariant conformal primary superfields in SU(2,2/N) invariant gaugetheories. These primaries have top-spin range N/2 \leq J_{max} < N with J_{max}= J_1 + J_2, (J_1,J_2) being the SL(2,C) quantum numbers of the highest spincomponent of the superfield. In Harmonic superspace, analytic and chiralsuperfields give J_{max}= N/2 series while intermediate shortenings correspondto fusion of chiral with analytic in N=2, or analytic with different analyticstructures in N=3,4. In the AdS/CFT language shortenings of UIR's correspond toall possible BPS conditions on bulk states. An application of this analysis tomultitrace operators, corresponding to multiparticle supergravity states, isspelled out.
