Based on our previous work, in which a model of two dimensional dilatongravity of the type proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger wasrigorously quantized, we explicitly demonstrate how one can extract space-timegeometry in exactly solvable theory of quantum gravity. In particular, we havebeen able to produce a prototypical configuration in which a ( smeared ) mattershock wave generates a black hole without naked sigularity.
