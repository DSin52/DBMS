In a previous paper, it was shown that a soluble model can be constructed forthe description of a decaying system in analogy to the Lee-Friedrichs model ofcomplex quantum theory. It is shown here that this model also provides asoluble scattering theory, and therefore constitutes a model for a decayscattering system. Generalized second resolvent equations are obtained forquaternionic scattering theory. It is shown explicitly for this model, inaccordance with a general theorem of Adler, that the scattering matrix iscomplex subalgebra valued. It is also shown that the method of Adler, using aneffective optical potential in the complex sector to describe the effect of thequaternionic interactions, is equivalent to the general method of Green'sfunctions described here.
