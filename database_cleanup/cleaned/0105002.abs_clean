A new approach to constructing the noncommutative scalar field theory ispresented. Not only between x_i and p_j, we impose commutation relationsbetween x_is as well as p_js, and give a new representation of x_i,p_js. Wecarry out both first- and second-quantization explicitly. Thesecond-quantization is performed in both the operator formalism and thefunctional integral one.
