referencesThe bosonic IIB matrix model is studied using a numerical method. This modelcontains the bosonic part of the IIB matrix model conjectured to be anon-perturbative definition of the type IIB superstring theory. The large Nscaling behavior of the model is shown performing a Monte Carlo simulation. Theexpectation value of the Wilson loop operator is measured and the stringtension is estimated. The numerical results show the prescription of the doublescaling limit.
