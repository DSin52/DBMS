Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX. Talk presented by Csaba Csaki at the XXXIIIrd

Rencontres de Moriond, Electroweak Interactions and Unified Theories, LesArcs, Savoie, France, March 14-21, 1998We show how to extend the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions to discretesymmetries. We check these discrete anomaly matching conditions on severalproposed low-energy spectra of certain strongly interacting gauge theories. Theexcluded examples include the proposed chirally symmetric vacuum of pure N=1supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, certain non-supersymmetric confiningtheories and some self-dual N=1 supersymmetric theories based on exceptionalgroups.
