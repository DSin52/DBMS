The Aharonov-Bohm effect is analyzed for a spin-1/2 particle in the case thata $1/r$ potential is present. Scalar and vector couplings are each considered.It is found that the approach in which the flux tube is given a finite radiusthat is taken to zero only after a matching of boundary conditions does notgive physically meaningful results. Specifically, the operations of taking thelimit of zero flux tube radius and the Galilean limit do not commute. Thusthere appears to be no satisfactory solution of the relativisticAharonov-Bohm-Coulomb problem using the finite radius flux tube method.
