A quantization condition due to the boundary conditions and thecompatification of the light cone space-time coordinate $x^-$ is identified atthe level of the classical equations for the right-handed fermionic field intwo dimensions. A detailed analysis of the implications of the implementationof this quantization condition at the quantum level is presented. In the caseof the Thirring model one has selection rules on the excitations as a functionof the coupling and in the case of the Schwinger model a double integerstructure of the vacuum is derived in the light-cone frame. Two differentquantized chiral Schwinger models are found, one of them without a$\theta$-vacuum structure. A generalization of the quantization condition totheories with several fermionic fields and to higher dimensions is presented.
