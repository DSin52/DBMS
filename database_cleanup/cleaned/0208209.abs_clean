We reconsider light-cone superstring field theory on the maximallysupersymmetric pp-wave background. We find that the results for the fermionicNeumann matrices given so far in the literature are incomplete and verify ourexpressions by relating them to the bosonic Neumann matrices and provingseveral non-trivial consistency conditions among them, as for example thegeneralization of a flat space factorization theorem for the bosonic Neumannmatrices. We also study the bosonic and fermionic constituents of the prefactorand point out a subtlety in the relation between continuum and oscillator basisexpressions.
