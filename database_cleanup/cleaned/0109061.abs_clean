Title: The Stability of Matter and Landau Singularity in QED

Authors: Mofazzal Azam (BARC, MUMBAI, INDIA)

The theory of stability of relativistic matter seem to suggest that at highenough energies Quantum Electrodynamics may not be a well behaved theory.Weshow that this is true in the large flavour limit of QED. In this limit, Landausingularity becomes exact.We refer to the analogy of this model with the theoryof weakly interacting electron system analysed by Feldman {\it et al} usingrenormalisation group technique.We find an exact analogy between the Landausingularity in QED and BCS instability in the condensed matter system.Thisanalogy clearly shows that Landau singularity in QED is associated with theinstability of perturbative ground state.
