Superstring models describing curved 4-dimensional magnetic flux tubebackgrounds are exactly solvable in terms of free fields. We first consider thesimplest model of this type (corresponding to `Kaluza-Klein' Melvinbackground). Its 2d action has a flat but topologically non-trivial10-dimensional target space (there is a mixing of angular coordinate of the2-plane with an internal compact coordinate). We demonstrate that this theoryhas broken supersymmetry but is perturbatively stable if the radius R of theinternal coordinate is larger than R_0=\sqrt{2\a'}. In the Green-Schwarzformulation the supersymmetry breaking is a consequence of the presence of aflat but non-trivial connection in the fermionic terms in the action. For R <R_0 and the magnetic field strength parameter q > R/2\a' there appearinstabilities corresponding to tachyonic winding states. The torus partitionfunction Z(q,R) is finite for R > R_0 (and vanishes for qR=2n, n=integer). Atthe special points qR=2n (2n+1) the model is equivalent to the free superstringtheory compactified on a circle with periodic (antiperiodic) boundary conditionfor space-time fermions. Analogous results are obtained for a more generalclass of static magnetic flux tube geometries including the a=1 Melvin model.
