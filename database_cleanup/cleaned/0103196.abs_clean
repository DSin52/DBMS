Coincident D2-branes in open N=2 fermionic string theory with a B-fieldbackground yield an integrable modified U(n) sigma model on noncommutativeR^{2,1}. This model provides a showcase for an established method (the`dressing approach') to generate solutions for integrable field equations, evenin the noncommutative case. We demonstrate the technique by constructing movingU(1) and U(2) solitons and by computing their energies. It is outlined how toderive multi-soliton configurations with arbitrary relative motion; theycorrespond to D0-branes moving inside the D2-branes.
