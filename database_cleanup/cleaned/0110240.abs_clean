numbers (?)Authors: R. Flume, R. Poghossian, H. Storch

Comments: 21 pages, To be published in the collection ``From Integrable Models

to Gauge Theories'' (World Scientific, Singapore, 02) to honour SergeiMatinyan at the occasion of his 70'th birthdayThe $n$-instanton contribution to the Seiberg-Witten prepotential of ${\bfN}=2$ supersymmetric $d=4$ Yang Mills theory is represented as the integral ofthe exponential of an equivariantly exact form. Integrating out an overallscale and a U(1) angle the integral is rewritten as $(4n-3)$ fold product of aclosed two form. This two form is, formally, a representative of the Eulerclass of the Instanton moduli space viewed as a principal U(1) bundle, becauseits pullback under bundel projection is the exterior derivative of an angularone-form. We comment on a recent speculation of Matone concerning an analogylinking the instanton problem and classical Liouville theory of puncturedRiemann spheres.
