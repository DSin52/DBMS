We study F-theory compactified on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds that arerealised as hypersurfaces in toric varieties. The enhanced gauge group as wellas the number of massless tensor multiplets has a very simple description interms of toric geometry. We find a large number of examples where the gaugegroup is not a subgroup of E8xE8, but rather, is much bigger (with rank as highas 296). The largest of these groups is the group recently found by Aspinwalland Gross. Our algorithm can also be applied to elliptic fourfolds, for whichthe groups can become extremely large indeed (with rank as high as 121328). Wepresent the gauge content for two of the fourfolds recently studied by Klemm etal.
