We formulate WZW models based on a centrally extended version of theEuclidean group in $d$-dimensions. We obtain string backgrounds correspondingto conformal $\s$-models in $D=d^2$ space-time dimensions with exact centralcharge $c=d^2$ and $d(d-1)/2$ null Killing vectors. By identifying thecorresponding conformal field theory we show that the one loop results coincidewith the exact ones up to a shifting of a parameter.
