Some thermodynamical properties of Lovelock gravity are discussed in severalspace-time dimensions, the holographic principle being one of the ingredientsof the discussion. As it turns out, the area law and the brickwall method,though correct for the Einstein-Hilbert theory, may fail to work in general.
