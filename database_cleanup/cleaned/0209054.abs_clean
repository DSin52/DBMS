Title: Penrose limit and NCYM theories in diverse dimensions

Comments: 19 pages, LaTeX, no figures, v3

correctedWe obtain the Penrose limit of NCYM theories in dimensions $3 \leq d \leq 6$which originate from (D$(p-2)$, D$p$) supergravity bound state configurationsfor $2 \leq p \leq 5$ in the so-called NCYM limit. In most cases the Penroselimit does not lead to solvable string theories except for six-dimensional NCYMtheory. We obtain the masses of various bosonic coordinates and observe thatthey are light-cone time dependent and their squares can be negative as hasalso been observed in other cases in the literature. When the non-commutativeeffect is turned off we recover the results of Penrose limit of ordinaryD$p$-branes in the usual YM limit. We point out that for $d = 6$ NCYM theory,there exists another null geodesic in the neighborhood of which the Penroselimit leads to a solvable string theory. We briefly discuss the quantization ofthis theory.
