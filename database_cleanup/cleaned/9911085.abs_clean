We study Dirac commutators of canonical variables on D-branes with a constantNeveu-Schwarz 2-form field by using the Dirac constraint quantization method,and point out some subtleties appearing in previous works in analyzingconstraint structure of the brane system. Overcoming some ad hoc procedures, weobtain desirable noncommutative coordinates exactly compatible with the resultof the conformal field theory in recent literatures. Furthermore, we findinteresting commutator relations of other canonical variables.
