We discuss some issues related to D(2p)-D0 branes with background magneticfluxes respectively, in a T-dual picture, Dp-Dp branes at angles. Inparticular, we describe the nature of the supersymmetric bound states appearingafter tachyon condensation. We present a very elementary derivation of theconditions to be satisfied by such general supersymmetric gauge configurations,which are simply related by T-duality to the conditions for supersymmetricp-cycles in C^p.
