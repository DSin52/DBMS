We construct a Chern-Simons action for q-deformed gauge theory which is asimple and straightforward generalization of the usual one. Space-timecontinues to be an ordinary (commuting) manifold, while the gauge potentialsand the field strengths become q-commuting fields. Our approach, which isexplicitly carried out for the case of `minimal' deformations, has theadvantage of leading naturally to a consistent Hamiltonian structure that hasessentially all of the features of the undeformed case. For example, using thenew Poisson brackets, the constraints form a closed algebra and generateq-deformed gauge transformations.
