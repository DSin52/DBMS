The induced lattice gauge theory with various types of inducing fields infundamental representation of $SU(N_{c})$ is considered.In a simple case of one-plaquette lattice the model is solved in the large$N_{c}$ limit by means of loop equations.Comparison with the solution of usual QCD shows the equivalence of inducedand Wilson QCD providing that a mass and a number of flavours of inducingfields are sufficiently large. The possibility to take an asymptotically freecontinuum limit of induced QCD is discussed.
