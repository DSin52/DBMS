By studying cohomological quantum mechanics on the punctured plane,we wereled to identify (reduced) Bessel functions with homotopic loops living on theplane.This identification led us to correspondence rules between exponentialsand Bessel functions.The use of these rules makes us retrieve known but alsonew formulas in Bessel functions theory.
