We analyze the large $N$ spectrum of chiral primary operators of threedimensional fixed points of the renormalization group. Using the space-timepicture of the fixed points and the correspondence between anti-de Sittercompactifications and conformal field theories we are able to extract thedimensions of operators in short superconformal multiplets. We write down someof these operators in terms of short distance theories flowing to thesenon-trivial fixed points in the infrared.
