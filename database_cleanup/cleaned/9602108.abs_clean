We construct the twistor space associated with an HKT manifold, that is, ahyper-K\"ahler manifold with torsion, a type of geometry that arises as thetarget space geometry in two-dimensional sigma models with (4,0) supersymmetry.We show that this twistor space has a natural complex structure and is aholomorphic fibre bundle over the complex projective line with fibre theassociated HKT manifold. We also show how the metric and torsion of the HKTmanifold can be determined from data on the twistor space by a reconstructiontheorem. We give a geometric description of the sigma model (4,0) superfieldsas holomorphic maps (suitably understood) from a twistorial extension of (4,0)superspace (harmonic superspace) into the twistor space of the sigma modeltarget manifold and write an action for the sigma model in terms of these (4,0)superfields.
