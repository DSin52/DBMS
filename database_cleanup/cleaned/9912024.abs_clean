Vacuum spherically symmetric Einstein gravity in $N\ge 4$ dimensions can becast in a two-dimensional conformal nonlinear sigma model form by firstintegrating on the $(N-2)$-dimensional (hyper)sphere and then performing acanonical transformation. The conformal sigma model is described by two fieldswhich are related to the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass and to the radius of the$(N-2)$-dimensional (hyper)sphere, respectively. By quantizing perturbativelythe theory we estimate the quantum corrections to the ADM mass of a black hole.
