The formal extension of the T-duality rules for open strings from Abelian tonon-Abelian gauge field background leads in a well known manner to the notionof matrix valued D-brane position. The application of this concept to thenon-Abelian gauge field RG $\beta $-function of the corresponding $\sigma$-model yields a mass term in the gauge field dynamics on the matrix D-brane.The direct calculation in a corresponding D-brane model does $not$ yield such amass term, if the Dirichlet boundary condition is implemented as a constrainton the integrand in the defining functional integral. However, the mass termarises in the direct calculation for a D-brane model with dynamically realizedboundary condition.
