After a brief review on Matrix String Theory on flat backgrounds, weformulate matrix string models on different pp-wave backgrounds. This will bedone both in the case of constant and variable RR background flux for certainexact string geometries. We exhibit the non--perturbative representation ofstring interaction and show how the eigenvalue tunneling drives the WKBexpansion to give the usual perturbative string interaction also insupersymmetric pp-wave background cases.
