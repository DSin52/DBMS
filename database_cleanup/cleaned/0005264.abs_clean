We deal with quantum field theory in the restriction to external Bose fields.Let $(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - \mathcal{B})\psi=0$ be the Dirac equation. Weprove that a non-quantized Bose field $\mathcal{B}$ is a functional of theDirac field $\psi$, whenever this $\psi$ is strictly canonical. Performing thefree Dirac field, we also prepare the tedious verifications for all$\mathcal{B}$ which are non-quantized and static. Such verifications must notbe confused, however, with the easy and rigorous proof of our formula, which isshown in detail.
