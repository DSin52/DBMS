Title: Unitary Continuous Representations of Compact Quantum Groups

Comments: 8 pages

Generalizing the notion of continuous Hilbert space representations ofcompact topological groups we define unitary continuous correpresentations of$C^*$-completions of compact quantum group Hopf algebras on arbitrary Hilbertspaces. It is proved that the unitary continuous correpresentations decomposein finite dimensional irreducible correpresentations.
