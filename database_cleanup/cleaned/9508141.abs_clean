An account is given of a technique for testing the equivalence between anexact factorizable S-matrix and an asymptotically-free Lagrangian field theoryin two space-time dimensions. The method provides a way of resolving CDDambiguities in the S-matrix and it also allows for an exact determination ofthe physical mass in terms of the Lambda parameter of perturbation theory. Theresults for various specific examples are summarized.
