We compute the $1/N$ correction to the location of the previously foundfirst-order phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model at a chemical potential$\mu = \mu_c = {1 \over \sqrt{2}} m$, where $m$ is the fermion mass. Weemploy an expression for the free energy $f(\mu)$ given by the thermodynamicBethe ansatz under the approximation that the fundamental fermions dominatethe ground state, and combine it with the effective potential evaluated atzero chemical potential. Our result is $\mu_c = {m \over \sqrt{2}} [1 - {0.47\over N}]$.
