The problem of how to put interactions in two-dimensional quantum gravity inthe strong coupling regime is studied. It shows that the most generalinteraction consistent with this symmetry is a Liouville term that contain twoparameters $(\alpha, \beta)$ satisfying the algebraic relation $2\beta - \alpha=2$ in order to assure the closure of the diffeomorphism algebra. The model isclassically soluble and it contains as general solution the temporalsingularity. The theory is quantized and we show that the propagation amplitudefall tozero in $\tau =0$. This result shows that the classical singularitiesare smoothed by quantum effects and the bing-bang concept could be consideredas a classical extrapolation instead of a physical concept.
