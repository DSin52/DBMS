Dynamical supersymmetry breaking is a fascinating theoretical problem. It isalso of phenomenological significance. A better understanding of thisphenomenon can help in model building, which in turn is useful in guiding thesearch for supersymmetry. In this article, we review the recent developments inthe field. We discuss a few examples, which allow us to illustrate the mainideas in the subject. In the process, we also show how the techniques ofholomorphy and duality come into play. Towards the end we indicate how thesedevelopments have helped in the study of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking.The review is intended for someone with a prior knowledge of supersymmetry whowants to find out about the recent progress in this field.
