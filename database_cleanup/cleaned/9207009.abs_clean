We study the classical and quantum $G$ extended superconformal algebras fromthe hamiltonian reduction of affine Lie superalgebras, with even subalgebras$G\oplus sl(2)$. At the classical level we obtain generic formulas for thePoisson bracket structure of the algebra. At the quantum level we get freefield (Feigin-Fuchs) representations of the algebra by using the BRST formalismand the free field realization of the affine Lie superalgebra. In particular weget the free field representation of the $sl(2)\oplus sp(2N)$ extendedsuperconformal algebra from the Lie superalgebra $osp(4|2N)$. We also discussthe screening operators of the algebra and the structure of singular vectors inthe free field representation.
