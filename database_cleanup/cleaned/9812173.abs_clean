The relation between connections on 2-dimensional manifolds and holomorphicbundles provides a new perspective on the role of classical gauge fields inquantum field theory in two, three and four dimensions. In particular we showthat there is a close relation between unstable bundles and monopoles,sphalerons and instantons. Some of these classical configurations emerge asnodes of quantum vacuum states in non-confining phases of \qft which suggests arelevant role for those configurations in the mechanism of quark confinement inQCD.
