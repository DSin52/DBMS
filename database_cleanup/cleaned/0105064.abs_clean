The Sp(2)-gauge fixing of N = 1 super-Yang-Mills theory is considered here.We thereby apply the triplectic scheme, where two classes of gauge-fixingbosons are introduced. The first one depends only on the gauge field, whereasthe second boson depends on this gauge field and also on a pair of Majoranafermions. In this sense, we build up the BRST extended (BRST plus antiBRST)algebras for the model, for which the nilpotency relations,s^2_1=s^2_2=s_1s_2+s_2s_1=0, hold.
