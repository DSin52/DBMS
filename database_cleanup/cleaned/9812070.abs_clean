Relativistic effects in the thermodynamical properties of interactingparticle systems are investigated within the framework of the relativisticdirect interaction theory in various forms of dynamics. In the front form ofrelativistic dynamics an exactly solvable model of a one-dimensional hardspheres gas is formulated and an equation of state and thermodynamicalpotentials for such a gas are found. Weakly-relativistic corrections to thethermodynamical functions of the dilute gas with short-range interactions arediscussed on the basis of the approximately relativistic Hamiltonian functionin the instant form of dynamics.
