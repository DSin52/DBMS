We introduce a new localization principle which is a generalized canonicaltransformation. It unifies BRST localization, the non-abelian localizationprinciple and a special case of the conformal Duistermaat-Heckman integrationformula of Paniak, Semenoff and Szabo. The heat kernel on compact Lie groups islocalized in two ways. First using a non-abelian generalization of thederivative expansion localization of Palo and Niemi and secondly using the BRSTlocalization principle and a configuration space path integral. In addition wepresent some new formulas on homogeneous spaces which might be useful in apossible localization of Selberg's trace formula on locally homogeneous spaces.
