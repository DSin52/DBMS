The continuous and discrete symmetries of the Dirac-type operators producedby particular Killing-Yano tensors are studied in manifolds of arbitrarydimensions. The Killing-Yano tensors considered are covariantly constant andrealize certain square roots of the metric tensor. Such a Killing-Yano tensorproduces simultaneously a Dirac-type operator and the generator of aone-parameter Lie group connecting this operator with the standard Dirac one.The Dirac operators are related among themselves through continuous or discretetransformations. The groups U(1) and SU(2) of continuous transformations aretypical for (hyper-)Kahler spaces, but in general the requirements for thesespecial geometries are not fulfilled. The discrete symmetries are also studiedobtaining the discrete groups Z_4 and Q. The briefly presented examples are theEuclidean Taub-NUT space and the Minkowski spacetime.
