We discuss the $N=2$ super $W$ algebras from the hamiltonian reduction ofaffine Lie superalgebras $A(n|n-1)^{(1)}$ and $A(n|n)^{(1)}$. From the quantumhamiltonian reduction of $A(n|n-1)^{(1)}$ we get the free field realization of$N=2$ $CP_{n}$ super coset models. In the case of the affine Lie superalgebras$A(n|n)^{(1)}$, the corresponding conformal field theories do not have $N=2$superconformal symmetry. However we show that these models are twisted $N=2$$CP_{n}$ models and may be regarded as topological conformal field theories.(Talk presented at the International Workshop on "String Theory, QuantumGravity and the Unification of Fundamental Interactions" Rome, September21--26, 1992)
