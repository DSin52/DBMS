The BRST cohomology of 1+1 strings in a free light-cone gauge contains onlythe two-dimensional tachyon, and excludes all excited states of both matter andghosts, including the special states that arise in the continuum conformalgauge quantization and in the $c = 1$ matrix models. This exclusion takes placeat a very basic level, and therefore may signal some serious problems or atleast unresolved issues involved in this gauge choice.
