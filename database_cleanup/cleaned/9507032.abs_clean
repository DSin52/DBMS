In this paper we discuss the hyperelliptic curve for $N=2$ $SU(3)$ superYang-Mills with six flavors of hypermultiplets. We start with a generic genustwo surface and construct the curve in terms of genus two theta functions. Fromthis one can construct the curve for $m_i=u=0$. This curve is explicitly dualunder a subgroup of $Sp(4,Z)$ which is not isomorphic to $Sp(2,Z)$. We thenproceed to construct the curve for the general $SU(3)$ theory and discuss theduality properties of the theory. The results given here differ from thosegiven previously.
