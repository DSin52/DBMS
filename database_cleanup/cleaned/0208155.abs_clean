Gauge fields in exotic representations of the Lorentz group in D dimensions -i.e. ones which are tensors of mixed symmetry corresponding to Young tableauxwith arbitrary numbers of rows and columns - naturally arise through massivestring modes and in dualising gravity and other theories in higher dimensions.We generalise the formalism of differential forms to allow the discussion ofarbitrary gauge fields. We present the gauge symmetries, field strengths, fieldequations and actions for the free theory, and construct the various dualtheories. In particular, we discuss linearised gravity in arbitrary dimensions,and its two dual forms.
