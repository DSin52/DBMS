399-416The relationship between the perturbation theory in light-front coordinatesand Lorentz-covariant perturbation theory is investigated. A method for findingthe difference between separate terms of the corresponding series without theirexplicit evaluation is proposed. A procedure of constructing additionalcounter-terms to the canonical Hamiltonian that compensate this difference atany finite order is proposed. For the Yukawa model, the light-front Hamiltonianwith all of these counter-terms is obtained in a closed form. Possibleapplication of this approach to gauge theories is discussed.
