Title: Biconformal Matter Actions

Authors: Andre Wehner and James T. Wheeler

We extend 2n-dim biconformal gauge theory by including Lorentz-scalar matterfields of arbitrary conformal weight. We show that for a massless scalar fieldof conformal weight zero in a torsion-free biconformal geometry, the solutionis determined by the Einstein equation on an n-dim submanifold, with thestress-energy tensor of the scalar field as source. The matter field satisfiesthe n-dim Klein-Gordon equation.
