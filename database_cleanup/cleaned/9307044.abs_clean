For a dissipative system with Ohmic friction, we obtain a simple and exactsolution for the wave function of the system plus the bath. It is described bythe direct product in two independent Hilbert space. One of them is describedby an effective Hamiltonian, the other represents the effect of the bath, i.e.,the Brownian motion, thus clarifying the structure of the wave function of thesystem whose energy is dissipated by its interaction with the bath. No pathintegral technology is needed in this treatment. The derivation of theWeisskopf-Wigner line width theory follows easily.
