We analyze the properties of mesons in 1+1 dimensional QCD with bosonic andfermionic ``quarks'' in the large $\nc$ limit. We study the spectrum in detailand show that it is impossible to obtain massless mesons including bosonconstituents in this model. We quantitatively show how the QCD mass inequalityis realized in two dimensional QCD. We find that the mass inequality is closeto being an equality even when the quarks are light. Methods for obtaining theproperties of ``mesons'' formed from boson and/or fermion constituents areformulated in an explicit manner convenient for further study. We also analyzehow the physical properties of the mesons such as confinement and asymptoticfreedom are realized.
