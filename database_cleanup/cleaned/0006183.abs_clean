We use the Wilson renormalization group (RG) formulation to solve thefine-tuning procedure needed in renormalization schemes breaking the gaugesymmetry. To illustrate this method we systematically compute the non-invariantcouplings of the ultraviolet action of the SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory atone-loop order.
