The combinatorics of the BPHZ subtraction scheme for a class of ladder graphsfor the three point vertex in $\phi^3$ theory is transcribed into certainconnectivity relations for marked chord diagrams (knots with transversalintersections). The resolution of the singular crossings using the equivalencerelations in these examples provides confirmation of a proposed fundamentalrelationship between knot theory and renormalization in perturbative quantumfield theory.
