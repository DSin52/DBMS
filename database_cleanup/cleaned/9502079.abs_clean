Title: Elusive Order Parameters for Non-Abelian Gauge Theories

Comments: companion paper to hep-th/9502080. Problem with figures fixed. 11

pages, 2 figures, RevtexIn this Letter, we construct a set of order parameters for non-Abelian gaugetheories which probe directly the unbroken group and are free of thedeficiencies caused by quantum fluctuations and gauge fixing which have plaguedall previous attempts. These operators can be used to map out the phase diagramof a non-Abelian gauge theory.
