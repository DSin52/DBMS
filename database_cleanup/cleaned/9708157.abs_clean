Multidimensional cosmological model describing the evolution of n+1 Einsteinspaces in the theory with several scalar fields and forms is considered. When a(electro-magnetic composite) p-brane Ansatz is adopted the field equations arereduced to the equations for Toda-like system. The Wheeler-De Witt equation isobtained. In the case when n "internal" spaces are Ricci-flat, one space M_0has a non-zero curvature, and all p-branes do not "live" in M_0, the classicaland quantum solutions are obtained if certain orthogonality relations onparameters are imposed. Spherically-symmetric solutions with intersectingnon-extremal p-branes are singled out. A non-orthogonal generalization ofintersection rules corresponding to (open, closed) Toda lattices is obtained. Achain of bosonic D > 11 models (that may be related to hypothetical higherdimensional supergravities and F-theories) is suggested.
