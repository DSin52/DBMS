We present an ansatz for all one-loop amplitudes in pure Einstein gravity forwhich the n external gravitons have the same outgoing helicity. These loopamplitudes, which are rational functions of the momenta, also arise in thequantization of self-dual gravity in four-dimensional Minkowski space. Ouransatz agrees with explicit computations via D-dimensional unitarity cuts for nless than or equal to 6. It also has the expected analytic behavior, for all n,as a graviton becomes soft, and as two momenta become collinear. The gravityresults are closely related to analogous amplitudes in (self-dual) Yang-Millstheory.
