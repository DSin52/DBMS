The radion dynamics related to the presence of moving branes with bothpositive or negative tensions is studied in the linearized approximation. Theradion effective Lagrangian is computed for a compact system with three branesand in particular we examine the decompactification limit when one brane issent to infinity. In the non-compact case we calculate the coupling of thegravitational modes (graviton, dilaton and radion) to matter on the branes. Thecharacter of gravity on the two branes for all possible combinations of branetensions is also discussed. It turns out that one can have a normalizabledilaton mode even in the non-compact case. Finally, we speculate on the role ofmoving branes as a possible source of radion emission.
