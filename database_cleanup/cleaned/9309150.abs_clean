We consider a new perturbation scheme in nonabelian gauge theory. PureYang-Mills theory in three dimensions is taken as a concrete example. Thezeroth-order in the perturbative expansion is given by BF theory coupled to aSt{\" u}ckelberg-like field. The effective coupling for the expansion can besmall in the infrared regime, which implies that nonperturbative treatment ofYang-Mills theory may be partially reduced to that of BF theory.
