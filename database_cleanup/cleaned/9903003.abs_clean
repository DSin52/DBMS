We discuss the field theory limit of Dp-branes. In this limit, the blackDp-brane solution approaches a solution which is conformal to adS_{p+2} \timesS^{8-p}. We argue that the frame in which the conformal factor is equal to one,the dual frame, is a `holographic' frame. The radial coordinate of adS_{p+2}provides a UV/IR connection as in the case of the D3 brane. The gravitationaldescription involves gauged supergravities, typically with non-compact gaugegroups. The near-horizon Dp-brane solution becomes a domain-wall solution ofthe latter.
