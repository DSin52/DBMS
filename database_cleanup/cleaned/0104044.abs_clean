We present supersymmetric solutions for the theory of gauged supergravity infive dimensions obtained by gauging the shift symmetry of the axion of theuniversal hypermultiplet. This gauged theory can also be obtained bydimensionally reducing M-theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold with background flux.The solution found preserves half of the N=2 supersymmetry, carries electricfields and has nontrivial scalar field representing the CY-volume. We commenton the possible solutions of more general hypermultiplet gauging.
