We summarize our renormalization group approach for the vector model as wellas the matrix model which are the discretized quantum gravity in one- andtwo-dimensional spacetime. A difference equation is obtained which relates freeenergies for neighboring values of $N$. The reparametrization freedom in fieldspace is formulated by means of the loop equation. The reparametrizationidentities reduce the flow in the infinite dimensional coupling constant spaceto that in finite dimensions. The matrix model gives a nonlinear differentialequation as an effective renormalization group equation. The fixed point andthe susceptibility exponents can be determined even for the matrix models inspite of the nonlinearity. They agree with the exact result.
