We generalize the Marinari-Parisi definition for pure two dimensional quantumgravity $(k = 2)$ to all non unitary minimal multicritical points $(k \geq 3)$.The resulting interacting Fermi gas theory is treated in the collective fieldframework. Making use of the fact that the matrices evolve in Langevin time,the Jacobian from matrix coordinates to collective modes is similar to thecorresponding Jacobian in $d = 1$ matrix models. The collective field theory isanalyzed in the planar limit. The saddle point eigenvalue distribution is theone that defines the original multicritical point and therefore exhibits theappropriate scaling behaviour. Some comments on the nonperturbative propertiesof the collective field theory as well as comments on the Virasoro constraintsassociated with the loop equations are made at the end of this letter. There wealso make some remarks on the fermionic formulation of the model and itsintegrability, as a nonlocal version of the non linear Schr\"{o}dinger model.
