Title: Worldline Supersymmetry and Dimensional Reduction

Comments: 10 pages

For any worldline reformulation of a quantum field theory for Dirac fermions,this paper shows that worldline supersymmetry may generally be enforced by thevanishing of the commutator of the Dirac operator with the worldlineHamiltonian. The action of supersymmetry on the worldline Lagrangian may not,however, be written in terms of the variations on the fields in the usual way,except when the spinning particle couples just to a one-form. By reduction fromsix to four dimensions of the worldline reformulation for a spinning particlecoupled to a three-form, corrections to the superworldline Lagrangian arepresented which are needed in order to reproduce correct field theory resultsfrom worldline perturbation theory in an unambiguous way.
