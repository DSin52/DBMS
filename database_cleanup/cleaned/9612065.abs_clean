Title: Integrable Classical and Quantum Gravity

Comments: 41 pages, 2 figures, Lectures given at NATO Advanced Study Institute

on Quantum Fields and Quantum Space Time, Cargese, France, 22 July - 3 AugustIn these lectures we report recent work on the exact quantization ofdimensionally reduced gravity, i.e. 2d non-linear (G/H)-coset spacesigma-models coupled to gravity and a dilaton. Using methods developed in thecontext of flat space integrable systems, the Wheeler-DeWitt equations forthese models can be reduced to a modified version of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikovequations from conformal field theory, the insertions given by singularities inthe spectral parameter plane. This basic result in principle permits theexplicit construction of solutions, i.e. physical states of the quantizedtheory. In this way, we arrive at integrable models of quantum gravity withinfinitely many self-interacting propagating degrees of freedom.
