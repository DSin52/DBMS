We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate three point functions ofchiral primary operators at large N in d=3, N=8 and d=6, N=(2,0) superconformalfield theories. These theories are related to the infrared fixed points ofworld-volume descriptions of N coincident M2 and M5 branes, respectively. Thecomputation can be generalized by employing a gravitational action in arbitrarydimensions D, coupled to a (p+1)-form and appropriately compactified onreproduces for D=10, p=3 the three point functions of d=4, N=4 SYM chiralprimary operators at large N.
