The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we provide a simple and pedagogicaldiscussion of how compactifications of M-theory or supergravity preserving somefour-dimensional supersymmetry naturally lead to reduced holonomy or itsgeneralization, reduced weak holonomy. We relate the existence of a (conformal)Killing spinor to the existence of certain closed and co-closed p-forms, and tothe metric being Ricci flat or Einstein. Then, for seven-dimensional manifolds,we show that octonionic self-duality conditions on the spin connection areequivalent to G_2 holonomy and certain generalized self-duality conditions toweak G_2 holonomy. The latter lift to self-duality conditions forcohomogeneity-one spin(7) metrics. To illustrate the power of this approach, wepresent several examples where the self-duality condition largely simplifiesthe derivation of a G_2 or weak G_2 metric.
