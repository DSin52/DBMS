The dS/CFT correspondence is illuminated through an analysis of massivescalar field theory in d-dimensional de Sitter space. We consider aone-parameter family of dS-invariant vacua related by Bogolyubovtransformations and compute the corresponding Green functions. It is shown thatnone of these Green functions correspond to the one obtained by analyticcontinuation from AdS. Among this family of vacua are in (out) vacua which haveno incoming (outgoing) particles on past (future) infinity. Surprisingly, it isshown that in odd spacetime dimensions the in and out vacua are the same,implying the absence of particle production for this state. The correlators ofthe boundary CFT, as defined by the dS/CFT correspondence, are shown to dependon the choice of vacuum state - the correlators with all points on pastinfinity vanish in the in vacuum. For dS_3 we argue that this bulk vacuumdependence of the correlators is dual to a deformation of the boundary CFT_2 bya specific marginal operator. It is also shown that Witten's non-standard deSitter inner product (slightly modified) reduces to the standard inner productof the boundary field theory. Next we consider a scalar field in the Kerr-dS_3Euclidean vacuum. A density matrix is constructed by tracing out over modeswhich are causally inaccessible to a single geodesic observer. This is shown tobe a thermal state at the Kerr-dS_3 temperature and angular potential. It isfurther shown that, assuming Cardy's formula, the microscopic entropy of such athermal state in the boundary CFT precisely equals the Bekenstein-Hawking valueof one quarter the area of the Kerr-dS_3 horizon.
