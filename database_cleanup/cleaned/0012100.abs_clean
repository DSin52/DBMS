The interplay between topological defects (branes) and black holes has been asubject of recent study, motivated in part by interest in brane-worldscenarios. In this paper we analyze in detail the description of a black holebound to a domain wall (a two-brane in four dimensions), for which an exactdescription in the limit of zero wall thickness has been given recently. Weshow how to smooth this singular solution with a thick domain wall. We alsoshow that charged extremal black holes of a size (roughly) smaller than thebrane thickness expel the wall, thereby extending the phenomenon of fluxexpulsion. Finally, we analyze the process of black hole nucleation {\it on} adomain wall, and argue that it is preferred over a previously studied mechanismof black hole nucleation {\it away} from the wall.
