We describe actions that correspond to the interaction of the Super Virasoroalgebra with supergravitons. These new field theories introduce a superfieldthat corresponds to dual elements of the super Virasoro algebra. We are alsoable to extend the definition of these field theories to higher dimensions. Weexplicitly exhibit the 2, 3 and 4 dimensional cases. Remarkably, thefundamental prepotentials describing these dual elements of the super Virasoroalgebra, in each model, agrees with the known prepotentials of thecorresponding supergravity theory. These theories might be important in thequantization of the super Virasoro group, supergravity and in AdS and super AdSgravity.
