We study the fluctuation modes for lump solutions of the tachyon effectivepotential in p-adic open string theory. We find a discrete spectrum withequally spaced mass squared levels. We also find that the interactions derivedfrom this field theory are consistent with p-adic string amplitudes for excitedstring states.
