We test the unified-gauge formalism by computing a Wilson loop in Yang-Millstheory to one-loop order. The unified-gauge formalism is characterized by theabritrary, but fixed, four-vector $N_\mu$, which collectively represents thelight-cone gauge $(N^2 = 0)$, the temporal gauge $(N^2 > 0)$, the pure axialgauge $(N^2 < 0)$ and the planar gauge $(N^2 < 0)$. A novel feature of thecalculation is the use of distinct sets of vectors, $\{ n_{\mu}, n_{\mu}^{\ast}\}$ and $\{N_{\mu}, N_{\mu}^{\ast}\}$, for the path and for the gauge-fixingconstraint, respectively. The answer for the Wilson loop is independent of$N_{\mu}$, and agrees numerically with the result obtained in the Feymmangauge.
