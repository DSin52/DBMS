An explicit Lorentz covariant formulation of the canonical theory forclassical fields is established on a space-like hypersurface. Hamilton'sequations and a Poisson bracket are defined on the space-like hypersurface. ThePoisson bracket relations between total momentum and total angular momentumsatisfies the Poincar{\'e} algebra. It is shown that our Poisson bracket hasthe same symplectic structure that was brought in the covariant symplecticapproach.
