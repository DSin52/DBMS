We reconsider the, by Brink and Vasiliev, recently proposed generalized Todafield theories using the framework of WZNW$\rightarrow$Toda reduction. Thereduced theory has a gauge symmetry which can be fixed in various ways. Wediscuss some different gauge choices. In particular we study the ${\cal W}$algebra associated with the generalized model in some different realizations,corresponding to different gauge choices. We also investigate the mappingbetween the Toda field and a free field and show the relation between the${\cal W}$ algebra generators expressed in terms of the two different fields.All results apply also to the case of ordinary Toda theories.
