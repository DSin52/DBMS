Title: N=1 SUSY inspired Whitham prepotentials and WDVV

Authors: A.Mironov

Comments: 7 pages, references added, based on talk presented at the 35th

Symposium AhrenshoopThis brief review deals with prepotentials inspired by N=1 SUSYconsiderations due to Cachazo, Intrilligator, Vafa. These prepotentialsassociated with matrix models following Dijkgraaf and Vafa should be consideredas given on an enlarged moduli space that includes Whitham times (couplings ofthe superpotential). This moduli space is nothing but the whole moduli space of(decorated) hyperelliptic curves. Corresponding prepotentials are logarithms of(quasiclassical) tau-functions and satisfy the WDVV equations.
