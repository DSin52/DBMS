We have extended previous analysis of the bulk/brane supersymmetrizationsinvolving non-zero brane mass terms of bulk fermions (gravitini) and twistingof boundary conditions. We have constructed new brane/bulk models that may berelevant for realistic model building. In particular, we have built a modelwith the Randall-Sundrum bosonic sector, orthogonal projection operators on thebranes in the fermionic sector, and an unbroken N=1 supersymmetry. We have alsoconstructed 5d super-bigravity with static vacuum and unbroken N=1supersymmetry, which may be viewed as a deconstruction of 5d supergravity.
