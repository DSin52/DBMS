Comments: 6 pages, RevTex4

We show that, contrary to common belief, the propagation of a spin-2 field inan electromagnetic background is {\em causal}. The proof will be given in theFierz formalism which, as we shall see, is free of the ambiguity present in themore usual Einstein representation. We shall also review the proof in thislatter representation.
