We obtain a solution to eleven-dimensional supergravity that consists ofM2-branes embedded in a dielectric distribution of M5-branes. Contrary tonormal expectations, this solution has maximal supersymmetry for a branesolution (i.e. sixteen supercharges). While the solution is constructed usinggauged supergravity in four dimensions, the complete eleven-dimensionalsolution is given. In particular, we obtain the Killing spinors explicitly, andwe find that they are characterised by a duality rotation of the standardDirichlet projection matrix for M2-branes.
