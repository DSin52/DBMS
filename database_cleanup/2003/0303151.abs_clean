We present a novel derivation of the duality between the two-dimensionalEuclidean black hole and supersymmetric Liouville theory. We realise these(1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories on the worldvolume of domain wallsin a (2+1)-dimensional gauge theory. We show that there exist two complementarydescriptions of the domain wall dynamics, resulting in the two mirror conformalfield theories. In particular, effects which are usually attributed toworldsheet instantons are captured by the classical scattering of domain walls.
