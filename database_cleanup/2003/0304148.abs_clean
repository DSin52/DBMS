We study the regularization of theories of ``brane induced'' gravity incodimension $N>1$. The brane can be interpreted as a thin dielectric with alarge dielectric constant, embedded in a higher dimensional space. The kineticterm for the higher dimensional graviton is enhanced over the brane. A fourdimensional gravitation is found on the brane at distances smaller than acritical distance $r<r_c$, and is due to the exchange of a massive resonantgraviton. The crossover scale $r_c$ is determined by the mass of the resonance.The suppression of the couplings of light Kaluza-Klein modes to brane matterresults in a higher dimensional force law at large distances. We show that theresulting theory is free of ghosts or tachyons.
