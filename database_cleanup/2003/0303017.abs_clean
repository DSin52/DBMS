referencesWe calculate the symmetry currents for the type IIB superstring on amaximally supersymmetric plane wave background using the N=(2,2)superconformally covariant U(4) formulation developed by Berkovits, Maldacenaand Maoz. An explicit realization of the U(4) generators together with 16fermionic generators is obtained in terms of the N=(2,2) worldsheet fields.Because the action is no longer quadratic, we use a light-cone version todisplay the currents in terms of the covariant worldsheet variables.
