Comments: 9 pages

We analyse the physical boundary conditions at infinity for metricfluctuations and gauge functions in the RS2 model with matter on the brane. Weargue that due to these boundary conditions the radion field cannot be gaugedout in this case. Thus, it represents a physical degree of freedom of themodel.
