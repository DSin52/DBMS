We consider a spherical thick 3-brane immersed in a five-dimensional bulkspacetime. We demonstrate how the thick brane equation of motion expanded inpowers of the thickness of the brane can be obtained from the expected junctionconditions on the boundaries of thick brane with the two embedding spacetimes.It is shown that the finite thickness leads to a faster collapse of thespherical shell.
