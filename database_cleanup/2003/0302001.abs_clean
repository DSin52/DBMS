We calculate the D-instanton corrections (with all D-instanton numbers) tothe quantum moduli space metric of a single matter hypermultiplet with toricisometry, in the effective N=2 supergravity arising in type-IIA superstringscompactified on a Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold of Hodge number h_{2,1}=1. Thenon-perturbative quaternionic hypermultiplet metric is derived by resolution ofa complex orbifold singularity, thus generalizing the known (Ooguri-Vafa)solution in flat spacetime to N=2 supergravity.
