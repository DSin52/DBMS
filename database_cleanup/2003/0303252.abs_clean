The decay constant of the QCD axion is required by observation to be smallcompared to the Planck scale. In theories of "natural inflation," and certainproposed anthropic solutions of the cosmological constant problem, it would beinteresting to obtain a large decay constant for axion-like fields frommicroscopic physics. String theory is the only context in which one cansensibly address this question. Here we survey a number of periodic fields instring theory in a variety of string vacua. In some examples, the decayconstant can be parameterically larger than the Planck scale but the effectiveaction then contains appreciable harmonics of order $f_A/M_p$. As a result,these fields are no better inflaton candidates than Planck scale axions.
