A simple model for the reheating of the universe after inflation is studiedin which an essentially inhomogeneous scalar field representing matter iscoupled to an essentially homogeneous scalar inflaton field. Through thiscoupling, the potential determining the evolution of the inflaton field is madetime-dependent. Due to this the frequency of parametric resonance becomes timedependent, making the reheating process especially effective. All fieldsincluding the gravitational field are initially simplified by expanding each interms of the respective homogeneity or inhomogeneity. Employing only the lowestorder of this expansion, we space-average, and introduce all independentaverages as new variables. This leads to a hierarchy of equations for thespatial moments of the fields and their derivatives. A small expansionparameter permits a truncation to lowest order, yielding a closed system of 5coupled nonlinear first order differential equations. For a parabolicpotential, the energy densities of the matter and inflaton fields oscillatechaotically around each other from the end of inflation until they reachextremely small values. The average period of preponderance of one of the twocontinuously increases in this process. We discuss that this may provide oneclue to a solution of the coincidence problem. For a Mexican hat potential wecan easily obtain and understand dynamical symmetry breaking.
