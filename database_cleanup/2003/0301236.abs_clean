Authors: N.T.Yilmaz

Comments: 22 pages

The dualised formulation of the symmetric space sigma model is peformed for ageneral scalar coset G/K where G is a maximally non-compact group and K it'smaximal compact subgroup.By using the twisted self-duality condition thegeneral form of the first-order equations are obtained.The results are appliedto the example of SL(2,R)/SO(2) scalar manifold of the IIB supergravity.
