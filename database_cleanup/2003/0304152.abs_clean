modified; a few references and an acknowledgement addedWe obtain the asymptotic density of open p-brane states with zero-modesincluded. The resulting logarithmic correction to the p-brane entropy has acoefficient - \frac{p + 2}{2 p}, and is independent of the dimension of theembedding spacetime. Such logarithmic corrections to the entropy, withmassless particles in p-dimensional space, and a Schwarzschild black hole in (p+ 2)-dimensional anti de Sitter spacetime.
