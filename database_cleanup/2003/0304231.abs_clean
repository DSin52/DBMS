We study the wave equation for a massive scalar field in three-dimensionalAdS (anti de Sitter) and dS (de Sitter) spaces to find what is the differenceand similarity between two spaces. Here the AdS space is provided by the BTZblack hole with J=0. To investigate its event (cosmological) horizons, wecompute the absorption cross section, quasinormal modes, and study theAdS(dS)/CFT correspondences. Although there remains an unclear point indefining the ingoing flux near infinity of the BTZ black hole, quasinormalmodes are obtained and the AdS/CFT correspondence is confirmed. However, we donot find quasinormal modes and thus do not confirm the assumed dS/CFTcorrespondence. This difference in the scalar wave propagation between AdS anddS spaces is very interesting, because their global structures are similar toeach other.
