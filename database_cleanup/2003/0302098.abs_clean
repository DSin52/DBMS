Title: The Yang Mills* Gravity Dual

Authors: David E. Crooks and Nick Evans

Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures

We describe a ten dimensional supergravity geometry which is dual to a gaugetheory that is non-supersymmetric Yang Mills in the infra-red but reverts to$N$=4 super Yang Mills in the ultra-violet. A brane probe of the geometry showsthat the scalar potential of the gauge theory is stable. We discuss theinfra-red behaviour of the solution. The geometry describes a Schroedingerequation potential that determines the glueball spectrum of the theory; thereis a mass gap and a discrete spectrum. The glueball mass predictions matchprevious AdS/CFT Correspondence computations in the non-supersymmetric YangMills theory, and lattice data, at the 10% level.
