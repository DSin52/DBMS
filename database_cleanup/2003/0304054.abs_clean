Title: Supergravity and IOSp(3,1|4) gauge theory

Authors: T. G. Philbin

Comments: 7 pages

Simple D=4 supergravity is obtained from the gauge theory of theinhomogeneous orthosymplectic group IOSp(3,1|4) on a (4,4)-dimensional basesupermanifold by imposing constraints and talking a limit. Both the constraintsand the limiting procedure have a clear a priori physical motivation. Theconstruction has similarities with the space-time formulation of Newtoniangravity.
