After recalling episodes from Pascual Jordan's biography including hispivotal role in the shaping of quantum field theory and his much criticizedconduct during the NS regime, I draw attention to his presentation of the firstphase of development of quantum field theory in a talk presented at the 1929Kharkov conference. He starts by giving a comprehensive account of thebeginnings of the new quantum theory and then passes to his recent discovery ofquantization of ``wave fields'' and problems of gauge invariance. The mostsurprising aspect of Jordan's presentation is however his strong belief thathis field quantization is a transitory not yet optimal formulation of theprinciples underlying causally localizable quantum physics. The expectation ofa future more radical change coming from the main architect of fieldquantization already shortly after his discovery is certainly quite startling.I try to answer the question to what extend Jordan's 1929 expectations havebeen vindicated. The larger part of the present essay consists in arguing thatJordan's plea for a formulation without ``classical correspondence crutches'',i.e. for an intrinsic approach without the classical parallelism calledquantization, is successfully addressed in past and recent publications onlocal quantum physics.
