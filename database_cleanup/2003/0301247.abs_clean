Authors: El Mostapha Sahraoui

Comments: 14 pages, 5 figures, jhep style

The baryon vertex of IIB superstring theory on $AdS_{5}\times\mathbb{R}P^{5}$, for the case of orthogonal groups, is studied. The energy ofthe three brane decayed from an original five brane is calculated explicitly.The radius of this decayed three brane, for a BPS configuration, is also givenand interpreted.
