We study partially supersymmetric plane-wave like deformations of stringtheories and M-theory on brane backgrounds. These deformations are dual tononlocal field theories. We calculate various expectation values ofconfigurations of closed as well as open Wilson loops and Wilson surfaces inthose theories. We also discuss the manifestation of the nonlocality structurein the supergravity backgrounds. A plane-wave like deformation of little stringtheory has also been studied.
