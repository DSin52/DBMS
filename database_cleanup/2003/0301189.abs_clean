added referenceWe consider warped compactifications that solve the 10 dimensionalsupergravity equations of motion at a point, stabilize the position of aD3-brane world, and admit a warp factor that violates Lorentz invariance alongthe brane. This gives a string embedding of ``asymmetrically warped'' modelswhich we use to calculate stringy (\alpha') corrections to standard modeldispersion relations, paying attention to the maximum speeds for differentparticles. We find, from the dispersion relations, limits on gravitationalLorentz violation in these models, improving on current limits on the speed ofgraviton propagation, including those derived from field theoretic loops. Wecomment on the viability of models that use asymmetric warping for self-tuningof the brane cosmological constant.
