Title: N=2 SYM Action as a BRST Exact Term, Topological Yang Mills and

InstantonsComments: Latex, 1+18 pages

By defining an extended BRST operator that includes the chiral part of N=2global supersymmetry, it is shown that the full N=2 off-shell Super Yang MillsAction can be represented as an exact BRST term. The action written in thisform suggests that the fields of the Topological Yang Mills theory can bedefined in terms of composite fields of supersymmetry ghosts and N=2 fields ina natural way. Topological Yang Mills theory is obtained from the ordinaryEuclidean N=2 SYM directly as field redefinitions without using twistingprocedure. With the help of these results, relation between the recentinstanton calculations in N=2 Super Yang Mills and Topological Yang Millstheories is also discussed.
