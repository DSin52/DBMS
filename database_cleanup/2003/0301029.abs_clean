Title: On Curvature-Squared Corrections for D-brane Actions

Authors: Martijn Wijnholt

Comments: 8 pages, 1 figure, harvmac

Curvature-squared corrections for D-brane actions in type II string theorywere derived by Bachas, Bain and Green. Here we write down a generalisation ofthese corrections to all orders in $F$, the field strength of the U(1) gaugefield on the brane. Some of these terms are needed to restore consistency withT-duality.
