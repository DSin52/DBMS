This review of bosonic string field theory is concentrated on two mainsubjects. In the first part we revisit the construction of the three stringvertex and rederive the relevant Neumann coefficients both for the matter andthe ghost part following a conformal field theory approach. We use thisformulation to solve the VSFT equation of motion for the ghost sector. Thispart of the paper is based on a new method which allows us to derive knownresults in a simpler way. In the second part we concentrate on the solution ofthe VSFT equation of motion for the matter part. We describe the constructionof the three strings vertex in the presence of a background B field. Wedetermine a large family of lump solutions, illustrate their interpretation asD-branes and study the low energy limit. We show that in this limit the lumpsolutions flow toward the so-called GMS solitons.
