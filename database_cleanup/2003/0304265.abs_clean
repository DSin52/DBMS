Title: Dirac's Footsteps and Supersymmetry

Authors: P. Ramond

Comments: Invited Talk at Dirac's Centennial Symposium, Tallahasse, Florida,

Dec 2002One hundred years after its creator's birth, the Dirac equation stands as thecornerstone of XXth Century physics. But it is much more, as it carries theseeds of supersymmetry. Dirac also invented the light-cone, or "front form"dynamics, which plays a crucial role in string theory and in elucidating thefiniteness of N=4 Yang-Mills theory. The light-cone structure ofeleven-dimensional supergravity (N=8 supergravity in four dimensions) suggestsa group-theoretical interpretation of its divergences. We speculate they couldbe compensated by an infinite number of triplets of massless higher spinfields, each obeying a Dirac-like equation associated with the coset$F_4/SO(9)$. The divergences are proportional to the trace over a non-compactstructure containing the compact form of $F_4$. Its nature is still unknown,but it could show the way to $M$-theory.
