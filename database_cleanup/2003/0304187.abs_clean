We discuss a model in which high energy brane corrections allow a singlescalar field to describe inflation at early epochs and quintessence at latetimes. The reheating mechanism in the model originates from Born-Infeld matterwhose energy density mimics cosmological constant at very early times andmanifests itself as radiation subsequently. For most of the inflationaryevolution the Born-Infeld matter remains subdominant to the the scalar field.Shortly before the end of inflation driven by the scalar field, the energydensity of Born-Infeld matter starts scaling as radiation and drops by severalorders of magnitudes at the epoch inflation ends. The problem of overproduction of gravity wave background in scenarios based upon reheating throughgravitational particle production is successfully resolved by suitably fixingthe initial value of radiation energy density at the end of inflation. Noadditional fine tuning of the parameters is required for a viable evolution.
