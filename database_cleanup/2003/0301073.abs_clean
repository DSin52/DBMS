Title: Holographic entropy bounds in the inflationary universe

Authors: Y.S. Myung

Comments: 16 pages, two eps figures

We introduce the relation between the holographic entropy bounds and theinflationary universe. First the holographic entropy bounds forradiation-dominated universe, radiation-dominated universe with a positivecosmological constant are introduced. For an exact de Sitter phase, we use themaximal entropy bound. We classify the inflation based on the quasi-de Sitterand radiation-dominated era. Then we study how to apply three entropy bounds tothe three steps of the inflation.Finally we discuss our results.
