Title: CP symmetry and the strong interactions

Authors: Michael Creutz

Comments: 14 pages, 2 figures, revtex

I discuss several aspects of CP non-invariance in the strongly interactingtheory of quarks and gluons. I use a simple effective Lagrangian technique tomap out the region of quark masses where CP symmetry is spontaneously broken. Ithen turn to the possible explicit CP violation arising from a complex quarkmass. After summarizing the definition of the renormalized theory as a limit, Iargue that attempts to remove the CP violation by making the lightest quarkmass vanish are not well defined. I close with some warnings for latticesimulations.
