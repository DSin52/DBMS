Title: Gauge Theories on the Light-Front

Authors: Stanley J. Brodsky (SLAC)

Comments: Invited talk presented at the XXIII Encontro Nacional de Fisica de

Particulas e Campos, (The XXIII National Meeting of Particles and Fields),Aguas se Lindoila, Sao Paulo, Brazil, 15-19 October 2002The light-front quantization of gauge theories in light-cone gauge provides aframe-independent wavefunction representation of relativistic bound states,simple forms for current matrix elements, explicit unitary, and a trivialvacuum. The light-front Hamiltonian form of QCD provides an alternative tolattice gauge theory for the computation of nonperturbative quantities such asthe hadronic spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions. In the case of theelectroweak theory, spontaneous symmetry breaking is represented by theappearance of zero modes of the Higgs field. Light-front quantization thenleads to an elegant ghost-free theory of massive gauge particles, automaticallyincorporating the Lorentz and 't Hooft conditions, as well as the Goldstoneboson equivalence theorem.
