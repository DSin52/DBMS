removed, references addedCalculations of the two-loop $\beta$-function for N=1 supersymmetricelectrodynamics are compared for regularizations by higher derivatives and bythe dimensional reduction. The renormalized effective action are found to bethe same for both regularizations. However, unlike the dimensional reduction,the higher derivative regularization does not lead to anomaly puzzle, becauseit allows to perform correct calculation of diagrams with insertions ofcounterterms. In particular, using this method a contribution of diagrams withinsertions of counterterms is calculated exactly to all orders. Thiscontribution appears to be 0 if the theory is regularized by the dimensionalreduction. We argue, that this result follows from mathematical inconsistencyof the dimensional reduction and is responsible for the anomaly puzzle.
