Nishinomiya Yukawa Memorial Symposium, Nishinomiya, November, 2002The issue of holographic principle in the PP-wave limit of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence is discussed, in the hope of clarifying some confusions in theliterature. We show that, in the plane-wave limit, the relation between thepartition function in the bulk and the gauge-invariant correlation functions onthe boundary should be interpreted on the basis of a tunneling picture in thesemi-classical approximation which is appropriate for the plane-wave limit.This leads to a natural relation between Euclidean S-matrix in the bulk and theshort-distance operator-product expansion of the so-called BMN operators on theboundary.
