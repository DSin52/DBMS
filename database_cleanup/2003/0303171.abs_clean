In certain Lorentz-covariant higher-derivative field theories of spins < or=1, would-be ultraviolet divergences generate color-singlet poles as infrareddivergences. Absence of higher-order poles implies ten-dimensionalsupersymmetric Yang-Mills with bound-state supergravity, in close analogy withopen string theory.
