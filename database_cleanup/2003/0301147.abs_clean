We demonstrate the existence of a class of N=1 supersymmetric nonperturbativevacua of Horava-Witten M-theory compactified on a torus fibered Calabi-Yau3-fold Z with first homotopy group \pi_{1}(Z)= Z2, having the followinggenerations of chiral fermions in the observable sector, and 3) potentiallyviable matter Yukawa couplings. These vacua correspond to semistableholomorphic vector bundles V_{Z} over Z having structure group SU(4)_C, andgenerically contain M5-branes in the bulk space. The nontrivial first homotopygroup allows Wilson line breaking of the SO(10) symmetry. Additionally, wepropose how the 11-dimensional Horava-Witten M-theory framework may be used toextend the perturbative calculation of the top quark Yukawa coupling in therealistic free-fermionic models to the nonperturbative regime. The basicargument being that the relevant coupling couples twisted-twisted-untwistedstates and can be calculated at the level of the Z2 X Z2 orbifold withoutresorting to the full three generation models.
