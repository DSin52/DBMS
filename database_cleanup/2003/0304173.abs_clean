Title: Gravitational Radiation from Travelling Waves on D-Strings

Authors: Julie D. Blum

Boundary states that preserve supersymmetry are constructed for fractionalD-strings with travelling waves on a ${\bf C}^3/ {{\bf Z}_2\times {\bf Z}_2}$orbifold. The gravitational radiation emitted between two D-strings withantiparallel travelling waves is calculated.
