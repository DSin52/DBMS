Title: Comments on Two-Loop Four-Particle Amplitude in Superstring Theory

Authors: Wu-Jun Bao, Chuan-Jie Zhu

Comments: 10 pages, Latex file

It is shown that the four-particle amplitude of superstring theory at twoloops obtained in [1,2] is equivalent to the previously obtained results in[3,4,5]. Here the ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetry in hyperelliptic Riemann surface playsan important role in the proof.
