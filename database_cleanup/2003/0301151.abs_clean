Stability of AdS space allows scalar fields to have negative mass squared aslong as the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound is satisfied. In a compactification ofAdS instead, to avoid instabilities, a tachyonic bulk mass must be supplementedby appropriate brane actions. In this paper we clarify the meaning of the lowerbound in the Randall-Sundrum scenario with two branes and explain how theinstability disappears in the infinite space limit. A CFT interpretation isalso given as radiative symmetry breaking.
