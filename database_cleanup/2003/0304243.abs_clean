A simple method for breaking gauge groups by orbifolding is presented. Weextend the method of Kac and Peterson to include Wilson lines. The completeclassification of the gauge group breaking, e.g. from heterotic string, is nowpossible. From this Dynkin diagram technique, one can easily visualize theorigin and the symmetry pattern of the surviving gauge group.
