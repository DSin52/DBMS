We consider the entropy bounds recently conjectured by Fischler, Susskind andBousso, and proven in certain cases by Flanagan, Marolf and Wald (FMW). One ofthe FMW derivations supposes a covariant form of the Bekenstein entropy bound,the consequences of which we explore. The derivation also suggests that theentropy contained in a vacuum spacetime, e.g. Schwarzschild, is related to theshear on congruences of null rays. We find evidence for this intuition, but ina surprising way. We compare the covariant entropy bound to certain earlierdiscussions of black hole entropy, and comment on the separate roles of quantummechanics and gravity in the entropy bound.
