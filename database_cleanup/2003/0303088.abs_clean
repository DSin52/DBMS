Title: Quantizing Dirac and Nambu Brackets

Authors: Thomas Curtright and Cosmas Zachos

Comments: Talk given by the first author at the Coral Gables Conference, 14

December 2002, Fort Lauderdale, FloridaWe relate classical and quantum Dirac and Nambu brackets. At the classicallevel, we use the relations between the two brackets to gain some insight intothe Jacobi identity for Dirac brackets, among other things. At the quantumlevel, we suggest that the Nambu bracket is the preferred method forintroducing constraints, although at the expense of some unorthodox behavior,which we describe in detail.
