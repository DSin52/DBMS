We propose TBA integral equations for multiparticle soliton (fermion) statesin the Sine-Gordon (massive Thirring) model. This is based on T-system andY-system equations, which follow from the Bethe Ansatz solution in thelight-cone lattice formulation of the model. Even and odd charge sectors aretreated on an equal footing, corresponding to periodic and twisted boundaryconditions, respectively. The analytic properties of the Y-system functions areconjectured on the basis of the large volume solution of the system, which wefind explicitly. A simple relation between the TBA Y-functions and the countingfunction variable of the alternative non-linear integral equation(Destri-deVega equation) description of the model is given. At the specialvalue $\beta^2=6\pi$ of the Sine-Gordon coupling exact expressions for energyand momentum eigenvalues of one-particle states are found.
