Title: Twisted Moduli Stabilization in Type I String Models

Authors: Tetsutaro Higaki and Tatsuo Kobayashi

Comments: 18 pages, latex, 3 figures

We consider the model with the dilaton and twisted moduli fields, which isinspired by type I string models. Stabilization of their vacuum expectationvalues is studied. We find the stabilization of the twisted moduli field hasdifferent aspects from the dilaton stabilization.
