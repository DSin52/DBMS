Authors: Kazuo Ghoroku, Akihiro Nakamura, Masanobu Yahiro

Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure, LaTeX

Newton potential has been evaluated for the case of dS brane embedded inMinkowski, dS$_5$ and AdS$_5$ bulks. We point out that only the AdS$_5$ bulkmight be consistent with the Newton's law from the brane-world viewpoint whenwe respect a small cosmological constant observed at present universe.
