We examine a tensionless limit of a SL(2,Z) set of background solutions toIIB supergravity theory, obtained by performing an infinite boost. This yieldsa solution that corresponds to taking the original string tension to zero. Thelimit reproduces ordinary Minkowski space except for a delta-like singularityalong the string. We study the field content and the energy momentum tensor.
