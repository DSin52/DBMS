We investigate the description of the region behind the event horizon inrotating black holes in the AdS/CFT correspondence, using the rotating BTZblack hole as a concrete example. We extend a technique introduced by Kraus,Ooguri and Shenker [hep-th/0212277], based on analytically continuingamplitudes defined in a Euclidean space, to include rotation. In the rotatingcase, boundary amplitudes again have two different bulk descriptions, involvingeither integration only over the regions outside the black holes' eventhorizon, or integration over this region and the region between the eventhorizon and the Cauchy horizon (inner horizon). We argue that generally, theholographic map will relate the field theory to the region bounded by theCauchy horizons in spacetime. We also argue that these results suggest that theholographic description of black holes will satisfy strong cosmic censorship.
