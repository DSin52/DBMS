We show that the supertube configurations exist in all supersymmetric typeIIA backgrounds which are purely geometrical and which have, at least, one flatdirection. In other words, they exist in any spacetime of the form R^{1,1} xM_8, with M_8 any of the usual reduced holonomy manifolds. These generalisedsupertubes preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetries preserved by the choice of themanifold M_8. We also support this picture with the construction of theircorresponding family of IIA supergravity backgrounds preserving from 1/4 to1/32 of the total supercharges.
