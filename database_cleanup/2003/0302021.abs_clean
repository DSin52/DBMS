We construct 7-dimensional compact Einstein spaces with conical singularitiesthat preserve 1/8 of the supersymmetries of M-theory. Mathematically they haveweak G_2-holonomy. We show that for every non-compact G_2-holonomy manifoldwhich is asymptotic to a cone on a 6-manifold Y, there is a corresponding weakG_2-manifold with two conical singularities which, close to the singularities,looks like a cone on Y. Our construction provides explicit metrics on theseweak G_2-manifolds. We completely determine the cohomology of these manifoldsin terms of the cohomology of Y.
