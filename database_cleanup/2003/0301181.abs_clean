Comments: 15 pages. contribution to the Ramanujan International Symposium on

Kac-Moody Lie algebras and Applications (Madras, January 28-31, 2002). Forrelated proceedings contributions seeAffine Kac-Moody algebras give rise to interesting systems of differentialequations, so-called Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. The monodromy propertiesof their solutions can be encoded in the structure of a modular tensor categoryon (a subcategory of) the representation category of the affine Lie algebra. Wediscuss the relation between these solutions and physical correlation functionsin two-dimensional conformal field theory. In particular we report on a prooffor the existence of the latter on world sheets of arbitrary topology.
