Title: Fermions coupled to Skyrmions on S^3

Authors: Steffen Krusch

Comments: 31 pages, 6 figures

This paper discusses Skyrmions on the 3-sphere coupled to fermions. Theresulting Dirac equation commutes with a generalized angular momentum G. For G= 0 the Dirac equation can be solved explicitly for a constant Skyrmeconfiguration and also for a SO(4) symmetric hedgehog configuration. We discusshow the spectrum changes due to the presence of a non-trivial winding number,and also consider more general Skyrme configurations numerically.
