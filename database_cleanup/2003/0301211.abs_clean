It is shown that the problem of the recursive restoration of theSlavnov-Taylor (ST) identities at the quantum level for anomaly-free gaugetheories is equivalent to the problem of parameterizing the local approximationto the quantum effective action in terms of ST functionals, associated with thecohomology classes of the classical linearized ST operator. The ST functionalsof dimension <=4 correspond to the invariant counterterms, those of dimension>4 generate the non-symmetric counterterms upon projection on the action-likesector. At orders higher than one in the loop expansion there are additionalcontributions to the non-invariant counterterms, arising from known lower orderterms. They can also be parameterized by using the ST functionals. We apply themethod to Yang-Mills theory with one family of chiral fermions in the Landaugauge and derive the most general solution for the action-like part of thequantum effective action, compatible with the fulfillment of the ST identitiesand of the other relevant symmetries of the model. The full dependence of thesolution on the normalization conditions is given.
