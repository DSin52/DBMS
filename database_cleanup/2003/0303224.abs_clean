Title: How to generate families of spinors

Authors: N. Mankoc Borstnik (Department of Physics, University of Ljubljana,

and Primorska Institute for Natural Sciences and Technology, Koper, Slovenia)and H. B. Nielsen (Department of Physics, Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen)Using the technique to construct a basis for spinors and families of spinorsin terms of Clifford algebra objects, we define other Clifford algebra objects,which transform a state of one ''family'' of spinors into a state of another''family'' of spinors, changing nothing but the ''family'' number. The proposedtransformation works - as does the technique - for all dimensions and anysignature, opening a way for understanding families of quarks and leptons.
