Quantum mechanical fluctuations in an interval give rise to the Casimireffect, which destabilizes the size of the interval. This can be problematic inconstructing Kaluza-Klein theories. We consider the possibility that abreakdown of the Poincar\'e symmetry in an extra dimension can solve thisinstability problem. As a specific example, we consider the space-time with a$\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e algebra, calculate the Casimir force between twoplates, and find that we can have an interval with a stable size.
