Title: A note on the triviality of kappa-deformations of gravity

Authors: D. Grumiller, W. Kummer and D.V. Vassilevich

Comments: 5 pages (twocolumn), proceedings contribution to the XIV Hutsulian

workshop on "Mathematical Theories and their Physical & Technicaladded references and clarifying remarksSome simple observations concerning certain kappa-deformations in theframework of 2D dilaton gravity formulated as Poisson-sigma models arediscussed, and the question of (non-)triviality is addressed.
