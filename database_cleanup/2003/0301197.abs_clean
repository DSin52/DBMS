We introduce a gauge invariant and string independent two-point fermioncorrelator which is analyzed in the context of the Schwinger model (QED_2). Wealso derive an effective infrared worldline action for this correlator, thusenabling the computation of its infrared behavior. Finally, we briefly discusspossible perspectives for the string independent correlator in the QED_3effective models for the normal state of HTc superconductors.
