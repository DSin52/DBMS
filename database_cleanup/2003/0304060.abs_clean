In this paper it is shown that the entropy of the black hole horizon in theAchucarro-Ortiz spacetime, which is the most general two-dimensional black holederived from the three-dimensional rotating BTZ black hole, can be described bythe Cardy-Verlinde formula. The latter is supposed to be an entropy formula ofconformal field theory in any dimension.
