It is well known that, due to vanishing theorems, there are no nontrivialfinite action solutions to the Abelian Seiberg-Witten (SW) monopole equationson Euclidean four-dimensional space R^4. We show that this is no longer truefor the noncommutative version of these equations, i.e. on a noncommutativedeformation R^4_\theta of R^4 there exist smooth solutions to the SW equationshaving nonzero topological charge. We introduce action functionals for thenoncommutative SW equations and construct explicit regular solutions. All oursolutions have finite energy. We also suggest a possible interpretation of theobtained solutions as codimension four vortex-like solitons representingD(p-4)- and anti-D(p-4)-branes in a Dp-anti-Dp brane system in type IIsuperstring theory.
