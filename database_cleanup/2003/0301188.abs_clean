Title: Interaction between vortices in models with two order parameters

The interaction energy and force between widely separated strings is analyzedin a field theory having applications to superconducting cosmic strings, theSO(5) model of high-temperature superconductivity, and solitons in nonlinearoptics. The field theory has two order parameters, one of which is broken inthe vacuum (giving rise to strings), the other of which is unbroken in thevacuum but which could nonetheless be broken in the core of the string. If thisdoes occur, there is an effect on the energetics of widely separated strings.This effect is important if the length scale of this second order parameter islonger than that of the other fields in the problem.
