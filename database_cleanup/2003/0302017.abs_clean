We consider a class of warped higher dimensional brane models with topology$M \times \Sigma \times S^1/Z_2$, where $\Sigma$ is a $D_2$ dimensionalmanifold. Two branes of codimension one are embedded in such a bulk space-timeand sit at the orbifold fixed points. We concentrate on the case where anexponential warp factor (depending on the distance along the orbifold)accompanies the Minkowski $M$ and the internal space $\Sigma$ line elements. Weevaluate the moduli effective potential induced by bulk scalar fields in thesemodels, and we show that generically this can stabilize the size of the extradimensions. As an application, we consider a scenario where supersymmetry isbroken not far below the cutoff scale, and the hierarchy between theelectroweak and the effective Planck scales is generated by a combination ofredshift and large volume effects. The latter is efficient due to the shrinkingof $\Sigma$ at the negative tension brane, where matter is placed. In thiscase, we find that the effective potential can stabilize the size of the extradimensions (and the hierarchy) without fine tuning provided that the internalspace $\Sigma$ is flat.
