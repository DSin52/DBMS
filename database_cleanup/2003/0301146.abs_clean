Chern--Simons type Lagrangians in $d=3$ dimensions are analyzed from thepoint of view of their covariance and globality. We use the transgressionformula to find out a new fully covariant and global Lagrangian forbimetric (or biconnection) structure. Such a formulation allows to calculatefrom a global and simpler viewpoint the energy-momentum complex and thesuperpotential both for Yang--Mills and gravitational examples.
