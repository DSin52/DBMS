Title: Superfield T-duality rules

Authors: Igor A. Bandos, Bernard Julia

Comments: 24 pages, latex, no figures

A geometric treatment of T-duality as an operation which acts on differentialforms in superspace allows us to derive the complete set of T-dualitytransformation rules which relate the superfield potentials of D=10 type IIAsupergravity with those of type IIB supergravity including Ramond-Ramondsuperfield potentials and fermionic supervielbeins. We show that these rulesare consistent with the superspace supergravity constraints.
