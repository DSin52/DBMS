In this paper, we study the cosmological evolution of imaginary configurationfor scalar fields with an O(\textit{N}) symmetry and discuss that it ispossible to realize the equation-of-state parameter $w<-1$. We show that theintroduction of negative kinetic energy of scalar fields could be equivalentlyrealized by a vector anti-unitary representation of the O(\textit{N}) group.When the fields are constrained with an O(\textit{N}) symmetry, they are morestable than that without symmetry. In the exponential potential, theO(\textit{N}) phantom field imposes a lower bound for the equation of state$w>-2$. We also derive the relations between the potential of the field and thered-shift, known as reconstruction equations.
