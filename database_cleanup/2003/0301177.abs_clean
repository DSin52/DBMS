It is argued that a phenomenologically viable grand unification model fromsuperstring is $SU(3)^3$, the simplest gauge group among the grand unificationsof the electroweak hypercharge embedded in semi-simple groups. We construct arealistic 4D $SU(3)^3$ model with the GUT scale $\sin^2\theta_W^0= \frac38$ ina $Z_3$ orbifold with Wilson line(s). By two GUT scale vacuum expectationvalues, we obtain a rank 4 supersymmetric standard model below the GUT scale,and predict three more strange families.
