Title: Kaluza-Klein Monopole in AdS Spacetime

Authors: Vakif K. Onemli and Bayram Tekin

Comments: 12 pages

We construct analogs of the flat space Kaluza-Klein monopoles in locallyAnti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces for D = 6. We show that unlike the flat space KKmonopole, there are no five dimensional static KK monopoles in AdS space. Thus,one needs at least two extra dimensions, one of which is compact, to get astatic KK monopole for cosmological backgrounds.
