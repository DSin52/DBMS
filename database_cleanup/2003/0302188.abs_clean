Title: The Proof that the Standard Transformations of E and B and the Maxwell

Equations with E and B are not Relativistically CorrectAuthors: Tomislav Ivezic

Comments: 4 pages, the reference [11] is added and [4] and [9]are corrected, a

sentence about the physical definitions of E^a and B^a is added on p.3In this paper it is exactly proved that the standard transformations of thethree-dimensional (3D) vectors of the electric and magnetic fields E and B arenot relativistically correct transformations. Thence the 3D vectors E and B arenot well-defined quantities in the 4D spacetime and, contrary to the generalbelief, the usual Maxwell equations with the 3D E and B are not in agreementwith the special relativity. The 4-vectors E^a and B^a, as well-defined 4Dquantities, are introduced instead of ill-defined 3D E and B. The proof isgiven in the tensor and the Clifford algebra formalisms.
