Winter School "Mathematical Methods in Physics", August 25-30, 2002,The quantization of a scalar field in AdS leads to two kinds of normalizablemodes, usually called regular and irregular modes. The regular one is easilytaken into account in the standard prescription for the AdS/CFT correspondence.The irregular mode requires a modified prescription which we argue is notcompletely satisfactory. We discuss an alternative quantization in AdS whichincorporates boundary terms in a natural way. Within this quantization schemewe present an improved prescription for the AdS/CFT correspondence which can beapplied to both, regular and irregular modes. Boundary conditions other thanDirichlet are naturally treated in this new improved setting.
