Title: Exceptional Groups and Physics

Authors: Pierre Ramond

Comments: Plenary Talk delivered at Groupe 24 Conference, Paris, July 2002

Quarks and leptons charges and interactions are derived from gauge theoriesassociated with symmetries. Their space-time labels come from representationsof the non-compact algebra of Special Relativity. Common to these descriptionsare the Lie groups stemming from their invariances. Does Nature use ExceptionalGroups, the most distinctive among them? We examine the case for and againsttheir use. They do indeed appear in charge space, as the Standard Model fitsnaturally inside the exceptional group $E_6$. Further, the advent of the$E_8\times E_8$ Heterotic Superstring theory adds credibility to this venue. Onthe other hand, their use as space-time labels has not been as evident as theylink spinors and tensors under space rotations, which flies in the face of thespin-statistics connection. We discuss a way to circumvent this difficulty intrying to generalize eleven-dimensional supergravity.
