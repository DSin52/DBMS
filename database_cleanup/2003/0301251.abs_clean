Title: On the SuperConformal Quantum Mechanics in the Nonlinear Realizations

ApproachAuthors: V.P. Akulov, Oktay Cebecioglu and A. Pashnev

In the framework of nonlinear realizations we rederive the action of the N=2SuperConformal Quantum Mechanics (SCQM). We propose also the WZNW -- likeconstruction of the interaction term in the lagrangian with the help ofCartan's Omega forms.
