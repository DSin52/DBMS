We consider multidimensional gravitational models with a nonlinear scalarcurvature term and form fields in the action functional. In our scenario it isassumed that the higher dimensional spacetime undergoes a spontaneouscompactification to a warped product manifold. Particular attention is paid tomodels with quadratic scalar curvature terms and a Freund-Rubin-like ansatz forsolitonic form fields. It is shown that for certain parameter ranges the extradimensions are stabilized. In particular, stabilization is possible for anysign of the internal space curvature, the bulk cosmological constant and of theeffective four-dimensional cosmological constant. Moreover, the effectivecosmological constant can satisfy the observable limit on the dark energydensity. Finally, we discuss the restrictions on the parameters of theconsidered nonlinear models and how they follow from the connection between theD-dimensional and the four-dimensional fundamental mass scales.
