Title: Perturbative Evaluation of Interacting Scalar Fields on a Curved

Manifold with BoundaryAuthors: George Tsoupros

Comments: 25 pages, 1 figure. Minor elucidations in the Appendix regarding the

cut-off $ N_0$ and in p.4 regarding the gravitational action. Certainreference-related ommission corrected. To appear in Classical and QuantumGravityThe effects of quantum corrections to a conformally invariant scalar fieldtheory on a curved manifold of positive constant curvature with boundary areconsidered in the context of a renormalisation procedure. The renormalisationof the theory to second order in the scalar self-coupling pursued hereininvolves explicit calculations of up to third loop-order and reveals that, inaddition to the renormalisation of the scalar self-coupling and scalar field,the removal of all divergences necessitates the introduction of conformallynon-invariant counterterms proportional to $ R\Phi^2$ and $ K\Phi^2$ in thebare scalar action as well as counterterms proportional to $ RK^2$, $ R^2$ and$ RK$ in the gravitational action. The substantial backreaction effects andtheir relevance to the renormalisation procedure are analysed.
