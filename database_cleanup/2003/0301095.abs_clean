Title: Intersection Rules for S-Branes

Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta

Comments: 11 pages, v2

corrected, to appear in PLBWe give a model-independent derivation of general intersecting rules forspacelike branes (S-branes) in arbitrary dimensions $d$. This is achieved bydirectly solving bosonic field equations for supergravity coupled to a dilatonand antisymmetric tensor fields with minimal ans\"{a}tze. We compare theresults with those in eleven-dimensional supergravity and other solutions.
