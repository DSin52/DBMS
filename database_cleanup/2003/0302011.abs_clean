We show how the full holomorphic geometry of local Calabi-Yau threefoldcompactifications with N=1 supersymmetry can be obtained from matrix models. Inparticular for the conifold geometry we relate F-terms to the generalamplitudes of c=1 non-critical bosonic string theory, and express them in aquiver or, equivalently, super matrix model. Moreover we relate, bydeconstruction, the uncompactified c=1 theory to the six-dimensional conformal(2,0) theory. Furthermore, we show how we can use the idea of deconstruction toconnect 4+k dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories to a k-dimensionalinternal bosonic gauge theory, generalizing the relation between 4d theoriesand matrix models. Examples of such bosonic systems include unitary matrixmodels and gauged matrix quantum mechanics, which deconstruct 5-dimensionalsupersymmetric gauge theories, and Chern-Simons gauge theories, whichdeconstruct gauge theories living on branes wrapped over cycles in Calabi-Yauthreefolds.
