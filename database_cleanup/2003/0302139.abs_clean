Comments: 45 pages, Latex

Quaternionic formulation of D=4 conformal group and of its associatedtwistors and their relation to harmonic analyticity is presented.Generalization of $SL(2,\cal{C})$ to the D=4 conformal group SO(5,1) and itscovering group $SL(2,\cal{Q})$ that generalizes the euclidean Lorentz group in$R^4$ [namely $SO(3,1)\approx SL(2,\cal{C})$ which allow us to obtain theprojective twistor space $CP^3$] is shown. Quasi-conformal fields areintroduced in D=4 and Fueter mappings are shown to map self-dual sector ontoitself (and similarly for the anti-self-dual part). Differentiation of Fueterseries and various forms of differential operators are shown, establishing theequivalence of Fueter analyticity with twistor and harmonic analyticity. Abrief discussion of possible octonion analyticity is provided.
