As was shown by Aharony, Hanany and Kol and independently by Sen, type IIBstring theory admits configurations where strings of different charges (p_i,q_i) form so-called string networks. We argue that these networks blow up intoand magnetic fluxes. These supersheets are three-dimensional generalizations ofthe supertubes that were constructed by Mateos and Townsend. We calculate themass of both systems for arbitrary values of the parameters and find exactagreement.
