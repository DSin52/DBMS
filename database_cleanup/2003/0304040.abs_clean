Continuing on our previous work, we consider a class of higher dimensionalbrane models with the topology of $AdS_{D_1+1} \times \Sigma$, where $\Sigma$is a one-parameter compact manifold and two branes of codimension 1 are locatedat the orbifold fixed points. We consider a set-up where such a solution arisesfrom Einstein-Yang-Mills theory and evaluate the one-loop effective potentialinduced by gauge fields and by a generic bulk scalar field. We show that thistype of brane models resolves the gauge hierarchy between the Planck andelectroweak scales through redshift effects due to the warp factor $a=e^{-\pikr}$. The value of $a$ is then fixed by minimizing the effective potential. Wefind that, as in the Randall Sundrum case, the gauge field contribution to theeffective potential stabilises the hierarchy without fine-tuning as long as thelaplacian $\Delta_\Sigma$ on $\Sigma$ has a zero eigenvalue. Scalar fields canstabilise the hierarchy depending on the mass and the non-minimal coupling. Wealso address the quantum self-consistency of the solution, showing that theclassical brane solution is not spoiled by quantum effects.
