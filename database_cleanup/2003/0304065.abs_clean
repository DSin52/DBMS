Gauge fields are special in the sense that they are invariant under gaugetransformations and \emph{``ipso facto''} they lead to problems when we tryquantizing them straightforwardly. To circumvent this problem we need tospecify a gauge condition to fix the gauge so that the fields that areconnected by gauge invariance are not overcounted in the process ofquantization. The usual way we do this in the light-front is through theintroduction of a Lagrange multiplier, $(n\cdot A)^{2}$, where $n_{\mu}$ is theexternal light-like vector, i.e., $n^{2}=0$, and $A_{\mu}$ is the vectorpotential. This leads to the usual light-front propagator with all the ensuingcharacteristics such as the prominent $(k\cdot n)^{-1}$ pole which has been thesubject of much research. However, it has been for long recognized that thisprocedure is incomplete in that there remains a residual gauge freedom still tobe fixed by some ``ad hoc'' prescription, and this is normally worked out toremedy some unwieldy aspect that emerges along the way. In this work we propose\emph{two} Lagrange multipliers with distinct coefficients for the light-frontgauge that leads to the correctly defined propagator with no residual gaugefreedom left. This is accomplished via $(n\cdot A)^2+(\partial \cdot A)^2$terms in the Lagrangian density. These lead to a well-defined and exact thoughLorentz non invariant propagator.
