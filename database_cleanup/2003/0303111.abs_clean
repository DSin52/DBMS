We show how Moore's observation, in the context of toroidal compactificationsin type IIB string theory, concerning the complex multiplication structure ofblack hole attractor varieties, can be generalized to Calabi-Yaucompactifications with finite fundamental groups. This generalization leads toan alternative general framework in terms of motives associated to a Calabi-Yauvariety in which it is possible to address the arithmetic nature of theattractor varieties in a universal way via Deligne's period conjecture.
