Title: Cosmic Attractors and Gauge Hierarchy

Authors: Gia Dvali, Alexander Vilenkin

We suggest a new cosmological scenario which naturally guarantees thesmallness of scalar masses and VEVs, without invoking supersymmetry or anyother (non-gravitationaly coupled) new physics at low energies. In ourframework, the scalar masses undergo discrete jumps due to nucleation of closedbranes during (eternal) inflation. The crucial point is that the step size ofvariation decreases in the direction of decreasing scalar mass. This scenarioyields exponentially large domains with a distribution of scalar masses, whichis sharply peaked around a hierarchically small value of the mass. This valueis the "attractor point" of the cosmological evolution.
