A QED-based mechanism, breaking translational invariance of the vacuum atsufficiently small distance scales, is suggested as an explanation for thevacuum energy pressure that accelerates the universe. Very-small-scale virtualvacuum currents are assumed to generate small-scale electromagnetic fieldscorresponding to the appearance of a 4-potential $A_{\mu}^{ext} (x)$, which isitself equal to the vev of the operator $ A_{\mu}(x)$ in the presence of that$A_{\mu}^{ext}(x)$. The latter condition generates a bootstrap-like equationfor $A_{\mu}^{ext}(x)$ which has an approximate, tachyonic-like solutioncorresponding to propagation outside the light cone, and damping inside; thissolution is given in terms of a mass parameter M that turns out to be on theorder of the Planck mass if only the simplest, electron vacuum-bubble isincluded; if the muon and tau bubbles are included, M decreases to $\sim 10^6 -10^7$ GeV. A multiplicative 4-vector $v_{\mu}$, whose magnitude is determinedby a comparison with the average mass density needed to produce the observedacceleration is introduced, and characterizes the distance d over which thefields so produced may be expected to be coherent; the present analysissuggests that d can lie anywhere in the range from $10^{-5} cm$ (correspondingto a "spontaneous vacuum phase change") to $10^{-13}cm$ (representing a"polarization of the QED vacuum" by quark-antiquark pairs of the QCD vacuum).Near the light-cone, such electric fields become large, introducing thepossibility of copious charged-particle pair production, whoseback-reaction-fields tend to diminish the vacuum electric field. Thepossibility of an experimental test of the resulting plasma at large momentumtransfers is discussed.
