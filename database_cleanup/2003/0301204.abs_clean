Title: String theory in Lorentz-invariant light cone gauge - II

Authors: Igor Nikitin, Lialia Nikitina

We perform a quantization of 4-dimensional Nambu-Goto theory of open stringin light cone gauge, related in Lorentz-invariant way with the world sheet.This allows to obtain a quantum theory without anomalies in Lorentz group. Weconsider a special type of gauge fixing conditions, imposed in oscillatorsector of the theory, which lead to a relatively simple Hamiltonian mechanics,convenient for canonical quantization. We discuss the algebraic and geometricproperties of this mechanics and determine its mass spectrum for the states ofspin singlet S=0.
