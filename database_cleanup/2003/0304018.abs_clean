Title: K-Theory from a physical perspective

Authors: Gregory Moore

Comments: 43 pp., harvmac b-mode. 12 figures

This is an expository paper which aims at explaining a physical point of viewon the K-theoretic classification of D-branes. We combine ideas ofrenormalization group flows between boundary conformal field theories, togetherwith spacetime notions such as anomaly cancellation and D-brane instantoneffects. We illustrate this point of view by describing the twisted K-theory ofthe special unitary groups SU(N).
