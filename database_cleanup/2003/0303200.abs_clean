Title: Comments on BPS Bound State Decay

Authors: Anatoly Dymarsky and Dmitry Melnikov

Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures

In N=2 SYM theory with matter non-conservation of the S-charge of a BPS stateunder monodromies leads to so-called BPS state "decay". A mechanism for such abehavior on the semiclassical level could be established through considerationof soliton-fermion bound state. Solutions to classical equations of motionallow to observe the BPS state "decay" in vivo.
