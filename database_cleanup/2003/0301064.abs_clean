Title: SLE martingales and the Virasoro algebra

Authors: Michel Bauer and Denis Bernard

Comments: 13 pages, to appear in Phys. Lett. B

TheoryWe present an explicit relation between representations of the Virasoroalgebra and polynomial martingales in stochastic Loewner evolutions (SLE). Weshow that the Virasoro algebra is the spectrum generating algebra of SLEmartingales. This is based on a new representation of the Virasoro algebra,inspired by the Borel-Weil construction, acting on functions depending oncoordinates parametrizing conformal maps.
