Title: Vacuum stress around a topological defect

Authors: V. A. De Lorenci and E. S. Moreira Jr. (UNIFEI-Itajuba')

Comments: 3 pages, 1 figure

We show that a dispiration (a disclination plus a screw dislocation)polarizes the vacuum of a scalar field giving rise to an energy momentum tensorwhich, as seen from a local inertial frame, presents non vanishing off-diagonalcomponents. Such a new effect resembles that where an induced vacuum currentarises around a needle solenoid carrying a magnetic flux (the Aharonov-Bohmeffect). The results may have applications in cosmology (chiral cosmic strings)and condensed matter physics (materials with linear defects).
