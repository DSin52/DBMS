Title: Yang's Quantized Space-time Algebra and Holographic Hypothesis

Authors: Sho Tanaka

The present-day significance of Yang's quantized space-time algebra (YST) ispointed out from the holographic viewpoint. One finds that the D-dimensionalYST and its modified version (MYST) have the background symmetry SO(D+1,1) andSO(D,2), which are well known to underlie the dS/CFT and AdS/CFTcorrespondences, respectively. This fact suggests a new possibility of dS/YSTand AdS/MYST in parallel with dS/CFT and AdS/CFT, respectively. The spatialcomponents of quantized space-time and momentum operators of YST have discreteeigenvalues and their respective minimums, $a$ and 1/R, without contradictionto Lorentz-covariance. With respect to MYST, the spatial components ofspace-time operators and the time component (energy) of momentum operators havediscrete eigenvalues and their respective minimums, $a$ and 1/R, in contrast toYST. This discrete structure of YST and MYST, which CFT lacks entirely, mayprovide a theoretical ground for the unified regularization or cutoff ofultraviolet and infrared divergences familiar in the UV/IR connection in theholographic hypothesis.
