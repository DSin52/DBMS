Title: Quantum Extended Supersymmetries

Authors: Dan Radu Grigore, Gunter Scharf

Comments: 28 pages, LATEX 2e

We analyse some quantum multiplets associated with extended supersymmetries.We study in detail the general form of the causal (anti)commutation relations.The condition of positivity of the scalar product imposes severe restrictionson the (quantum) model. It is problematic if one can find out quantumextensions of the standard model with extended supersymmetries.
