We calculate the one-loop corrections to gauge couplings in N=1supersymmetric brane world models, which are realized in an type IIAorbifold/orientifold background with several stacks of D6 branes wrapped on3-cycles with non-vanishing intersections. Contributions arise from both N=1and N=2 open string subsectors. In contrast to what is known from ordinaryorbifold theories, N=1 subsectors give rise to moduli-dependent one-loopcorrections.
