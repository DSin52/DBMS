Time-reversal symmetric examples ruled out,new examples are providedS(pacelike)D-branes are objects arising naturally in string theory whenDirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the time direction. SD-branephysics is inherently time-dependent. Previous investigations of gravity fieldsof SD-branes have yielded undesirable naked spacelike singularities. We set upthe problem of coupling the most relevant open-string tachyonic mode tomassless closed-string modes in the bulk, with backreaction and Ramond-Ramondfields included. We find solutions numerically in a self-consistentapproximation; our solutions are naturally asymptotically flat andtime-reversal asymmetric. We find completely nonsingular evolution; inparticular, the dilaton and curvature are well-behaved for all time. Theessential mechanism for spacetime singularity resolution is the inclusion offull backreaction between the bulk fields and the rolling tachyon. Our analysisis not the final word on the story, because we have to make some significantapproximations, most notably homogeneity of the tachyon on the unstable branes.Nonetheless, we provide significant progress in plugging a gaping hole in priorunderstanding of the gravity fields of SD-branes.
