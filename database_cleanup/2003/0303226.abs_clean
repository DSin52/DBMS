Title: Fermion propagator for QED_3 in the IR domain

Authors: C.D. Fosco, A. Lopez

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX; typo corrected in Eq.37

We evaluate the fermion propagator in parity-conserving QED_3 with Nflavours, in the context of an IR domain approximation. This provides resultswhich are non-perturbative in the loopwise expansion sense. We includefermion-loop effects, and show that they are relevant to the chiral symmetrybreaking phenomenon, that can be understood in this context.
