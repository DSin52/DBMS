paper (including all PS fonts) atWe present a method for evaluating divergent non-Borel-summable series by ananalytic continuation of variational perturbation theory. We demonstrate thepower of the method by an application to the exactly known partition functionof the anharmonic oscillator in zero spacetime dimensions. In one spacetimedimension we derive the imaginary part of the ground state energy of theanharmonic oscillator for {\em all negative values of the coupling constant$g$, including the nonanalytic tunneling regime at small-$g$. As a highlight ofthe theory we retrieve from the divergent perturbation expansion the action ofthe critical bubble and the contribution of the higher loop fluctuations aroundthe bubble.
