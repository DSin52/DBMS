4D Einstein gravity coupled to scalars and abelian gauge fields in its2-Killing vector reduction is shown to be quasi-renormalizable to all looporders at the expense of introducing infinitely many essential couplings. Thelatter can be combined into one or two functions of the `area radius'associated with the two Killing vectors. The renormalization flow of thesecouplings is governed by beta functionals expressible in closed form in termsof the (one coupling) beta function of a symmetric space sigma-model.Generically the matter coupled systems are asymptotically safe, that is theflow possesses a non-trivial UV stable fixed point at which the trace anomalyvanishes. The main exception is a minimal coupling of 4D Einstein gravity tomassless free scalars, in which case the scalars decouple from gravity at thefixed point.
