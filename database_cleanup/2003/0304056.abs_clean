From the viewpoint of the singular quantum mechanics the effect of theenergy-dependent coupling constant for $\delta$-function potential is examined.The energy-dependence of the coupling constant naturally generates thetime-derivative in the boundary condition of the Euclidean propagator. This isexplicitly confirmed by making use of the simple 1d model. The result isapplied to the linearized gravity fluctuation equation for the brane-worldscenario with 4d induced gravity. Our approach generates $5d$ Newton potentialat a certain intermediate range of distance between two test massive sources.For other range of distance 4d Newton potential is recovered.
