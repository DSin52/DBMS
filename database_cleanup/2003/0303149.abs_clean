Title: On the relation between quantum Liouville theory and the quantized

Teichm"uller spacesAuthors: J. Teschner

Comments: Contribution to the proceedings of the 6th International Conference

Typos corrected, typographical changesWe review both the construction of conformal blocks in quantum Liouvilletheory and the quantization of Teichm\"uller spaces as developed by Kashaev,Checkov and Fock. In both cases one assigns to a Riemann surface a Hilbertspace acted on by a representation of the mapping class group. According to aconjecture of H. Verlinde, the two are equivalent. We describe some key stepsin the verification of this conjecture.
