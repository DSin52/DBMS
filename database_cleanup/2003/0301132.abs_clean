Charged particles in static electric and magnetic fields have Landau levelsand, in the Coulomb gauge, tunneling states from vacuum. Using the instantonmethod of Phys. Rev. D 65, 105002 (2002), we obtain new formulae for thepair-production rate in spinor and scalar QED, which sum over all Landaulevels. The new formulae not only recover exactly the well-known results butalso give rise to other expressions more rapidly converging in the strongelectric field limit.
