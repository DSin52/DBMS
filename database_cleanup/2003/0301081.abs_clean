Comments: 10 pages, incl. 1 table

We develop a perturbative approach to the solution of the scalar waveequation for a large AdS black hole. In three dimensions, our method coincideswith the known exact solution. We discuss the five-dimensional case in detailand apply our procedure to the Heun equation. We calculate the quasi-normalmodes analytically and obtain good agreement with numerical results for thelow-lying frequencies.
