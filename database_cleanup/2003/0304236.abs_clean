In this paper we obtain strings that propagate in the quantized pp-wavebackgrounds. We can obtain these strings from the solutions of membrane. Theother way is the propagation of a massless string in a spacetime with two timedimensions. This string sweeps a worldvolume, which enables us to obtain otherstrings in the quantized pp-wave backgrounds in the spacetime with one timedirection. The associated algebras and Hamiltonians of these massive stringswill be studied.
