Title: Exact Solutions in SFT and Marginal Deformation in BCFT

Authors: J. Kluson

Comments: 15 pages

In this note we will study solution of open bosonic string field theory basedon action of operators from chiral algebra of boundary conformal field theoryon identity element of string field theory star algebra. We will demonstratethat the string field theory action for fluctuation fields around thisclassical solution can be mapped to the string field theory action definedthrough the new boundary conformal field theory that arises from the originalone through the marginal deformation inserted on the world-sheet boundary.
