Title: Electric/magnetic flux tube on the background of magnetic/electric field

It is argued that the phenomenon of a flux tube in quantum chromodynamics isclosely connected with a spontaneously symmetry breakdown of gauge theory. Itis shown that in the presence of a mass term in the SU(2) gauge theory theNielsen-Olesen equations describe the flux tube surrounded by an externalfield.
