We study gravitational corrections to the effective superpotential intheories with a single adjoint chiral multiplet, using the generalized Konishianomaly and the gravitationally deformed chiral ring. We show that the genusone correction to the loop equation in the corresponding matrix model agreeswith the gravitational corrected anomaly equations in the gauge theory. Animportant ingrediant in the proof is the lack of factorization of chiral gaugeinvariant operators in presence of a supergravity background. We also find agenus zero gravitational correction to the superpotential, which can be removedby a field redefinition.
