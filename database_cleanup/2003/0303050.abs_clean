Title: Generalized pp-wave solutions on product of Ricci-flat spaces

Comments: 18 pages, Latex, no figures

A multidimensional gravitational model with several scalar fields and fieldsof forms is considered. A wide class of generalized pp-wave solutions definedon a product of n+1 Ricci-flat spaces is obtained. Certain examples ofsolutions (e.g. in supergravitational theories) are singled out. For specialcone-type internal factor spaces the solutions are written in Brinkmann form.An example of pp-wave solution is obtained using Penrose limit of a solutiondefined on product of two Einstein spaces.
