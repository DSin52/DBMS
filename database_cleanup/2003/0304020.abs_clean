We study various $Sp(2M)$ invariant field equations corresponding to rank $r$tensor products of the Fock (singleton) representation of $Sp(2M)$.Theseequations are shown to describe localization on ``branes'' of differentdimensions embedded into the generalized space-time $\M_M$ with matrix (i.e.,``central charge'') coordinates. The case of bilinear tensor product isconsidered in detail. The conserved currents built from bilinears of rank 1fields in $\M_M$ are shown to satisfy the field equations of the rank 2 fieldsin $\M_M$. Also, the rank 2 fields in $\M_M$ are shown to be equivalent to therank 1 fields in $\M_{2M}$.
