Title: Effective theory for wall-antiwall system

Comments: LaTeX file, 30 page, 5 eps figures

We propose a useful method for deriving the effective theory for a systemwhere BPS and anti-BPS domain walls coexist. Our method respects anapproximately preserved SUSY near each wall. Due to the finite width of thewalls, SUSY breaking terms arise at tree-level, which are exponentiallysuppressed. A practical approximation using the BPS wall solutions is alsodiscussed. We show that a tachyonic mode appears in the matter sector if thecorresponding mode function has a broader profile than the wall width.
