Title: Fused integrable lattice models with quantum impurities and open

boundariesComments: 21 pages, LATEX

The alternating integrable spin chain and the $RSOS(q_{1},q_{2};p)$ model inthe presence of a quantum impurity are investigated. The boundary free energydue to the impurity is derived, the ratios of the corresponding $g$ functionsat low and high temperature are specified and their relevance to boundary flowsin unitary minimal and generalized coset models is discussed. Finally, thealternating spin chain with diagonal and non--diagonal integrable boundaries isstudied, and the corresponding boundary free energy and $g$ functions arederived.
