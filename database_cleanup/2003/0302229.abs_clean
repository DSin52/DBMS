Title: Fermion production in time-dependent fields

Authors: Dennis D. Dietrich

Comments: 27 pages, 4 figures

The exact fermion propagator in a classical time-dependent gauge field isderived by solving the equation of motion for the Dirac Green's functions. Fromthe retarded propagator obtained in this way the momentum spectrum for theproduced fermion pairs is calculated. Different approximations and the exactsolution for the propagator and the momentum spectrum are presented.
