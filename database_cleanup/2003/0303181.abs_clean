Title: Gap Condition and Self-Dualized ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills Theory for

ADE Gauge Group on K3Authors: Toru Sasaki

Comments: 17 pages

We try to determine the partition function of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Millstheoy for ADE gauge group on K3 by self-dualizing our previous ADE partitionfunction. The resulting partition function satisfies gap condition.
