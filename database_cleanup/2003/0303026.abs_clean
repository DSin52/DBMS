Title: Duality between quark-quark and quark-antiquark pairing in 1+1

We identify a canonical transformation which maps the chiral Gross-Neveumodel onto a recently proposed Cooper pair model. Baryon number and axialcharge are interchanged. The same physics can be described either as chiralsymmetry breaking (quark-antiquark pairing) or as superconductivity(quark-quark pairing).
