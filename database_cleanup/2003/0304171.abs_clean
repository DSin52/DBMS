diagonalizationThe mechanism of recombination of intersecting D-branes is investigatedwithin the framework of effective tachyon field theory. We regard the branes asthe kink-type tachyon condensed states and use the effective two-tachyonLagrangian to study the off-diagonal fluctuations therein. It is seen thatthere is a tachyonic mode in the off-diagonal fluctuations, which signs theinstability of the intersecting D-branes. We diagonalize the two-by-twotachyonic matrix field and see that the corresponding eigenfunctions could beused to describe the new recombined branes. Our prescription can be extended todiscuss the general behavior of the recombination of intersection D-branes witharbitrary shapes. We present in detail the physical reasons behind themathematical process of diagonalizing the tachyonic matrix field.
