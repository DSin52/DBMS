M(atrix) theory in PP-wave background possesses a discrete set of classicalvacua, all of which preserves 16 supersymmetry and interpretable as collectionof giant gravitons. We find Euclidean instanton solutions that interpolatebetween them, and analyze their properties. Supersymmetry prevents directmixing between different vacua but still allows effect of instanton to show upin higher order effective interactions, such as analog of v^4 interaction offlat space effective theory. An explicit construction of zero modes isperformed, and Goldstone zero modes, bosonic and fermionic, are identified. Wefurther generalize this to massive M(atrix) theory that includes fundamentalhypermultiplets, corresponding to insertion of longitudinal fivebranes in thebackground. After a brief comparison to their counterpart in AdS\times S, weclose with a summary.
