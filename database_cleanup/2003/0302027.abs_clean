Title: AdS and pp-wave D-particle superalgebras

Authors: Machiko Hatsuda

Comments: 15 pages

We derive anticommutators of supercharges with a brane charge for aD-particle in AdS(2) x S(2) and pp-wave backgrounds. A coset GL(2|2)/(GL(1))^4and its Penrose limit are used with the supermatrix-valued coordinates for theAdS and the pp-wave spaces respectively. The brane charges have positiondependence, and can be absorbed into bosonic generators by shift of momentawhich results in closure of the superalgebras.
