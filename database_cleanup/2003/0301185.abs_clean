We construct a classical mechanics Hamiltonian which exhibits spontaneoussymmetry breaking akin the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, dimensionaltransmutation, and asymptotically free self-similarity congruent with thebeta-function of four dimensional Yang-Mills theory. Its classical equations ofmotion support stable periodic orbits and in a three dimensional projectionthese orbits are self-linked into topologically nontrivial, toroidal knots.
