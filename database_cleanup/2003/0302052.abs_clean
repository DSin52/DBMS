Title: Chronology Protection in String Theory

Authors: Lisa Dyson

Many solutions of General Relativity appear to allow the possibility of timetravel. This was initially a fascinating discovery, but geometries of this typeviolate causality, a basic physical law that is believed to be fundamental.Although string theory is a proposed fundamental theory of quantum gravity,geometries with closed time-like curves have resurfaced as solutions to its lowenergy equations of motion. In this work, we will study the class of solutionsto low energy effective supergravity theories related to the BMPV black holeand the rotating D1-D5-wave. Time travel appears to be possible in thesegeometries. We will attempt to build the causality violating regions andpropose that stringy effects prohibit their construction. The proposedchronology protection agent for these geometries mirrors a mechanism stringtheory employs to resolve a class of naked time-like singularities.
