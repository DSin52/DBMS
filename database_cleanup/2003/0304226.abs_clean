Title: Inflation from Tachyon Condensation, Large N Effects

Authors: Mahbub Majumdar and Anne-Christine Davis

Comments: 24 pages, 1 figure

Using only general properties of the tachyon potential we show that inflationmay be generic when many branes and anti-branes become coincident. Inflation(2) when the tachyons condense in a staggered fashion; or (3) when some of themcondense very late. We point out that such inflation is in some sense a stringyimplementation of chaotic inflation and may have important applications for``regularizing'' a lopsided or singular cosmological compact surface.
