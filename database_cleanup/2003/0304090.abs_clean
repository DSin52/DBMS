We apply the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism to the scalar $\lambda\phi^{4}$ theory in canonical-noncommutative spacetime. We construct the CJTeffective potential and the gap equation for general values of thenoncommutative parameter $\theta_{\mu\nu}$. We observe that under thehypothesis of translational invariance, which is assumed in the effectivepotential construction, differently from the commutative case($\theta_{\mu\nu}= 0$), the renormalizability of the gap equation isincompatible with the renormalizability of the effective potential. We arguethat our result, is consistent with previous studies suggesting that a uniformordered phase would be inconsistent with the infrared structure of canonicalnoncommutative theories.
