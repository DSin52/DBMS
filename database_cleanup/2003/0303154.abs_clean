We present a class of scalar field cosmologies with a dynamically evolvingNewton parameter $G$ and cosmological term $\Lambda$. In particular, we discussa class of solutions which are consistent with a renormalization group scalingfor $G$ and $\Lambda$ near a fixed point. Moreover, we propose a modifiedaction for gravity which includes the effective running of $G$ and $\Lambda$near the fixed point.
