tunnelingWe outline the construction of metastable de Sitter vacua of type IIB stringtheory. Our starting point is highly warped IIB compactifications withnontrivial NS and RR three-form fluxes. By incorporating known corrections tothe superpotential from Euclidean D-brane instantons or gaugino condensation,one can make models with all moduli fixed, yielding a supersymmetric AdSvacuum. Inclusion of a small number of anti-D3 branes in the resulting warpedgeometry allows one to uplift the AdS minimum and make it a metastable deSitter ground state. The lifetime of our metastable de Sitter vacua is muchgreater than the cosmological timescale of 10^10 years. We also prove, undercertain conditions, that the lifetime of dS space in string theory will alwaysbe shorter than the recurrence time.
