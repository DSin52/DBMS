Title: Deconfinement mechanism in three dimensions for gauge fields coupled to

bosonic matter fields with fundamental chargeAuthors: Flavio S. Nogueira and Asle Sudbo

Comments: LaTex, 5 pages, no figures

We propose a mechanism by which electric charges deconfine in an AbelianHiggs model with matter fields belonging to the fundamental representation ofthe gauge group. Kosterlitz-Thouless like recursion relations for ascale-dependent stiffness parameter and fugacity are given, showing that for alogarithmic potential between point charges in any dimension, there exists astable fixed point at zero fugacity, with a dimensionality dependent universaljump in the stiffness parameter at the phase transition.
