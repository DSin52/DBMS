The super-AdS_5 X S^5 and the four-dimensional N=4 superconformal algebrasplay important roles in superstring theories. It is often discussed the rolesof the osp(1|32) algebra as a maximal extension of the superalgebras in flatbackground. In this paper we show that the su(2,2|4), the super-AdS_5 X S^5algebra or the superconformal algebra, is not a restriction of the osp(1|32)though the bosonic part of the former is a subgroup of the latter. There existonly two types of u(1) extension of the super-AdS_5 X S^5 algebra if thebosonic AdS_5 X S^5 covariance is imposed. Possible significance of the resultsis also discussed briefly.
