It is shown that the quantization of a superparticle propagating in an N=1,D=4 superspace extended with tensorial coordinates results in an infinite towerof massless spin states satisfying the Vasiliev unfolded equations for higherspin fields in flat and AdS_4 N=1 superspace. The tensorial extension of theAdS_4 superspace is proved to be a supergroup manifold OSp(1|4). The model ismanifestly invariant under an OSp(N|8) (N=1,2) superconformal symmetry. As abyproduct, we find that the Cartan forms of arbitrary Sp(2n) and OSp(1|2n)groups are GL(2n) flat, i.e. they are equivalent to flat Cartan forms up to aGL(2n) rotation. This property is crucial for carrying out the quantization ofthe particle model on OSp(1|4) and getting the higher spin field dynamics insuper AdS_4, which can be performed in a way analogous to the flat case.
