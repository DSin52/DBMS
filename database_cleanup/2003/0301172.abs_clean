We study a six dimensional braneworld model in the case where the fourdimensional brane is described by a topologically stable vortex of a U(1)symmetry-breaking Abelian Higgs model. We revisit the range of the microscopicparameters that leads to gravity confinement on the brane. In particular, wefind that the necessary fine-tuning is much tighter than previously though, andqualitatively different from that of a five dimensional braneworld with a branedescribed by a domain wall. The investigation of gauge invariant perturbationsaround this background solution reveals that, contrary to the five dimensionalcase, there exist perturbation modes which can only satisfy the boundarycondition of being bounded far from the brane provided they are tachyonicinside the brane. The warped space-time structure that is obtained this way isthus unstable. The genericness of our conclusions is discussed; this will shedsome light on the possibility of describing our spacetime as a general sixdimensional braneworld.
