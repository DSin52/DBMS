Authors: Naohito Nakazawa

Comments: 14 pages, no figures

Stochastic quantization method is applied to N = 1 super Yang-Mills theoryespecially in 4 and 10 dimensions. In 4 dimensional case, based on the Itocalculus, the Langevin equation is derived in the superfield formalism. Thestochastic process manifestly preserves both the local gauge symmetry and theglobal N = 1 supersymmetry in the sense of Ito. The corresponding Fokker-Planckequation reproduces the action of the superfield SYM_4 at the equilibriumlimit. The component expression of the superfield Langevin equation isnaturally extended to a Langevin equation for 10 dimensional case where thespinor field is Majorana-Weyl. By taking a naive zero volume limit of SYM_10,IIB matirx model is discussed in this context.
