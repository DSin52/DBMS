We show that the string bit model suffers from doubling in the fermionicsector. The doubling leads to strong violation of supersymmetry in the limit$N\to\infty$. Since there is an exact correspondence between string bits andthe algebra of BMN operators even at finite $N$, doubling is expected also onthe side of super-Yang--Mills theory. We discuss the origin of the doubling inthe BMN sector.
