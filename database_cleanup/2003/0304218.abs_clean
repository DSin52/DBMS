Title: Gauging internal fermionic symmetries and spin 3/2 fields

Authors: S.T. Love

Comments: 9 pages

Field theoretic models possessing a global internal fermionic shift symmetryare considered. When such a symmetry is realized locally, spin 3/2 fieldsappear naturally as gauge fields. Implementation of the gauging procedurerequires not only the usual replacement of ordinary derivatives by covariantderivatives containing the spin 3/2 fields, but also the inclusion ofadditional monomials. The Higgs mechanism and the high energy Nambu-Goldstonefermion equivalence theorem are explicitly demonstrated.
