Title: The statistics of string/M theory vacua

Authors: Michael R. Douglas

Comments: harvmac, 72pp (v4

We discuss systematic approaches to the classification of string/M theoryvacua, and physical questions this might help us resolve. To this end, weinitiate the study of ensembles of effective Lagrangians, which can be used toprecisely study the predictive power of string theory, and in simple examplescan lead to universality results. Using these ideas, we outline an approach toestimating the number of vacua of string/M theory which can realize theStandard Model.
