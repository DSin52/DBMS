Title: Classes of exact wavefunctions for general time-dependent Dirac

Hamiltonians in 1+1 dimensionsAuthors: A. S. de Castro and A. de Souza Dutra

In this work we construct two classes of exact solutions for the most generaltime-dependent Dirac Hamiltonian in 1+1 dimensions. Some problems regarding tosome formal solutions in the literature are discussed. Finally the existence ofa generalized Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant connected with such solutions isdiscussed.
