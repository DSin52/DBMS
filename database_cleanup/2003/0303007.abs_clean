introduction. The "cyclic perms." term removed from some equations asunnecessary and equations (2.38) and (3.19) are corrected accordinglyWe compute the graviton two scalar off-shell interaction vertex at tree levelin Type IIB superstring theory on the pp-wave background using the light-conestring field theory formalism. We then show that the tree level vertex vanisheswhen all particles are on-shell and conservation of p_{+} and p_{-} areimposed. We reinforce our claim by calculating the same vertex starting fromthe corresponding SUGRA action expanded around the pp-wave background in thelight-cone gauge.
