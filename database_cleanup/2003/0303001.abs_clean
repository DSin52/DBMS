We use the Konishi anomaly equations to construct the exact effectivesuperpotential of the glueball superfields in various N=1 supersymmetric gaugetheories. We use the superpotentials to study in detail the structure of thespaces of vacua of these theories. We consider chiral and non-chiral SU(N)models, the exceptional gauge group G(2) and models that break supersymmetrydynamically.
