We study N=1 supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory coupled to an adjoint scalarsuperfiled with a cubic superpotential containing a multi trace term. We showthat the field theory results can be reproduced from a matrix model which itspotential is given in terms of a linearized potential obtained from the gaugetheory superpotential by adding some auxiliary nondynamical field. Once we getthe effective action from this matrix model we could integrate out theauxiliary field getting the correct field theory results.
