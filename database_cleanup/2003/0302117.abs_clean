Title: Doubly Periodic Instantons and their Constituents

Authors: Chris Ford, Jan M.Pawlowski

Comments: 23 pages, 4 figures

Using the Nahm transform we investigate doubly periodic charge one SU(2)instantons with radial symmetry. Two special points where the Nahm zero modeshave softer singularities are identified as the locations of instanton coreconstituents. For a square torus this constituent picture is closely reflectedin the action density. In rectangular tori with large aspect ratios the coresmerge to form monopole-like objects. For particular values of the parametersthe torus can be cut in half yielding two copies of a twisted charge 1/2instanton. These findings are illustrated with plots of the action densitywithin a two-dimensional slice containing the constituents.
