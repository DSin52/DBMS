Title: Area spectrum and quasinormal modes of black holes

Authors: Alexios P. Polychronakos

Comments: 11 pages, no figures; references added

We demonstrate that an equidistant area spectrum for the link variables inloop quantum gravity can reproduce both the thermodynamics and the quasinormalmode properties of black holes.
