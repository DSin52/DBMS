International Londrina School, Brazil. IJMPAA synthetic report of the advances in the study of classical and quantummultistring solutions; the effect of a cosmological constant and of spacialcurvature on classical and quantum strings; classical splitting of fundamentalstrings;the general string evolution in constant curvature spacetimes;theconformal invariant effects;strings on plane waves, shock waves and spacetimesingularities and its spectrum. New developments in string gravity and stringprimordial gravitation wave background; non-singular string cosmologies fromexact conformal field theories;QFT, string temperature and the string phase ofde Sitter space; the string phase of black holes;new dual relation between QFTregimes and string regimes and the 'QFT/String Tango'; new coherent stringstates and minimal uncertainty principle in string theory
