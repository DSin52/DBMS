Title: BRST-Invariant Constraint Algebra in Terms of Commutators and Quantum

AntibracketsAuthors: Igor Batalin and Igor Tyutin

Comments: 20 pages; some misprints are removed

General structure of BRST-invariant constraint algebra is established, in itscommutator and antibracket forms, by means of formulation of algebra-generatingequations in yet more extended phase space. New ghost-type variables behave asfields and antifields with respect to quantum antibrackets. Explicit form ofBRST-invariant gauge algebra is given in detail for rank-one theories withWeyl- and Wick- ordered ghost sector. A gauge-fixed unitarizing Hamiltonian isconstructed, and the formalism is shown to be physically equivalent to thestandard BRST-BFV approach.
