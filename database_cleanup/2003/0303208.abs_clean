We address dynamical supersymmetry breaking within a N=1 supersymmetricStandard-like Model based on a Z_2 x Z_2 Type IIA orientifold with intersectingD6-branes. The model possesses an additional, confining gauge sector with theUSp(2)_A x USp(2)_B x USp(4) gauge group, where the gaugino condensationmechanism allows for the breaking of supersymmetry and stabilizes moduli. Wederive the leading contribution to the non-perturbative effectivesuperpotential and determine numerically the minima of the supergravitypotential. These minima break supersymmetry and fix two undetermined moduli,which in turn completely specify the gauge couplings at the string scale. Forthis specific construction the minima have a negative cosmological constant. Weexpect that for other supersymmetric Standard-like models with intersectingD6-branes, which also possess confining gauge sectors, the supersymmetrybreaking mechanism would have qualitatively similar features.
