VariablesAuthors: Luciano Barosi, Carlos Tello

Comments: 30 pages

We consider the $GSO(-)$ sector of the open superstring using the formalismwith four-dimensional hybrid variables. This sector is defined by the worldsheet hybrid variables $(\theta^{\alpha},\bar{\theta}^{\dot\alpha})$ withantiperiodic boundary conditions. The corresponding spectrum of states andconditions for physical vertices are described. In particular we constructexplicitly the lower level $GSO(-)$ vertex operators corresponding to thetachyon and the massless fermions. Using these new vertices, the tachyon andmassless sector contribution to the superstring field theory action ofBerkovits is evaluated. In this way we have included the Ramond sector and weend by discussing some features of the action
