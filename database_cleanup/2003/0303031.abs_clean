In gravitational theories with extra dimensions, it is argued that theexistence of a positive vacuum energy generically implies catastrophicinstability of our four-dimensional world. The most generic instability is adecompactification transition to growth of the extra dimensions, although otherequally bad transitions may take place. This follows from simple considerationsbased on the form of the potential for the size modulus of the extradimensions, and apparently offers a resolution of the conundrums presented byeternal de Sitter space. This argument is illustrated in the context of stringtheory with a general discussion of potentials generated by fluxes, wrappedbranes, and stringy corrections. Moreover, it is unlikely that the presentacceleration of the Universe represents an ongoing transition in a quintessencescenario rolling towards decompactification, unless the higher dimensionaltheory has a cosmological constant.
