In the present article, we study the space-time geometry felt by probebosonic string moving in antisymmetric and dilaton background fields. Thisspace-time geometry we shall call the stringy geometry. In particular, thepresence of the antisymmetric field leads to the space-time torsion, and thepresence of the dilaton field leads to the space-time nonmetricity. Wegeneralize the geometry of surfaces embedded in space-time to the case whentorsion and nonmetricity are present. We define the mean extrinsic curvaturefor Minkowski signature and introduce the concept of mean torsion. Itsorthogonal projection defines the dual mean extrinsic curvature. In thislanguage, one field equation is just the equality of mean extrinsic curvatureand dual mean extrinsic curvature, which we call self-duality relation. In thetorsion and nonmetricity free case, the world-sheet is a minimal surface,specified by the requirement that mean extrinsic curvature vanishes. Generally,it is stringy self-dual (anti self-dual) surface. In the presence of thedilaton field, which breaks conformal invariance, the conformal factor whichconnects intrinsic and induced metrics, is determined as a function of thedilaton field itself. We also derive the integration measure for the space-timewith stringy nonmetricity.
