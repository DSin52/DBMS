The Maldacena-Nunez solution is generalized to include a number ofintegration constants, one of which controls the resolution of the singularityof the wrapped D5-brane background. Some features of the dual pure N=1 superYang-Mills (SYM) theory are calculated, amongst which the gluino condensate,the beta function of the gauge coupling and a brane probe potential, which isrelated to the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective potential. Each integrationconstant has a precise meaning in the dual SYM theory, e.g., the amount ofnon-perturbative SYM physics captured by the gravity configuration is describedby the singularity resolution parameter.
