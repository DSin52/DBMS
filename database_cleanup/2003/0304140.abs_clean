A method for systematically including topological degrees of freedom inperturbation theory is developed. This is not bound by the restrictions ofsemi-classical techniques. The Yang-Mills theory in three Euclidean dimensionsis considered here. A well-defined separation of the topological and the ``spinwave'' degrees of freedom is obtained, motivated by a singular gauge. This has``photons'' distorting the spherically symmetric magnetic fields of Diracmonopoles, and massless charged vector bosons ``W'' scattering off the latter.It is explicitly shown that the Dirac string does not contribute. The mode ofthe charged vector bosons with total angular momentum J=0 provides preciselythe core to give a finite energy to the monopole. The radial equation for W isremarkably simplified and only two polarization states survive exactly for theanomalous magnetic moment required by the Yang-Mills interaction.
