Title: Inflation and Kahler Stabilization of the Dilaton

Authors: David Skinner

Comments: 12 pages, submitted to PRD

The problems of attempting inflationary model-building in a theory containinga dilaton are explained. In particular, I study the shape of the dilatonpotential today and during inflation, based on a weakly-coupled heteroticstring model where corrections to the Kahler potential are assumed to beresponsible for dilaton stabilization. Although no specific model-building isattempted, if the inflationary energy density is related to the scale ofgaugino condensation, then the dilaton may be stabilized close enough totoday's value that there is no significant change in the GUT scale coupling.This can occur in a very wide range of models, and helps to provide somejustification for the standard predictions of the spectral index. I explain howthis result can ultimately be traced to the supersymmetry structure of thetheory.
