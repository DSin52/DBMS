In many high dimensional noncommutative theories, no state saturatessimultaneously all the non trivial Heisenberg uncertainty relations. Thisdiffers from the usual theory where the squeezed states possess this property.The important role played by these states when recovering classical mechanicsas a limit of quantum theory makes necessary the investigation of the possiblegeneralizations in the noncommutative context.We propose an extension based on a variational principle. The actionconsidered is the sum of the squares of the terms associated to the non trivialHeisenberg uncertainty relations. We first verify that our proposal works instates which can be expressed as products of gaussians with specifichypergeometrics.We illustrate our construction in three models defined on a four dimensionalpopular case in which the commutators of the positions are constants. In thesethree models, our proposal leads to second order partial differentialequations. We find analytical solutions in specific cases. We briefly discusshow our method may be applied to the fuzzy sphere.To emphasize that the recovering of classical behaviours is not a trivialquestion in the non commutative context, we show how the difference ofstructure between the Poisson brackets and the commutators in the theoriesanalyzed here generically leads to a loss of periodicity for the harmonicoscillator.
