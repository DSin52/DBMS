Explicit supersymmetry breaking is studied in higher dimensional theories byhaving boundaries respect only a subgroup of the bulk symmetry. If the boundarysymmetry is the maximal subgroup allowed by the boundary conditions imposed onthe fields, then the symmetry can be consistently gauged; otherwise gaugingleads to an inconsistent theory. In a warped fifth dimension, an explicitbreaking of all bulk supersymmetries by the boundaries is found to beinconsistent with gauging; unlike the case of flat 5D, complete supersymmetrybreaking by boundary conditions is not consistent with supergravity. Despitethis result, the low energy effective theory resulting from boundarysupersymmetry breaking becomes consistent in the limit where gravity decouples,and such models are explored in the hope that some way of successfullyincorporating gravity can be found. A warped constrained standard model leadsto a theory with one Higgs boson with mass expected close to the experimentallimit. A unified theory in a warped fifth dimension is studied with boundarybreaking of both SU(5) gauge symmetry and supersymmetry. The usualsupersymmetric prediction for gauge coupling unification holds even though theTeV spectrum is quite unlike the MSSM. Such a theory may unify matter and Higgsin the same SU(5) hypermultiplet.
