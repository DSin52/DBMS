Title: Thermal behavior induced by vacuum polarization on causal horizons in

comparison with the standard heat bath formalismAuthors: Bert Schroer (CBPF, Rio de Janeiro)

Comments: 15 page Latex, dedicated to A. A. Belavin on the occasion of his 60th

birthdayModular theory of operator algebras and the associated KMS property are usedto obtain a unified description for the thermal aspects of the standard heatbath situation and those caused by quantum vacuum fluctuations fromlocalization. An algebraic variant of lightfront holography reveals that thevacuum polarization on wedge horizons is compressed into the lightraydirection. Their absence in the transverse direction is the prerequisite to anarea (generalized Bekenstein-) behavior of entropy-like measures which revealthe loss of purity of the vacuum due to restrictions to wedges and theirhorizons. Besides the well-known fact that localization-induced (generalizedHawking-) temperature is fixed by the geometric aspects, this area behavior(versus the standard volume dependence) constitutes the main difference betweenlocalization-caused and standard thermal behavior.
