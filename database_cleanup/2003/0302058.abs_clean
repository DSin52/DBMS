Some recent studies have implied that quantum fluctuations will prevent anear-extremal black hole from ever attaining a state of precise extremality. Inthis paper, we consider the analogous situation for the scenario of a nearlydegenerate Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole (of arbitrary dimensionality).For this purpose, we utilize a holographic type of duality between thesolutions of interest and the near-massless sector of (two-dimensional)Jackiw-Teitelboim theory. After explicitly demonstrating this duality, we go onto argue that, on the basis of one-loop considerations, a similar censorshipapplies in this de Sitter context. That is, quantum back-reaction effects willconspire to prohibit a non-degenerate Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime fromcontinuously evolving into a degenerate (i.e., Nariai) black hole solution.
