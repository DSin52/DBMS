Title: On different actions for the vacuum of bosonic string field theory

Authors: Nadav Drukker

Comments: 15 pages

We study a family of kinetic operators in string field theory describing thetheory around the closed string vacuum. Those operators are based on theanalytical classical solutions of Takahashi and Tanimoto and are analogous tothe pure ghost action usually referred to as "vacuum string field theory," butare much more general, and less singular than the pure ghost operator. Theclosed string vacuum is related to the D-brane vacuum by large, singular, gaugetransformations or field redefinition, and all those different representationsare related to each other by small gauge transformations. We try to clarify thenature of this singular gauge transformation. We also show that by choosing theSiegel gauge one recovers the propagator proposed in hep-th/0207266 thatgenerates closed string surfaces.
