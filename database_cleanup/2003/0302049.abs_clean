We describe the supergravity solutions dual to D6-branes with bothtime-dependent and time-independent B-fields. These backgrounds generalize thebackground fluxes. In the time-dependent case, the warping takes a novel form.Kaluza-Klein reduction in these backgrounds is unusual, and we explore some ofthe new features. In particular, we describe how a localized gauge-fieldemerges with an analogue of the open string metric and coupling. We alsodescribe a gravitational analogue of the Seiberg-Witten map. This provides aframework in supergravity both for studying non-commutative gauge theories, andfor constructing novel warped backgrounds.
