Effect; Strongly Correlated ElectronsThe magnetic field redefinition in Jain's composite fermion model for thefractional quantum Hall effect is shown to be effectively described by amean-field approximation of a model containing a Maxwell-Chern-Simons gaugefield non-minimally coupled to matter. Also an explicit non-relativistic limitof the non-minimal (2+1)D Dirac equation is derived.
