Comments: 9 pages, RevTex, to be published in Phys.Rev.D15

We prove the uniqueness theorem for static higher dimensional charged blackholes spacetime containing an asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface withcompact interior and with both degenerate and non-degenerate components of theevent horizon.
