Consistent Hamiltonian interactions that can be added to an abelian freeBF-type class of theories in any n greater or equal to 4 spacetime dimensionsare constructed in the framework of the Hamiltonian BRST deformation based oncohomological techniques. The resulting model is an interacting field theory inhigher dimensions with an open algebra of on-shell reducible first-classconstraints. We argue that the Hamiltonian couplings are related to a naturalstructure of Poisson manifold on the target space.
