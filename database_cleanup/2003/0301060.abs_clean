We consider the two-dimensional model of W3-gravity within Lagrangianquantization methods for general gauge theories. We use the Batalin-Vilkoviskyformalism to study the arbitrariness in the realization of the gauge algebra.We obtain a one-parametric non-analytic extension of the gauge algebra, and acorresponding solution of the classical master equation, related via ananticanonical transformation to a solution corresponding to an analyticrealization. We investigate the possibility of closed solutions of theclassical master equation in the Sp(2)-covariant formalism and show that suchsolutions do not exist in the approximation up to the third order in ghost andauxiliary fields.
