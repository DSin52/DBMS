Title: Duality and interacting families in models with the inverse-squared

interactionAuthors: Ivan Andric and Danijel Jurman

Comments: 10 pages

Weak-strong coupling duality relations are shown to be present in thequantum-mechanical many-body system with the interacting potential proportionalto the pair-wise inverse-squared distance in addition to the harmonicpotential. Using duality relations we have solved the problem of familiesinteracting by the inverse-squared interaction. Owing to duality, the couplingconstants of the families are mutually inverse. The spectrum and eigenfunctionsare determined mainly algebraically owing to O(2,1) dynamical symmetry. Theconstructed Hamiltonian for families and appropriate solutions are ofhierarchical nature.
