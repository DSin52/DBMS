Title: Geometric Second Order Field Equations for General Tensor Gauge Fields

Authors: P. de Medeiros, C. Hull

Comments: 34 pages, LaTeX

Higher spin tensor gauge fields have natural gauge-invariant field equationswritten in terms of generalised curvatures, but these are typically of higherthan second order in derivatives. We construct geometric second order fieldequations and actions for general higher spin boson fields, and first orderones for fermions, which are non-local but which become local on gauge-fixing,or on introducing auxiliary fields. This generalises the results of Francia andSagnotti to all representations of the Lorentz group.
