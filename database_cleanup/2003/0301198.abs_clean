We investigate both analytically and numerically the evolution of scalarperturbations generated in models which exhibit a smooth transition from acontracting to an expanding Friedmann universe. We find that the resultingspectral index in the late radiation dominated universe depends on which of the$\Psi$ or \$zeta$ variables passes regularly through the transition. Theresults can be parameterized through the exponent $q$ defining the rate ofcontraction of the universe. For $q \geq -1/2$ we find that there are no stablecases where both variables are regular during the transition. In particular,for $0<q\ll 1$, we find that the resulting spectral index is close to scaleinvariant if $\Psi$ is regular, whereas it has a steep blue behavior if $\zeta$is regular. We also show that as long as $q\leqslant 1$, perturbations arisingfrom the Bardeen potential remain small during contraction in the sense thatthere exists a gauge in which all the metric and matter perturbation variablesare small.
