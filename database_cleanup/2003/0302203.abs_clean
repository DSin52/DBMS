On the basis of the Berkovits pure spinor formalism of covariant quantizationof supermembrane, we attempt to construct a M(atrix) theory which is covariantunder $SO(1,10)$ Lorentz group. We first construct a bosonic M(atrix) theory bystarting with the first-order formalism of bosonic membrane, which preciselygives us a bosonic sector of M(atrix) theory by BFSS. Next we generalize thismethod to the construction of M(atrix) theory of supermembranes. However, itseems to be difficult to obtain a covariant and supersymmetric M(atrix) theoryfrom the Berkovits pure spinor formalism of supermembrane because of the matrixcharacter of the BRST symmetry. Instead, in this paper, we construct asupersymmetric and covariant matrix model of 11D superparticle, whichcorresponds to a particle limit of covariant M(atrix) theory. By an explicitcalculation, we show that the one-loop effective potential is trivial, therebyimplying that this matrix model is a free theory at least at the one-looplevel.
