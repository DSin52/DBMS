The NAHE-set, that underlies the realistic free fermionic models, correspondsto Z2XZ2 orbifold at an enhanced symmetry point, with (h_{11},h_{21})=(27,3).Alternatively, a manifold with the same data is obtained by starting with aZ2XZ2 orbifold at a generic point on the lattice and adding a freely acting Z2involution. In this paper we study type I orientifolds on the manifolds thatunderly the NAHE-based models by incorporating such freely acting shifts. Wepresent new models in the Type I vacuum which are modulated by Z2^n for n=2,3.In the case of n=2, the Z2XZ2 structure is a composite orbifold Kaluza-Kleinshift arrangement. The partition function provides a simpler spectrum withchiral matter. For n=3, the two cases discusse are Z2 modulations of theT^6/(Z2 X Z2) spectrum. The additional projection shows an enhanced closed andopen sector with chiral matter. The second example involves a modulation usinga product of Kaluza Klein and winding shifts. The winding shift provides thismodel with a simpler torus spectrum, particularly with the removal of part ofthe twisted sector. In from those which are present in the Z2XZ2 orbifold. Thelast two incorporate twisted terms that can provide discrete torsion, wediscuss the spectral content of each model with discrete torsion withparticular choice epsilon=(1,1,-1).
