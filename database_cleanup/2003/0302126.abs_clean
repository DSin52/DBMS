Title: Uncertainty of Velocity in kappa-Minkowski Spacetime

A velocity of a point particle in the kappa-Minkowski spacetime isinvestigated. Characteristic points of the spacetime are that the Poincaregroup becomes a quantum group with kappa, which is a mass dimension parameter,and is a kind of non-commutative geometry. We consider a particle in acoordinate space instead of it in a momentum space which is discussed in manyarticles. We see that the particle's velocity has an uncertainty which dependson a length of particle's propagation.
