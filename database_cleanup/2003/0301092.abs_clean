We study D3-branes in an NS5-branes background defined by an arbitrary 4dharmonic function. Using a gauge-invariant formulation of Born-Infeld dynamicsas well as the supersymmetry condition, we find the general solution for the$\omega$-field. We propose an interpretation in terms of the Myers effect.
