Recently it was observed that the hyperbolic compactification of M/stringtheory related to S-branes may lead to a transient period of acceleration ofthe universe. We study time evolution of the corresponding effective 4dcosmological model supplemented by cold dark matter and show that it ismarginally possible to describe observational data for the late-time cosmicacceleration in this model. However, investigation of the compactification 11dof the same order as the size of the observable part of the universe. Assumingthat this problem, as well as several other problems of this scenario, can beresolved, we propose a possible solution of the cosmological coincidenceproblem due to relation between the dark energy density and the effectivedimensionality of the universe.
