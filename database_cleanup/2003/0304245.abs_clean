We first review the Stueckelberg field in the massive Abelian gauge theory.We then extend this idea to the standard model, stueckelberging the hyperchargeU(1) and thus giving a mass to the photon. This introduces an infraredregulator for the photon in the standard electroweak theory, along with amodification of the Weinberg angle accompanied by a plethora of new effects.Finally, we review the historical influence of Stueckelberg's 1938 idea, whichled notably to the discovery of the Higgs mechanism in spontaneous symmetrybreaking as the only presently known way to give masses to non-Abelian vectorfields.
