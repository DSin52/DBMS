In this paper, a general theory on unification of non-Abelian SU(N) gaugeinteractions and gravitational gauge interactions is discussed. SU(N) gaugeinteractions and gravitational gauge interactions are formulated on the similarbasis and are unified in a semi-direct product group GSU(N). Based on thismodel, we can discuss unification of fundamental interactions of Nature.
