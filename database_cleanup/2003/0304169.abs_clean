AdS_3xS^7 geometryThe most general parallelizable pp-wave backgrounds which are non-dilatonicsolutions in the NS-NS sector of type IIA and IIB string theories areconsidered. We demonstrate that parallelizable pp-wave backgrounds arenecessarily homogeneous plane-waves, and that a large class of homogeneousplane-waves are parallelizable, stating the necessary conditions. Suchplane-waves can be classified according to the number of preservedsupersymmetries. In type IIA, these include backgrounds preserving 16, 18, 20,22 and 24 supercharges, while in the IIB case they preserve 16, 20, 24 or 28supercharges. An intriguing property of parallelizable pp-wave backgrounds isthat the bosonic part of these solutions are invariant under T-duality, whilethe number of supercharges might change under T-duality. Due to their \alpha'exactness, they provide interesting backgrounds for studying string theory.Quantization of string modes, their compactification and behaviour underT-duality are studied. In addition, we consider BPS $Dp$-branes, and show thatthese $Dp$-branes can be classified in terms of the locations of their worldvolumes with respect to the background $H$-field.
