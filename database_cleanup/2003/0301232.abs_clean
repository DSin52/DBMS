We consider compactification of the SO(32) heterotic string on a6-dimensional Z_3 orbifold with one discrete Wilson line. A complete set of allpossible embeddings is given. The unbroken subgroups of SO(32) are tabulated.The extended gauge symmetry SU(3)^3, recently discussed by J. E. Kim[hep-th/0301177] for semi-realistic E_8 x E_8 heterotic string models, occursfor several embeddings, as well as other groups that may be of interest inunified string models. The extent to which extra gauge group factors can behidden is discussed and compared to the E_8 x E_8 case. Along flat directionswhere an effective hidden sector exists, the embeddings described here providefor hidden gauge groups that are not possible in the E_8 x E_8 heteroticstring.
