Title: Unruh effect as particular Frenet-Serret vacuum radiation and detection

proposalsComments: 9 pages, contribution for QABP-3 Japan, to be published in the

proceedings, proposal of Scully and collaborators listedThe paradigmatic Unruh radiation is an ideal and simple case of stationaryscalar vacuum radiation patterns related to worldlines defined as Frenet-Serretcurves. We briefly review the corresponding body of theoretical literature aswell as the proposals that have been suggested to detect these types of quantumfield radiation patterns
