Title: Cubic Matrix, Generalized Spin Algebra and Uncertainty Relation

Authors: Yoshiharu Kawamura

Comments: Latex, 13pages

We propose a generalization of spin algebra using three-index objects. Thereis a possibility that a triple commutation relation among three-index objectsimplies a kind of uncertainty relation among their expectation values.
