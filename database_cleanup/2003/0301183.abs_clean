Title: Optimal Renormalization-Group Improvement of R(s) via the Method of

CharacteristicsAuthors: V. Elias (University of Western Ontario), D.G.C. McKeon (University of

Western Ontario), T.G. Steele (University of Saskatchewan)We discuss the application of the method of characteristics to therenormalization-group equation for the perturbative QCD series within theelectron-positron annihilation cross-section. We demonstrate how one suchrenormalization-group improvement of this series is equivalent to a closed-formsummation of the first four towers of renormalization-group accessiblelogarithms to all orders of perturbation theory.
