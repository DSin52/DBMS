Title: Brane-Bulk Interaction and Holographic Principle

Comments: 9 pages, REVTEX

We introduce the brane-bulk interaction to discuss a limitation of thecosmological Cardy-Verlinde formula which is useful for the holographicdescription of brane cosmology. In the presence of the brane-bulk interaction,we cannot find the entropy representation of the first Friedmann equation (thecosmological Cardy-Verlinde formula). In the absence of the interaction, thecosmological Cardy-Verlinde formula is established even for the time-dependentcharged AdS background. Hence, if there exists a dynamic exchange of energybetween the brane and the bulk (that is, if $\tilde T^t~_y \not=0$), we cannotachieve the cosmological holographic principle on the brane.
