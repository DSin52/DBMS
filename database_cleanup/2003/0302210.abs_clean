The gauge symmetries of a general dynamical system can be systematicallyobtained following either a Hamiltonean or a Lagrangean approach. In the formercase, these symmetries are generated, according to Dirac's conjecture, by thefirst class constraints. In the latter approach such local symmetries arereflected in the existence of so called gauge identities. The connectionbetween the two becomes apparent, if one works with a first order Lagrangeanformulation. We thereby confirm Dirac's conjecture. Our analysis applies toarbitrary constrained systems with first and second class constraints, and thusextends a previous analysis by one of the authors to such general systems. Weillustrate our general results in terms of several examples.
