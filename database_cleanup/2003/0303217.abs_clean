We study an RNS string with one end fixed on a $D0$-brane and the other endfree as a qualitative guide to the spectrum of hadrons containig one very heavyquark. The mixed boundary conditions break half of the world-sheetsupersymmetry. Boson-fermion masses can still be matched if space-time is 9dimensional; thus SO(8) triality still plays a role in the spectrum, althoughfull space-time supersymmetry does not survive. We quantize the system in atemporal-like gauge where $X^0 \sim \tau$. Only odd $\alpha$ and even $d$ Rmodes remain, while the NS oscillators $b$ become odd-integer moded. Althoughthe gauge choice eliminates negative-norm states at the outset, there are stilleven-moded Virasoro and even(odd) moded super-Virasoro constraints to beimposed in the NS(R) sectors. The Casimir energy is now positive for R states,but vanishes for NS; there are no tachyons. States for $\alpha' M^2 \leq 3$ areexplicitly constructed and found to be organized into SO(8) irreps by(super)constraints, which include a novel "$\sqrt{L_0}$" operator in the NS and$\Gamma^0 \pm I$ in the R sectors. GSO projections are not allowed. Thedistinctive physical signatures of the system are (i) a slope twice that of theopen string, (ii) absence of all but leading trajectories, yielding anasympotic level density $\sim N^{\frac{D-1}{2}}$ instead of $\exp{\sqrt{N}}$.When both ends are fixed, all leading and subleading trajectories areeliminated instead, resulting in a spectrum qualitatively similar to the$J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ particles.
