Symmetry breaking can produce ``Alice'' strings, which alter scatteredcharges and carry monopole number and charge when twisted into loops. Alicebehavior arises algebraically, when a string's untraced Wilson loop obstructsunbroken symmetries -- a fragile criterion. We give a topological criterion,compelling Alice behavior or deforming it away. Our criterion, that \pi_o(H)acts nontrivially on \pi_1(H), links topological Alice strings to topologicalmonopoles. We twist Alice loops to form monopoles, and find nematic and He-3AAlice strings are topological, carrying fundamental monopole charge whentwisted into loops.
