Title: The uses of Connes and Kreimer's algebraic formulation of

renormalization theoryAuthors: Hector Figueroa and Jose M. Gracia-Bondia

Comments: 16 pages, Latex

We show how, modulo the distinction between the antipode and the "twisted" or"renormalized" antipode, Connes and Kreimer's algebraic paradigm trivializesthe proofs of equivalence of the (corrected) Dyson-Salam,Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp and Zimmermann procedures for renormalizing Feynmanamplitudes. We discuss the outlook for a parallel simplification ofcomputations in quantum field theory, stemming from the same algebraicapproach.
