Title: A Comment on the chi_y Genus and Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics

Authors: Timothy J. Hollowood and Tom Kingaby

Comments: 6 pages, JHEP, References added

In this note we show that a simple modification of supersymmetric quantummechanics involving a mass term for half the fermions naturally leads to aderivation of the integral formula for the chi_y genus, a quantity thatinterpolates between the Euler characteristic and arithmetic genus. We notethat this modification naturally arises in the moduli space dynamics ofmonopoles or instantons in theories with 16 supercharges partially broken to 8supercharges by mass terms.
