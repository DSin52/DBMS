We provide a precise definition and analysis of quantum causal histories(QCH). A QCH consists of a discrete, locally finite, causal pre-spacetime withmatrix algebras encoding the quantum structure at each event. The evolution ofquantum states and observables is described by completely positive maps betweenthe algebras at causally related events. We show that this local description ofevolution is sufficient and that unitary evolution can be recovered wherever itshould actually be expected. This formalism may describe a quantum cosmologywithout an assumption of global hyperbolicity; it is thus more general than theWheeler-DeWitt approach. The structure of a QCH is also closely related toquantum information theory and algebraic quantum field theory on a causal set.
