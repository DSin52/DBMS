Title: Stability Issues for w < -1 Dark Energy

Comments: 10 pages LaTeX. Typos corrected. Reference added

Global fits to precision cosmological data which show that there is a darkenergy component comprising about 2/3 of the total cosmological energy alsohint that a dark energy with $w = P/\rho < -1$ is viable, even favored. Here wediscuss implications of such a surprising $w$, including whether it jeopardizesvacuum stability. It appears to be secure in microscopic processes, but whybulk dark energy has not decayed spontaneously is mysterious.
