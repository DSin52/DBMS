Title: A comment on multiple vacua, particle production and the time dependent

AdS/CFT correspondenceAuthors: Vijay Balasubramanian, Thomas S. Levi and Asad Naqvi

Comments: 9 pages

We give an explicit formulation of the time dependent AdS/CFT correspondencewhen there are multiple vacua present in Lorentzian signature. By computingsample two point functions we show how different amplitudes are related bycosmological particle production. We illustrate our methods in two examplelocally AdS spacetime with a bubble of nothing on the boundary. In both casesthe alpha vacua of de Sitter space make an interesting appearance.
