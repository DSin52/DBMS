We illustrate the importance of mass scales and their relation in thespecific case of the linear sigma model within the context of its one loop Wardidentities. In the calculation it becomes apparent the delicate and essentialconnection between divergent and finite parts of amplitudes. Most importantly,the examples shows how to use mass scales identities which are absolutelynecessary to manipulate graphs involving several masses in a way as to show itsequivalence to others involving different (than the previous) masses. Finallywe show that in the context of the Implicitly Regularization all infinite partscan and should be written in terms of a single scale which is therenormalization group scale. This facilitates, e.g., obtaining symmetriccounterterms and immediately lead to the proper definition of RenormalizationGroup Constants.
