Title: On the Q-Ball Profile Function

Authors: T.A. Ioannidou and N.D. V1achos

Comments: 7 pages + 2 figures

We use analytic and numerical methods to obtain the solution of the Q-ballequation of motion. In particular, we show that the profile function of thethree-dimensional Q-ball can be accurately approximated by the symmetrizedWoods-Saxon distribution.
