Title: Paul Dirac and the Pervasiveness of His Thinking

Authors: David I Olive

Comments: 15 pages, Baylor Dirac centenary conference

I shall use a few personal reminiscences of my time as a student andcolleague of Dirac in Cambridge to introduce some reflections on the nature ofresearch in theoretical physics. I shall discuss and illustrate the approach ofDirac to his own research and the pervasiveness of the influence his examplehas provided.I shall discuss how ideas produced at all stages of his career have proved tobe extraordinarily visionary, still motivating and exerting an influence onresearch many years after his death. Examples include his celebrated equationand prediction of the existence of antiparticles, the magnetic monopole and itsquantisation condition, the quantum theory of dynamical systems withconstraints and the membrane theory of the electron.
