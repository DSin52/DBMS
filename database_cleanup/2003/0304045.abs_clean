We argue that the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action coupled to a tachyon, thatis known to reproduce some aspects of open string dynamics, can be obtainedfrom open string theory in a certain limit, which generalizes the limit leadingto the usual DBI action. This helps clarify which aspects of the full openstring theory are captured by this action.
