We investigate the properties of localized anomalous U(1)'s in heteroticstring theory on the orbifold T^6/Z_3. We argue that the local four dimensionaland original ten dimensional Green-Schwarz mechanisms can be implementedsimultaneously, making the theory manifestly gauge invariant everywhere, in thebulk and at the fixed points. We compute the shape of the Fayet-Iliopoulostadpoles, and cross check this derivation for the four dimensional auxiliaryfields by a direct calculation of the tadpoles of the internal gauge fields.Finally we study some resulting consequences for spontaneous symmetry breaking,and derive the profile of the internal gauge field background over theorbifold.
