Authors: B. B. Deo

Comments: 3 pagess

N=1, D=4 Superstring possessing $SO(6)\otimes SO(5)$ gauge symmetry isconstructed from the open bosonic string in twenty six dimension. Withoutbreaking supersymmetry, the gauge symmetry of the model descends to thesupersymmetric standard model of the electroweak scale in four flat dimension.
