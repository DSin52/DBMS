Title: Three-dimensional black hole entropy

Authors: Jan Troost and Asato Tsuchiya

Comments: 20 pages, 2 figures; v2

We discuss in detail the properties of gravity with a negative cosmologicalconstant as viewed in Cherns-Simons theory on a line times a disc. We reanalyzethe problem of computing the BTZ entropy, and show how the demand of unitarityand modular invariance of the boundary conformal field theory severelyconstrain proposals in this framework.
