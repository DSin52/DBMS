Title: The Gravity dual of the Non-Perturbative $ N = 2 $ SUSY Yang-Mills

TheoryComments: 4 pages, LaTeX. Talk given at the IXth International Symposium on

Particles, Strings and Cosmology PASCOS '03, Mumbai-India, January 3-8 2003.The anomalous Ward identity is derived for $N = 2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theories,which is resulted out of Wrapping of $D_5$ branes on Supersymmetric two cycles.From the Ward identity One obtains the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlindeequation and hence can solve for the pre-potential. This way one avoids theproblem of enhancon which maligns the non-perturbative behaviour of theYang-Mills theory resulted out of Wrapped branes.
