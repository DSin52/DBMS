Theoretical Physics, pp.209--239 (Chungbum Publishing House, Seoul). Talk wasgiven by Y. KimWe study dynamics of rolling tachyon and Abelian gauge field on unstableD-branes, of which effective action is given by Born-Infeld type nonlocalaction. Possible cosmological evolutions are also discussed. In the Einsteinframe of string cosmology, every expanding flat universe is proven to bedecelerating.
