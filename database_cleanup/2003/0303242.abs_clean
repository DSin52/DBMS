(2002))We consider the general properties of effective field theories. We note thatthe freedom to fix the renormalization conditions in the effective field theoryis not as great as it seems. The consideration of minimal requirements ofcorrectness of the perturbative scheme based on Dyson's formula for S-matrixleads to severe restriction on the essential parameters of a theory and, hence,on the allowed set of renormalization conditions. In the first part we make ashort review of the structure of localizable effective field theories. Wediscuss the conditions needed to ensure the correctness of the very first stepof perturbative calculation of the S-matrix -- the construction of thetree-level amplitudes. In the second part we consider the examplesdemonstrating the main stages of derivation and analysis of the system ofbootstrap equations.
