AlgebrasInspired by the intimate relationship between Voiculescu's noncommutativeprobability (of type A) and large-N matrix models in physics, we look forphysical models related to noncommutative probability theory of type B. Theseturn out to be fermionic matrix-vector models at the double large-N limit. Theydescribe different quantum orbifold spacetimes with boundaries. Their criticalexponents coincide with that of ordinary quantum spacetime, but theirrenormalised tree-level one-boundary amplitudes differ.
