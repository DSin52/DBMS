We study superstring theories on the Penrose limit of the enhancon geometryrealized by the D(p+4)-branes wrapped on a K3 surface. We first examine thenull geodesics with fixed radius in general brane backgrounds, which givesolvable superstring theories with constant masses. In most cases, thesuperstring theories contain negative mass-squared. We clarify a condition thatthe world-sheet free fields have positive mass-squared. We then apply thiscondition to the enhancon geometry and find that the null geodesics with fixedradius exist only for p=0 case. They define the superstring theories withpositive mass-squared. For p>0 case, we show that there is no null geodesicwith fixed radius. We also discuss the decoupling limit which gives the dualgeometry of super Yang-Mills theory with 8 supercharges. We discuss theK3-volume dependence of the superstring spectrum.
