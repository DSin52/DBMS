We have proposed a method in the context of BFFT approach that leads totruncation of the infinite series regarded to constraints in the extended phasespace, as well as other physical quantities (such as Hamiltonian). This hasbeen done for cases where the matrix of Poisson brackets among the constraintsis symplectic or constant. The method is applied to Proca model, single selfdual chiral bosons and chiral Schwinger models as examples.
