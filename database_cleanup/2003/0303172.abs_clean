Using S(pacelike)-branes defined through rolling tachyon solutions, we showhow the dynamical formation of D(irichlet)-branes and strings in tachyoncondensation can be understood. Specifically we present solutions of S-braneactions illustrating the classical confinement of electric and magnetic fluxinto fundamental strings and D-branes. The role of S-branes in string theory isfurther clarified and their RR charges are discussed. In addition, by examining``boosted'' S-branes, we find what appears to be a surprising dual S-branedescription of strings and D-branes, which also indicates that the criticalelectric field can be considered as a self-dual point in string theory. We alsointroduce new tachyonic S-branes as Euclidean counterparts to non-BPS branes.
