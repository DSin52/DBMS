Comments: latex, 13 pages, references added and some misprints corrected

In this paper the Seiberg-Witten map for a time-dependent background relatedto a null-brane orbifold is studied. The commutation relations of thecoordinates are linear, i.e. it is an example of the Lie algebra type. Theequivalence map between the Kontsevich star product for this background and theWeyl-Moyal star product for a background with constant noncommutativityparameter is also studied.
