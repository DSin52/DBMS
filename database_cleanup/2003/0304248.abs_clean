We consider a toy metric in four dimensional space-time defined in terms of arecursive hierarchical prescription. The matter distribution turns out to beextremely inhomogeneous. Surprisingly, for very large samples the average massdensity tends (very slowly) to a constant. There is no trace of fractaldimension left.
