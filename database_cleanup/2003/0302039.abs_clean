Analytical approximations for ${< \phi^2 >}$ and ${< T^{\mu}_{\nu} >}$ of aquantized scalar field in static spherically symmetric spacetimes are obtained.The field is assumed to be both massive and massless, with an arbitrarycoupling $\xi$ to the scalar curvature, and in a zero temperature vacuum state.The expressions for ${< \phi^2 >}$ and ${< T^{\mu}_{\nu} >}$ are divided intolow- and high-frequency parts. The contributions of the high-frequency modes tothese quantities are calculated for an arbitrary quantum state. As an example,the low-frequency contributions to ${< \phi^2 >}$ and ${< T^{\mu}_{\nu} >}$ arecalculated in asymptotically flat spacetimes in a quantum state correspondingto the Minkowski vacuum (Boulware quantum state). The limits of theapplicability of these approximations are discussed.
