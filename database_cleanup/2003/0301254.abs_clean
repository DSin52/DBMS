Title: Born-Infeld black hole in the isolated horizon framework

Authors: Nora Breton

Comments: 4 pages, 5 figures

In this work we probe the Born-Infeld (BI) black hole in the isolated horizonframework. It turns out that the BI black hole is consistent with the heuristicmodel for colored black holes proposed by Ashtekar et al [(2001)Class.Quant.Grav. v. 18, 919-940]. The model points to the unstability of theBI black hole.
