A set of Markov processes corresponding to systems of hard-core particlesinteracting along the line are shown to be solvable via a dynamic matrixproduct ansatz (DMPA). We show that quantum spin Hamiltonians can be treated bythe DMPA as well, and demonstrate how the DMPA, originally formulated forsystems with open ends, works for periodic systems.
