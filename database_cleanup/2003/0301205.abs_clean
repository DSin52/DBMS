Within the framework of Relativistic Schroedinger Theory (an alternative formof quantum mechanics for relativistic many-particle systems) it is shown that a``positive'' or as a ``negative'' mixture, in analogy to the fermion-bosondichotomy of matter in the conventional theory. The pure states represent alimiting case between the two types of mixtures which themselves are consideredas the RST counterparts of the entangled (fermionic or bosonic) states of theconventional quantum theory. Both kinds of mixtures are kept separated fromdynamical as well as from topological reasons. The 2-particle configurations(N=2) are studied in great detail with respect to their geometric andtopological properties which are described in terms of the Euler class of anappropriate bundle connection. If the underlying space-time manifold (as thebase space of the fibre bundles applied) is parallelisable, the 2-particleconfigurations can be thought to be generated geometrically by an appropriate(2+2) splitting of the local tangent space.
