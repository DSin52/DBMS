In order to study the thermodynamic properties of brane-antibrane systems inthe toroidal background, we compute the finite temperature effective potentialof tachyon T in this system on the basis of boundary string field theory. Wefirst consider the case that all the radii of the target space torus are aboutthe string scale. If the Dp-antiDp pair is extended in all the non-compactdirections, the sign of the coefficient of |T|^2 term of the potential changesslightly below the Hagedorn temperature. This means that a phase transitionoccurs near the Hagedorn temperature. On the other hand, if the Dp-antiDp pairis not extended in all the non-compact directions, the coefficient is keptnegative, and thus a phase transition does not occur. Secondly, we consider thecase that some of the radii of the target space torus are much larger than thestring scale and investigate the behavior of the potential for each value ofthe radii and the total energy. If the Dp-antiDp pair is extended in all thenon-compact directions, a phase transition occurs for large enough totalenergy.
