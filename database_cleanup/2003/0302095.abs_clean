Title: Proper fluctuations associated with quantum tunneling in field theory

Authors: Michael Maziashvili

Comments: Latex, 4 pages, 1 figure

It is shown that, to the lowest order in $\hbar,$ the particle productionrelated to the tunneling that leads to the false vacuum decay is described bythe orthogonal part of fluctuation field with respect to the bounce solution.
