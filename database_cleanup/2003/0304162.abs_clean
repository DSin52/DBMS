Title: Twisted Alice Loops as Monopoles

Authors: Katherine Benson and Tom Imbo

Comments: 10 pages, no figures

Symmetry breaking can produce ``Alice'' strings, which alter scatteredcharges and carry monopole number and charge when twisted into loops. We applyrecent topological results, fixing Alice strings' stability and prescribingtheir twisting into loops with monopole charge, to several models. We show thatAlice strings of condensed matter systems (nematic liquid crystals, He-3A, andrelated systems of non-chiral Bose condensates and amorphous chiralsuperconductors) are topological, and carry fundamental monopole charge whentwisted into loops. Other models yield Alice loops that carry only deposited,and not fundamental, charge.
