Title: Negative Energy Density in Calabi-Yau Compactifications

Authors: Thomas Hertog, Gary T. Horowitz, and Kengo Maeda

We show that a large class of supersymmetric compactifications, including allsimply connected Calabi-Yau and G_2 manifolds, have classical configurationswith negative energy density as seen from four dimensions. In fact, the energydensity can be arbitrarily negative -- it is unbounded from below.Nevertheless, positive energy theorems show that the total ADM energy remainspositive. Physical consequences of the negative energy density include newthermal instabilities, and possible violations of cosmic censorship.
