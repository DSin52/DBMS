We argue that the Penrose limit of a general string background is ageneralization of the Seiberg-Sen limit describing M(atrix) theory as the DLCQof M theory in flat space. The BMN theory of type IIB strings on the maximallysupersymmetric pp-wave background is understood as the exact analogue of theBFSS M(atrix) theory, namely, a DLCQ of IIB string theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5$in the limit of infinite longitudinal momentum. This point of view is used toexplain many features of the BMN duality.
