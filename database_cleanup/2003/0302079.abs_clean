Title: Exceptional Projective Geometries and Internal Symmetries

Authors: Sultan Catto

Comments: 37 pages, 6 figures

A new mneumonic device is shown to emerge in connection with O(7) numericaltensors exhibiting duality and reflecting the natural 7=(4+3) splitting of7-dimensional space. Then Desargues' and Pappus' theorems are shown to beconnected through a geometry that makes use of octonionic numbers exhibitingthis duality. Construction of exceptional Hilbert space based on Jordanalgebras and exceptional projective geometries is illustrated. A briefdiscussion of the Moufang plane and non-Desarguesian geometries is presented.
