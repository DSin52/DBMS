We point out that the worldvolume coordinate functions $x^\mu(\xi)$ of ap-brane interacting with dynamical gravity are Goldstone fields for spacetimediffeomorphisms gauge symmetry. The presence of this gauge invariance isexhibited by its associated Noether identity, which expresses that the sourceequations follow from the gravitational equations. We discuss the spacetimecounterpart of the Higgs effect and show that a p-brane does not carry anylocal degrees of freedom, extending early known general relativity features.Our considerations are also relevant for brane world scenarios.
