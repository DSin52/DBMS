Segal proposed ultraquantum commutation relations with two ultraquantumconstants hbar' and hbar'' besides Planck's quantum constant hbar with avariable i. The Heisenberg quantum algebra is a contraction - in a more generalsense than that of Inonu and Wigner - of the Segal ultraquantum algebra. Theusual constant i arises as a vacuum order-parameter in the quantum limit wherehbar' and hbar'' approach zero. One physical consequence is a discrete spectrumfor canonical variable and space-time coordinates. Another is aninterconvention of time and energy accompnying space-time meltdown (disorder),with a fundamental conversion factor of some kilograms of energy per second.
