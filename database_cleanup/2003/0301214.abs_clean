Title: A space-time approach to multigluon computations in QCD

to effective action termsAuthors: A. I. Karanikas and C. N. Ktorides

Comments: 10 pages

The applicability of the space-time formulation of the gluonic sector of QCDin terms of the Polyakov worldline path integral, via the use of the backgroundfield gauge fixing method, is extended to multi-gluon loop configurations.Relevant master formulas are derived for the computation of effective actionterms.
