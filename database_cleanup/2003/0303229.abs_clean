We investigate the charges and fluxes that can occur in higher-order Abeliangauge theories defined on compact space-time manifolds with boundary. Theboundary is necessary to supply a destination to the electric lines of forceemanating from brane sources, thus allowing non-zero net electric charges, butit also introduces new types of electric and magnetic flux. The resultingstructure of currents, charges, and fluxes is studied and expressed in thelanguage of relative homology and de Rham cohomology and the correspondingabelian groups. These can be organised in terms of a pair of exact sequencesrelated by the Poincar\'e-Lefschetz isomorphism and by a weaker flip symmetryexchanging the ends of the sequences. It is shown how all this structure isbrought into play by the imposition of the appropriately generalised Maxwell'sequations. The requirement that these equations be integrable restricts theworld-volume of a permitted brane (assumed closed) to be homologous to a cycleon the boundary of space-time. All electric charges and magnetic fluxes arequantised and satisfy the Dirac quantisation condition. But through someboundary cycles there may be unquantised electric fluxes associated withquantised magnetic fluxes and so dyonic in nature.
