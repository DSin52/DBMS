A systematic construction is presented of 1/4 BPS operators in N=4superconformal Yang-Mills theory, using either analytic superspace methods orcomponents. In the construction, the operators of the classical theoryannihilated by 4 out of 16 supercharges are arranged into two types. The firsttype consists of those operators that contain 1/4 BPS operators in the fullquantum theory. The second type consists of descendants of operators in longunprotected multiplets which develop anomalous dimensions in the quantumtheory. The 1/4 BPS operators of the quantum theory are defined to beorthogonal to all the descendant operators with the same classical quantumnumbers. It is shown, to order $g^2$, that these 1/4 BPS operators haveprotected dimensions.
