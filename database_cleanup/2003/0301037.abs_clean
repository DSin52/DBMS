Colloquium on Group-Theoretical Methods in Physics. Paris, July 15-22, 2.002We explain how structures related to octonions are ubiquitous in M-theory.All the exceptional Lie groups, and the projective Cayley line and plane appearin M-theory. Exceptional G_2-holonomy manifolds show up as compactifyingspaces, and are related to the M2 Brane and 3-form. We review this evidence,which comes from the initial 11-dim structures. Relations between these objectsare stressed, when extant and understood. We argue for the necessity of abetter understanding of the role of the octonions themselves (in particularnon-associativity) in M-theory.
