We consider a class of non-supersymmetric gauge theories obtained byorbifolding the N=4 super-Yang-Mills theories. We focus on the resulting quivertheories in their deconstructed phase, both at small and large coupling, wherea fifth dimension opens up. In particular we investigate the r\^ole played bythis extra dimension when evaluating the rectangular Wilson loops encoding theinteraction potential between quarks located at different points in theorbifold. The large coupling potential of the deconstructed quiver theory isdetermined using the AdS/CFT correspondence and analysing the correspondingminimal surface solution for the dual gravitational metric. At small coupling,the potential between quarks decreases with their angular distance while atstrong coupling we find a linear dependence at large distance along the(deconstructed) fifth dimension.
