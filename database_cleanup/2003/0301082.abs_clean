Title: How far does the analogy between causal horizon-induced thermalization

with the standard heat bath situation go?Authors: Bert Schroer (CBPF, Rio de Janeiro)

Comments: 10 pages, based on talk given at the 2002 Londrina Winter School

After a short presentation of KMS states and modular theory as the unifyingdescription of thermalizing systems we propose the absence of transverse vacuumfluctuations in the holographic projections as the mechanism for an areabehavior (the transverse area) of localization entropy as opposed to the volumedependence of ordinary heat bath entropy. Thermalization through causallocalization is not a property of QM, but results from the omnipresent vacuumpolarization in QFT and does not require a Gibbs type ensemble avaraging(coupling to a heat bath).
