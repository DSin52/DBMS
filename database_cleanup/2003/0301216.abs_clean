A Fermi ball is a kind of non-topological soliton, which is thought to arisefrom the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $Z_2$ symmetry and tocontribute to cold dark matter. We consider a simple model in which fermionfields with multi-flavors are coupled to a scalar field through Yukawacoupling, and examine how the number of the fermion flavors affects thestability of the Fermi ball against the fragmentation. (1)We find that theFermi ball is stable against the fragmentation in most cases even in the lowestorder thin-wall approximation. (2)We then find that in the other specificcases, the stability is marginal in the lowest order thin-wall approximation,and the next-to-leading order correction determines the stable region of thecoupling constants; We examine the simplest case where the total fermion number$N_i$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $G_i$ of each flavor $i$ are common tothe flavor, and find that the Fermi ball is stable in the limited region of theparameters and has the broader region for the larger number of the flavors.
