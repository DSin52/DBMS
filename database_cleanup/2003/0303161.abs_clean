Title: Mixed Correlation Functions of the Two-Matrix Model

Authors: M. Bertola, B. Eynard

Comments: 16 pages

SystemsWe compute the correlation functions mixing the powers of two non-commutingrandom matrices within the same trace. The angular part of the integration waseigenvalue integration reducing the problem to the construction of theassociated biorthogonal polynomials. The generating function of thesecorrelations becomes then a determinant involving the recursion coefficients ofthe biorthogonal polynomials.
