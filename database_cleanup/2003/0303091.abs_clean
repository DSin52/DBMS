Title: Theta functions on Noncommutative T^4

Authors: Hoil Kim, Chang-Yeong Lee

Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX

We construct the so-called theta vectors on noncommutative T^4, whichcorrespond to the theta functions on commutative tori with complex structures.Following the method of Dieng and Schwarz, we first construct holomorphicconnections and then find the functions satisfying the holomorphic conditions,the theta vectors. The holomorphic structure in the noncommutative T^4 case isgiven by a 2x2 complex matrix, and the consistency requires its off-diagonalelements to be the same. We also construct the tensor product of thesefunctions satisfying the consistency requirement.
