By combining the concepts of graviton and matroid, we outline a newgravitational theory which we call gravitoid theory. The idea of this theoryemerged as an attempt to link the mathematical structure of matroid theory withM-theory. Our observations are essentially based on the formulation of matroidbundle due to MacPherson and Anderson. Also, by considering the orientedmatroid theory, we add new observations about the link between the Fano matroidand D=11 supergravity which was discussed in some of our recent papers. Inparticular we find a connection between the affine matroid AG(3,2) and the $G_{2}-$symmetry of D=11 supergravity.
