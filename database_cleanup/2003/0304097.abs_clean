We apply a recent proposal for defining conserved mass in asymptotically deSitter spacetimes to the class of Taub-Bolt-dS spacetimes. We compute theaction, entropy and conserved mass of these spacetimes, and find that incertain instances the mass and entropy can exceed that of pure de Sitterspacetime, in violation of recent suggestive conjectures to the contrary.
