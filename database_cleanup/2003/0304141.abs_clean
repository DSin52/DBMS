Title: Consistent noncommutative quantum gauge theories?

Authors: A.A.Slavnov

Comments: 10 pages, no figures, LaTex

A new noncommutative model invariant with respect to U(1) gauge group isproposed. The model is free of nonintegrable infrared singularities. Itscommutative classical limit describes a free scalar field. Generalization toU(N) models is also considered.
