We show that there is only one physically acceptable vacuum state for quantumfields in de Sitter space-time which is left invariant under the action of thede Sitter-Lorentz group $SO(1,d)$ and supply its physical interpretation interms of the Poincare invariant quantum field theory (QFT) on one dimensionhigher Minkowski spacetime. We compute correlation functions of the generalizedfield, on the $d$-dimensional de Sitter space and demonstrate that theirlimiting values at timelike infinities on de Sitter space reproduce correlationfunctions in $(d-1)$-dimensional Euclidean conformal field theory (CFT) on$S^{d-1}$ for scalar operators with arbitrary real conformal dimensions. Wealso compute correlation functions for a vertex operator $e^{i\hat{S}(u)}$ onthe \L obaczewski space and find that they also reproduce correlation functionsof the same CFT. The massless field $\hat{S}(u)$ is the nonlocal transform ofthe massless field $\hat{S}(x)$ on de Sitter space introduced by one of us.
