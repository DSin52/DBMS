Title: Energy-momentum conservation laws in higher-dimensional Chern-Simons

modelsAuthors: G.Sardanashvily

Comments: 9 pages

Though a Chern-Simons (2k-1)-form is not gauge-invariant and it depends on abackground connection, this form seen as a Lagrangian of gauge theory on a(2k-1)-dimensional manifold leads to the energy-momentum conservation law.
