Title: D-brane realizations of runaway behavior and moduli stabilization

Authors: David Berenstein

Comments: 15 pages, 3 figures

In this paper we find examples of moduli stabilization and runaway behaviorwhich can be treated exactly. This is shown for supersymmetric field theorieswhich can be realized on the world volume of D-branes. From a geometric pointof view, these field theories lift moduli spaces of vacua by deforming lines ofsingularities where supersymmetric fractional branes can be located in thegeometry without D-branes.
