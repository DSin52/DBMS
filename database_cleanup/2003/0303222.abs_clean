We investigate the correspondence between superstring theory on pp-wavebackground with NSNS-flux and superconformal field theory on a symmetricorbifold. This correspondence can be regarded as the ``Penrose limit'' ofAdS_3/CFT_2 correspondence. Superstring theory on the Penrose limit of AdS_3 xS^3 (x M^4) (M^4 = T^4 or K3) with NSNS-flux can be described by ageneralization of Nappi-Witten model. We quantize this system in the covariantgauge and obtain the spectrum of superstring theory. In the dual CFT point ofview, the Penrose limit means concentrating on the subsector of almost BPSstates with large R-charges. We show that stringy states can be embedded in thesingle-particle Hilbert space of symmetric orbifold theory.
