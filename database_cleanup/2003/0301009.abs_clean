backgroundComments: 12 pages, LaTeX-2e, v2

corrected, new commutators in eq's (4.56), (4.61) addedThe superfield light cone gauge formulation of $\cN =4$ SYM in plane wavebackground is developed. We find a realization of superconformal symmetries interms of a light cone superfield. An oscillator realization of superconformalsymmetries is also obtained.
