Title: Holography and the Deligne Conjecture

We try to explain a possible relation between the Holography principle inphysics (namely the assertion that the quantum theory of gravity on a manifoldwith boundary should coincide with the conformal field theory on the boundary)and the Deligne conjecture in mathematics which states that the Hochschildcomplex of an associative algebra is an algebra over the little 2-discs operad(equivalently it has a natural 2-algebra structure).
