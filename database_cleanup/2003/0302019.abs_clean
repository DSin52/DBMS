Within the program of holographic renormalization, we discuss the computationof three-point correlation functions along RG flows. We illustrate theprocedure in two simple cases. In an RG flow to the Coulomb branch of N=4 SYMtheory we derive a compact and finite expression for the three-point functionof lowest CPO's dual to inert scalars. In the GPPZ flow, that captures somefeatures of N=1 SYM theory, we compute the three-point function with insertionof two inert scalars and one active scalar that mixes with the stress tensor.By amputating the external legs at the mass poles we extract the trilinearcoupling of the corresponding superglueballs. Finally we outline the procedurefor computing three-point functions with insertions of the stress tensor aswell as of (broken) R-symmetry currents.
