Title: Hidden Degeneracy in the Brick Wall Model of Black Holes

Authors: Kumar S. Gupta and Siddhartha Sen

Comments: 8 pages, Latex file

Quantum field theory in the near-horizon region of a black hole predicts theexistence of an infinite number of degenerate modes. Such a degeneracy isregulated in the brick wall model by the introduction of a short distancecutoff. In this Letter we show that states of the brick wall model with nonzero energy admit a further degeneracy for any given finite value of thecutoff. The black hole entropy is calculated within the brick wall model takingthis degeneracy into account. Modes with complex frequencies however do notexhibit such a degeneracy.
