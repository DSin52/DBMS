We study the direct interaction of an antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field with ascalar particle derived from a gauge principle. The method outlined in thispaper to define a covariant derivative is applied to a simple model leading toa linear coupling between the fields. Although no conserved Noether chargeexists, a conserved topological current comes out from the antisymmetryproperties of the Kalb-Ramond field. Some interesting features of this currentare pointed out.
