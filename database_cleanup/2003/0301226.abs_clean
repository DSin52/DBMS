We study matrix models related to $SO/Sp$ gauge theories with flavors. Wegive the effective superpotentials for gauge theories with arbitrary tree levelsuperpotential up to first instanton level. For quartic tree levelsuperpotential we obtained exact one-cut solution. We also deriveSeiberg-Witten curve for these gauge theories from matrix model argument.
