We solve closed string theory in all regular homogeneous plane-wavebackgrounds with homogeneous NS three-form field strength and a dilaton. Theparameters of the model are constant symmetric and anti-symmetric matricesk_{ij} and f_{ij} associated with the metric, and a constant anti-symmetricmatrix h_{ij} associated with the NS field strength. In the light-cone gaugethe rotation parameters f_{ij} have a natural interpretation as a constantmagnetic field. This is a generalisation of the standard Landau problem withoscillator energies now being non-trivial functions of the parameters f_{ij}and k_{ij}. We develop a general procedure for solving linear but non-diagonalequations for string coordinates, and determine the corresponding oscillatorfrequencies, the light-cone Hamiltonian and level matching condition. Weinvestigate the resulting string spectrum in detail in the four-dimensionalcase and compare the results with previously studied examples. Throughout wewill find that the presence of the rotation parameter f_{ij} can lead tocertain unusual and unexpected features of the string spectrum like newmassless states at non-zero string levels, stabilisation of otherwise unstable(tachyonic) modes, and discrete but not positive definite string oscillatorspectra.
