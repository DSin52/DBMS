Authors: M. Chaichian and K. Nishijima

Comments: 7 pages, talk given at the International workshop "Strong Coupling

Gauge Theories and Effective Field Theories", December 2002, Nagoya, JapanIt is shown that a sufficient condition for color confinement is given byZ_3^{-1}=0, where Z_3 denotes the renormalization constant of the color gaugefield.
