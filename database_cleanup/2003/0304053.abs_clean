We perform a systematic study of the one-loop renormalizability of allPoisson-Lie T-dualizable $\si$-models with two-dimensional targets. We showthat whatever Drinfeld double and whatever matrix of coupling constants weconsider the corresponding $\si$-model is always one-loop renormalizable in thestrict field theoretical sense. Moreover, in all cases, the RG flow in thespace of the coupling constants is compatible with the Poisson-Lie T-duality.
