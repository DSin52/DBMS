Comments: 24 p. Minor corrections; version to appear in NPB

Fermionic-type character formulae are presented for chargedirreduciblemodules of the graded parafermionic conformal field theoryassociated to the coset $osp(1,2)_k/u(1)$. This is obtained by counting theweakly ordered `partitions' subject to the graded $Z_k$ exclusion principle.The bosonic form of the characters is also presented.
