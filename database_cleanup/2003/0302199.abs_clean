Title: Phantom Matter and the Cosmological Constant

Motivated by some recent speculative attempts to model the dark energy,scalar fields with negative kinetic energy coupled to gravity without acosmological constant are considered. It is shown that in the presence of anordinary fluid, any solution of the vacuum Einstein equations with cosmologicalconstant is a solution provided $\rho-P={\Lambda \over 4 \pi G}$. The solutionscan be interpreted as a steady state in which matter or entropy is beingcontinuously created (or destroyed). The motion of the matter is not determinedby the background Einstein spacetime, many different matter flows can be foundgiving rise to the same metric. Solutions without ordinary matter are alsoconsidered. Anti-gravitating multi-solutions and repulsive solutions which canchase ordinary matter or black holes are exhibited. These results may also haveapplications to gravity theories with higher derivatives.
