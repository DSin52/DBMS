We explore the effects of a heavy fermion doublet in a simplified version ofthe standard electroweak theory. We integrate out the doublet and compute theexact effective energy functional of spatially varying gauge and Higgs fields.We perform a variational search for a local minimum of the effective energy anddo not find evidence for a soliton carrying the quantum numbers of thedecoupled fermion doublet. The fermion vacuum polarization energy offsets thegain in binding energy previously argued to be sufficient to stabilize afermionic soliton. The existence of such a soliton would have been a naturalway to maintain anomaly cancellation at the level of the states. We also seethat the sphaleron energy is significantly increased due to the quantumcorrections of the heavy doublet. We find that when the doublet is slightlyheavier than the quantum--corrected sphaleron, its decay is exponentiallysuppressed owing to a new barrier. This barrier exists only for an intermediaterange of fermion masses, and a heavy enough doublet is indeed unstable.
