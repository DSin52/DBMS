In this letter, we determine the particle and the string light cone in thepp-wave background. The result is a deformed version of the flat one. We pointout the light cone exhibits an intriguing periodicity in the light cone timedirection x^+ with a period \sim 1/ \mu. Our results also suggest that aquantum theory in the pp-wave background can be formulated consistently only ifthe background is periodic in the light cone time x^+.
