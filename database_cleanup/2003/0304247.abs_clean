We study four dimensional N=2 SO/SP supersymmetric gauge theory on R^3\timesS^1 deformed by a tree level superpotential. We will show that the exactsuperpotential can be obtained by making use of the Lax matrix of thecorresponding integrable model which is the periodic Toda lattice. Theconnection between vacua of SO(2N) and SO(2kN-2k+2) can also be seen in thisframework. Similar analysis can also be applied for SO(2N+1) and SP(2N).
