Recently, it was pointed out that quantum orders and the associatedprojective symmetry groups can produce and protect massless gauge bosons andmassless fermions in local bosonic models. In this paper, we demonstrate that astate with such kind of quantum orders can be viewed as a string condensedstate. The emerging gauge bosons and fermions in local bosonic models can beregarded as a direct consequence of string condensation. The gauge bosons arefluctuations of large closed strings which are condensed in the ground state.The ends of condensed open strings are the charged particles of thecorresponding gauge field. For certain types of strings, the ends of stringscan even be fermions. According to the string picture, fermions always carrygauge charges. This suggests the existence of a new discrete gauge field thatcouples to neutrinos and neutrons. We also discuss how chiral symmetry thatprotects massless Dirac fermions can emerge from the projective symmetry ofquantum order.
