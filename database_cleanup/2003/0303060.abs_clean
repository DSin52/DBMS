Solvable and Integrable SystemsWe argue that existing methods for the perturbative computation of anomalousdimensions and the disentanglement of mixing in N = 4 gauge theory can beconsiderably simplified, systematized and extended by focusing on the theory'sdilatation operator. The efficiency of the method is first illustrated at theone-loop level for general non-derivative scalar states. We then go on toderive, for pure scalar states, the two-loop structure of the dilatationoperator. This allows us to obtain a host of new results. Among these are aninfinite number of previously unknown two-loop anomalous dimensions, newsubtleties concerning 't Hooft's large N expansion due to mixing effects ofdegenerate single and multiple trace states, two-loop tests of variousprotected operators, as well as two-loop non-planar results for two-impurityoperators in BMN gauge theory. We also put to use the recently discoveredintegrable spin chain description of the planar one-loop dilatation operatorand show that the associated Yang-Baxter equation explains the existence of ahitherto unknown planar ``axial'' symmetry between infinitely many gauge theorystates. We present evidence that this integrability can be extended to allloops, with intriguing consequences for gauge theory, and that it leads to anovel integrable deformation of the XXX Heisenberg spin chain. Assuming thatthe integrability structure extends to more than two loops, we determine theplanar three-loop contribution to the dilatation operator.
