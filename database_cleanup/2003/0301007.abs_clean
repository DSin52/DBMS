The non-perturbation and perturbation structures of the q-deformedprobability currents are studied. According to two ways of realizing theq-deformed Heisenberg algebra by the undeformed operators, the perturbationstructures of two q-deformed probability currents are explored in detail.Locally the structures of two perturbation q-deformed probability currents aredifferent, one is explicitly potential dependent; the other is not. But theirtotal contributions to the whole space are the same.
