Title: Matter as Spectrum of Spacetime Representations

Comments: 37 pages, latex, macros included

Bound and scattering state Schr\"odinger functions of nonrelativistic quantummechanics as representation matrix elements of space and time are embedded intoresidual representations of spacetime as generalizations of Feynmanpropagators. The representation invariants arise as singularities of rationalrepresentation functions in the complex energy and complex momentum plane. Thehomogeneous space $GL(2,C)/U(2)$ with rank 2, the orientation manifold of theunitary hypercharge-isospin group, is taken as model of nonlinear spacetime.Its representations are characterized by two continuous invariants whose ratiowill be related to gauge field coupling constants as residues of the relatedrepresentation functions. Invariants of product representations define unitaryPoincar\'e group representations with masses for free particles in tangentMinkowski spacetime.
