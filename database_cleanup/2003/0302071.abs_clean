Calibration technology provides us with a fast and elegant way to find thesupergravity solutions for BPS wrapped M-branes. Its true potential had howeverremained untapped due to the absence of a classification of calibrations inspacetimes with non-trivial flux. The applications of this method were thuslimited in practise to M-branes wrapping Kahler calibrated cycles. In thispaper, we catagorize a type of generalised calibrations which exist insupergravity backgrounds and contain Kahler calibrations as a sub-class. Thisbroadens the arena of brane configurations whose supergravity solutions areaccessible through the calibration 'short-cut' method.
