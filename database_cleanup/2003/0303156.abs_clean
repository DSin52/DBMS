In this paper we construct the supergravity solutions for the orthogonallyintersecting null scissors and the fluxed D-strings. We name the latter as thesuper-crosses according to their shape. It turns out that the smeared solutionsare U-dual related to the intersecting $(p,q)$-strings. Their open stringproperties are also studied. As a by-product, we clarify the supersymmetryconditions of D2-D2 pairs with most generic fluxes.
