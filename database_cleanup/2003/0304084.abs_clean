Title: Accelerating cosmologies from M/String theory compactifications

Comments: 11 pages, latex, 2 figures, v3

the introduction, other minor changes in the text, note added, referencesaddedWe point out that the solution of $(4+n)$-dimensional gravity coupled to thedilaton and an $n$-form field strength can give rise to a flat 4-dimensionaluniverse (with a scale factor) of the type proposed recently under timedependent compactifications. The compact internal spaces could be hyperbolic,flat or spherical and the solution is identical to the space-like two brane orS2-brane. As has been shown previously for SM2 solution with a fixed fieldstrength we show that for $n=7$ (where the dilaton is vanishing and with ageneral field strength), 6 the corresponding SM2 and SD2 solutions can giveaccelerating cosmologies in Einstein frame for both hyperbolic and flatinternal spaces, thereby meeting the challenge of obtaining such a solutionfrom M/String theory compactifications.
