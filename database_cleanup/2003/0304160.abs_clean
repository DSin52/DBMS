Title: Gauge fields-strings duality and tensionless superstrings

Authors: G.Savvidy

Comments: Latex file, 19 pages

The duality map between gauge theories and strings suggests that when thegauge theory is in the weak coupling regime the dual string tension effectivelytends to zero, $\alpha' \to \infty$. This observation of Sundborg and Witteninitiates a fresh interest to the old problem of tensionless limit of standardstring theory and to the description of its genuine symmetries. We approachthis problem formulating tensionless string theory by means of geometricalconcept of surface perimeter. The perimeter action uniquely leads to atensionless string theory.
