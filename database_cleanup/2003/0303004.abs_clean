Title: Comment on Geometric Interpretation of Ito Calculus on the Lattice

Authors: Naohito Nakazawa

Comments: 9 pages

A covariant nature of the Langevin equation in Ito calculus is clarified inapplying stochastic quantization method to U(N) and SU(N) lattice gaugetheories. The stochastic process is expressed in a manifestly generalcoordinate covariant form as a collective field theory on the group manifold. Ageometric interpretation is given for the Langevin equation and thecorresponding Fokker-Planck equation in the sense of Ito.
