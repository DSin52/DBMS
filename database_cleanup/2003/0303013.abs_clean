Title: Plane waves with weak singularities

Comments: 22 pages, Added references and clarifying comments

We study a class of time dependent solutions of the vacuum Einstein equationswhich are plane waves with weak null singularities. This singularity is weak inthe sense that though the tidal forces diverge at the singularity, the rate ofdivergence is such that the distortion suffered by a freely falling observerremains finite. Among such weak singular plane waves there is a sub-class whichdo not exhibit large back reaction in the presence of test scalar probes.String propagation in these backgrounds is smooth and there is a natural way tocontinue the metric beyond the singularity. This continued metric admits stringpropagation without the string becoming infinitely excited. We construct a oneparameter family of smooth metrics which are at a finite distance in the spaceof metrics from the extended metric and a well defined operator in the stringsigma model which resolves the singularity.
