Title: Charge density and electric charge in quantum electrodynamics

Authors: G. Morchio, F. Strocchi

The convergence of integrals over charge densities is discussed in relationwith the problem of electric charge and (non-local) charged states in QuantumElectrodynamics (QED). Delicate, but physically relevant, mathematical pointslike the domain dependence of local charges as quadratic forms and the timesmearing needed for strong convergence of integrals of charge densities areanalyzed. The results are applied to QED and the choice of time smearing isshown to be crucial for the removal of vacuum polarization effects responiblefor the time dependence of the charge (Swieca phenomenon). The possibility ofconstructing physical charged states in the Feynman-Gupta-Bleuler gauge aslimits of local states vectors is discussed, compatibly with the vanishing ofthe Gauss charge on local states. A modification by a gauge term of the Diracexponential factor which yields the physical Coulomb fields from theFeynman-Gupta-Bleuler fields is shown to remove the infrared divergence ofscalar products of local and physical charged states, allowing for aconstruction of physical charged fields with well defined correlation functionswith local fields.
