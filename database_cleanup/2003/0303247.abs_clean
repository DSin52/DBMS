Starting from an anomaly-free Abelian Higgs model coupled to gravity in a6-dimensional space-time we construct an effective four-dimensional theory ofcharged fermions interacting with U(1) Abelian gauge field and gravity, bothlocalised near the core of a Nielsen-Olesen vortex configuration. We show thatan anomaly free theory in 6-dimensions can give rise to an anomalous theory inD=4, which suggests a possibility of consistent regularisation of abeliananomalous chiral gauge theories in four dimensions. We also show that thespectrum of charged bulk fermions has a mass gap.
