Title: Quiver Gauge Theory and Unification at About 4 TeV

Comments: 16 pages LaTeX with two eps figures. Plenary talk at SCGT02, Nagoya.

Dec 2002The use of the AdS/CFT correspondence to arrive at quiver gauge fieldtheories is dicussed, focusing on the orbifolded case without supersymmetry. Anabelian orbifold with the finite group $Z_{p}$ can give rise to a $G = SU(N)^p$gauge group with chiral fermions and complex scalars in differentbi-fundamental representations of $G$. The precision measurements at the $Z$resonance suggest the values $p = 12$ and $N = 3$, and a unifications scale$M_U \sim 4$ TeV.The robustness and predictivity of such grand unification isdiscussed.
