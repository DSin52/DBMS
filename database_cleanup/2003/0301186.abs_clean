The thermodynamics of type IIB superstring theory in the maximallysupersymmetric plane wave background is studied. We compute the thermodynamicpartition function for non-interacting strings exactly and the result differsslightly from previous computations. We clarify some of the issues related tothe Hagedorn temperature in the limits of small and large constant RR 5-form.We study the thermodynamic behavior of strings in the case of $AdS_3 \times S^3\times T^4$ geometries in the presence of NS-NS and RR 3-form backgrounds. Wealso comment on the relationship of string thermodynamics and the thermodynamicbehavior of the sector of Yang-Mills theory which is the holographic dual ofthe string theory.
