Authors: B. Geyer and P.M. Lavrov

Comments: 12 pages, Latex

We present an extension of previous results (hep-th/0105215)on thequantization of general gauge theories within the BRST-antBRST invatiantLagrangian scheme in general coordinates, namely, we consider the case when thebase manifold of fields and antifields is a supermanifold desribed in terms ofboth bosonic and fermionic variables.
