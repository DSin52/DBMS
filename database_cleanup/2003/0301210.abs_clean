Title: Cosmological background torsion inhomogeneities and Lorentz violation in

QEDComments: Latex file

A non-minimal photon-torsion axial coupling in the quantum electrodynamics(QED) framework is considered. The geometrical optics in Riemann-Cartanspacetime is considering and a plane wave expansion of the electromagneticvector potential is considered leading to a set of the equations for the raycongruence. Since we are interested mainly on the torsion effects in this firstreport we just consider the Riemann-flat case composed of the Minkowskianspacetime with torsion. It is also shown that in torsionic de Sitter backgroundthe vacuum polarisation does alter the propagation of individual photons, aneffect which is absent in Riemannian spaces. It is shown that the cosmologicaltorsion background inhomogeneities induce Lorentz violation and massive photonmodes in this QED.
