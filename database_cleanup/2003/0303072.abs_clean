Title: Nonabelian Phenomena on D-branes

Authors: Robert C. Myers

Comments: Lecture at Leuven workshop on ``The quantum structure of spacetime

and the geometrical nature of fundamental interactions'' (September 13-19,2002)A remarkable feature of D-branes is the appearance of a nonabelian gaugetheory in the description of several (nearly) coincident branes. Thisnonabelian structure plays an important role in realizing various geometriceffects with D-branes. In particular, the branes' transverse displacements aredescribed by matrix-valued scalar fields and so noncommutative geometrynaturally appears in this framework. I review the action governing thisnonabelian theory, as well as various related physical phenomena such as thedielectric effect, giant gravitons and fuzzy funnels.
