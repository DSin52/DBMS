We show that with every classical system possessing first class constraintsthat form a natural Lie algebra, we can associate a superalgebra that admitsthe constraint Lie algebra as a subalgebra. An odd generator of thissuperalgebra that commutes with the constraints is shown to be the BRSToperator whose form follows from a non linear coset representation of thesuperalgebra. We further show the existence of the superalgebra for allYang-Mills theories and for 26-dimensional bosonic strings.
