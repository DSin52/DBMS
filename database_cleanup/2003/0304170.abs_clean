The Skyrme model is considered using the explicit parametrization of therotation group SO(3) by elements of its algebra. Topologically nontrivialsolutions arise even in the one-dimensional case because the fundamental groupof the group SO(3) is equal to Z_2. Static one-dimensional solutions are foundexplicitly and analyzed. There are topologically nontrivial solutions withfinite energy among them. New class of projective models is proposed with atarget space which is an arbitrary real projective space RP^d.
