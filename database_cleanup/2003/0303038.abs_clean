The problem of constructing gauge invariant currents in terms of light-conebound-state wave functions is solved by utilising the gauging of equationsmethod. In particular, it is shown how to construct perturbative expansions ofthe electromagnetic current in the light-cone formalism, such that currentconservation is satisfied at each order of the perturbation theory.
