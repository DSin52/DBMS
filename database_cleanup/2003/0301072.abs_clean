We compute the cosmological perturbations generated in the brane worldinflation driven by the bulk inflaton. Different from the model that theinflation is a brane effect, we exhibit the modification of the power spectrumof scalar perturbations due to the existence of the fifth dimension. With thechange of the initial vacuum, we investigate the dependence of the correctionof the power spectrum on the choice of the vacuum.
