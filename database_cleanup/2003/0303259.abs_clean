Title: On the Equivalence of Phase and Field Charges

Authors: Holger Lyre

Comments: 7 pages

The analysis of the gauge principle as a mere passive symmetry requirementleads to the conclusion that the connection term in the covariant derivative isflat and that local phase transformations are without any empiricalsignificance in analogy to coordinate transformations. Nevertheless, theAharonov-Bohm effect shows the physical significance of the non-trivialholonomy of a flat connection. On this basis the proposal of a new kind ofcharge, the phase charge, is made, understood as the coupling strength of theparticle to the holonomy. The equivalence of phase and usual field charge mustbe tested experimentally in terms of an Aharonov-Bohm effect with muons ortauons, for instance.
