presented and some misprints correctedWe introduce a new map between a q-deformed gauge theory on a generalGL_{q}(N)-covariant quantum hyperplane and an ordinary gauge theory in a fullanalogy with Seiberg-Witten map. Perturbative analysis of the q-deformed QED atthe classical level is presented and gauge fixing a la BRST is discussed
