The vacuum amplitude of the closed membrane theory is investigated using thefact that any three-dimensional manifold has the corresponding Heegaard diagram(splitting) although it is not unique. We concentrate on the topological aspectwith the geometry considered only perturbatively. In the simplest case wherethe action describes the free fields we find that the genus one amplitudes(lens space) are obtained from the S3 amplitude by merely renormalizing themembrane tension. The amplitudes corresponding to the Heegaard diagram of genustwo or higher can be calculated as the Coulomb amplitudes with arbitrary chargedistributed on a knot or a link which corresponds to the set of branch pointsof a given regular or an irregular covering space. We also discuss the case ofmembrane instanton.
