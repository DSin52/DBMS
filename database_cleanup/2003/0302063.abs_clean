We argue that the AdS dual of the three dimensional critical O(N) vectormodel can be evaluated using the Legendre transform that relates the generatingfunctionals of the free UV and the interacting IR fixed points of the boundarytheory. As an example, we use our proposal to evaluate the minimal bulk actionof the scalar field that it dual to the spin-zero ``current'' of the O(N)vector model. We find that the cubic bulk self interaction coupling vanishes.We briefly discuss the implications of our results for higher spin theories andcomment on the bulk-boundary duality for subleading N.
