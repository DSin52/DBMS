Title: Supereigenvalue Model and Dijkgraaf-Vafa Proposal

Authors: H. Itoyama and H. Kanno

Comments: 10 pages, Latex

We present a variant of the supereigenvalue model proposed before byAlvarez-Gaume, Itoyama, Manes, and Zadra. This model derives a set of threeplanar loop equations which takes the same form as the set of three anomalousWard-Takahashi identities on the gaugino condensates recently derived byCachazo, Douglas, Seiberg and Witten. Another model which implements N=2superVirasoro constraints is constructed for comparison.
