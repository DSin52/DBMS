Title: Gauge conservation laws in higher-dimensional Chern-Simons models

Authors: G.Sardanashvily

Comments: 9 pages

Being gauge non-invariant, a Chern-Simons (2k-1)-form seen as a Lagrangian ofgauge theory on a (2k-1)-dimensional manifold leads to the gauge conservationlaw of a modified Noether current.
