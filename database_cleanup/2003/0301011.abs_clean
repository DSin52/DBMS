By performing the matrix integral over the tree level superpotential of N=1supersymmetric SO(N)/Sp(N) gauge theories obtained from N=2 SQCD by adding themass term for the adjoint scalar field, the exact effective superpotential interms of meson field contains the nonperturbative ADS superpotential as well asthe classical tree level superpotential. By completing the meson matrixintegral with the help of saddle point equation, we find the free energycontributions from matter part in terms of glueball field, the adjoint fieldmass and quark mass. By extremizing the effective superpotential with respectto the glueball field, we analyze the vacuum structure and describe theadjoint field mass. We also study the magnetic theory.
