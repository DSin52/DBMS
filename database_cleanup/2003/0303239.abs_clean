We show that the on-shell S-matrix elements of four open string masslessscalars, two scalars and two tachyons, and four open string tachyons in thesuper string theory can be written in a unique form. We then propose anoff-shell extension for the S-matrix element of four scalars which isconsistent, in the low energy limit, with the Dirac-Born-Infeld effectiveaction. Using a similar off-shell extension for the S-matrix element of twoscalars and two tachyons and for the S-matrix element of four tachyons, we showthat they are fully consistent with the tachyonic DBI action.
