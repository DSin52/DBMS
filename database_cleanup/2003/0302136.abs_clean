We discuss the computation of the leading corrections to D-brane solutionsdue to higher derivative terms in the corresponding low energy effectiveaction. We develop several alternative methods for analyzing the problem. Inparticular, we derive an effective one-dimensional action from which the fieldequations for spherically symmetric two-block brane solutions can be derived,show how to obtain first order equations, and discuss a few other approaches.We integrate the equations for extremal branes and obtain the corrections interms of integrals of the evaluation of the higher derivative terms on thelowest order solution. To obtain completely explicit results one would need toknow all leading higher derivative corrections which at present are notavailable. One of the known higher derivative terms is the R^4 term, and weobtain the corrections to the D3 brane solution due to this term alone. Wenote, however, that (unknown at present) higher terms depending on F_5 areexpected to modify our result. We analyze the thermodynamics of brane solutionswhen such quantum corrections are present. We find that the R^4 term induces acorrection to the tension and the electric potential of the D3 brane but not toits charge, and the tension is still proportional to the electric potentialtimes the charge. In the near-horizon limit the corrected solution becomesAdS_5 \times S^5 with the same cosmological constant as the lowest ordersolution but a different value of the (constant) dilaton.
