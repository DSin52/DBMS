In this article we construct the chirality and Dirac operators onnoncommutative AdS_2. We also derive the discrete spectrum of the Diracoperator which is important in the study of the spectral triple associated withAdS_2. It is shown that the degeneracy of the spectrum present in thecommutative AdS_2 is lifted in the noncommutative case. The way we constructthe chirality operator is suggestive of how to introduce the projectoroperators of the corresponding projective modules on this space.
