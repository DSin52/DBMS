Title: World-sheet Stability of (0,2) Linear Sigma Models

Authors: Anirban Basu and Savdeep Sethi

Comments: 18 pages, LaTeX

We argue that two-dimensional (0,2) gauged linear sigma models are notdestabilized by instanton generated world-sheet superpotentials. We constructseveral examples where we show this to be true. The general proof is based onthe Konishi anomaly for (0,2) theories.
