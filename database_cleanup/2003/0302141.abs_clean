Towards describing color confinement, we derive an effective Abelian gaugetheory (EAGT) of a modified SU(2) gluodynamics. The modification is made byexplicitly introducing mass terms of the off-diagonal gluon fields into pureSU(2) gluodynamics, or SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, in order that Abelian dominanceat a long-distance scale is realized in SU(2) QCD. In deriving the EAGT, theoff-diagonal gluon fields involving longitudinal modes are treated as fieldsthat produce quantum effects on the diagonal gluon field and other fieldsrelevant at a long-distance scale. Unlike earlier papers, a necessary gaugefixing is carried out without spoiling the global SU(2) gauge symmetry. We showthat the EAGT allows a composite of the Yukawa and the linear potentials whichalso occurs in an extended dual Abelian Higgs model. This composite potentialis understood to be a static potential between color-electric charges, whoseorigin may be assigned to the gluon fields. In addition, we point out that theEAGT involves the Skyrme-Faddeev model.
