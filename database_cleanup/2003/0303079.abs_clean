A special class of mixed-symmetry type tensor gauge fields of degrees two andthree in four dimensions is investigated from the perspective of the Lagrangiandeformation procedure based on cohomological BRST techniques. It is shown thatthe deformed solution to the master equation can be taken to be nonvanishingonly at the first order in the coupling constant. As a consequence, we deducean interacting model with deformed gauge transformations, an open gauge algebraand undeformed reducibility functions. The resulting coupled Lagrangian actioncontains a quartic vertex and some ``mass'' terms involving only the tensor ofdegree two. We discuss in what sense the results of the deformation procedurederived here are complementary to recent others.
