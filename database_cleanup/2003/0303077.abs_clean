Title: Algebraic Bethe ansatz for the elliptic quantum group

$E_{\tau,\eta}(sl_n)$ and its applicationsAuthors: Bo-yu Hou, Ryu Sasaki and Wen-Li Yang

Comments: 22 pages, latex file, misprints are corrected and references are

updatedWe study the tensor product of the {\it higher spin representations} (see thedefinition in Sect. 2.2) of the elliptic quantum group $E_{\tau,\eta}(sl_n)$.The transfer matrices associated with the $E_{\tau,\eta}(sl_n)$-module areexactly diagonalized by the nested Bethe ansatz method. Some special cases ofthe construction give the exact solution for the $Z_n$ Belavin model and forthe elliptic $A_{n-1}$ Ruijsenaars-Schneider model.
