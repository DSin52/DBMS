Title: Mathisson' spinning electron

symmetry, 66 years agoComments: Final version, published in Acta Physica Polonica 34, 2611 (2003).

Dedicated to the memory of M. Mathisson, J. Weyssenhoff and A. Raabe, whotried to continue to do research during those terrible years of World War II.Revised version. The relation with Schr\"odinger's Zitternde Elektronindicated, and Dirac's Obituary on Mathisson is added. Latex, no figures. 9pagesThe acceleration-dependent system with noncommuting coordinates, proposed byLukierski, Stichel and Zakrzewski [Ann. Phys. 260, 224 (1997)] is derived asthe non-relativistic limit of Mathisson's classical electron [Acta PhysicaPolonica 6, 218 (1937)], further discussed by Weyssenhoff and Raabe [ActaPhysica Polonica 9, 7 (1947)]. The two-parameter centrally extended Galileansymmetry of the model is recoved using elementary methods. The relation toSchr\"odinger's Zitternde Elektron is indicated.
