gluons and quarks'Authors: Andreas Aste (University of Basel)

Comments: 3 pages, LATEX

In a recent paper by Johan Hansson [hep-ph/0208137] it is claimed that thenon-appearance of quarks and gluons as physical particles is an automaticresult of the nonabelian nature of the color interaction in quantumchromodynamics. It is shown that the arguments given by Hansson areinsufficient to support his claim by giving simple counter arguments.
