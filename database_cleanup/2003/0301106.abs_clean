Title: On the Meaning of the String Inspired Noncommutativity and its

ImplicationsAuthors: G. Dourado Barbosa

Comments: sections rewritten, substantial changes, 26 pages

We propose an alternative interpretation for the meaning of noncommutativityof the string inspired field theories and quantum mechanics. Arguments arepresented to show that the noncommutativity generated in the stringy contextought be assumed to be only between the particle coordinate observables, andnot of the spacetime coordinates. Some implications of this fact fornoncomutative field theories and quantum mechanics are discussed. Inparticular, a consistent interpretation is given for the wavefunction inquantum mechanics. An analysis of the noncommutative theories in theSchrodinger formulation employing a generalized quantum Hamilton-Jacobiformalism originated from the polar decomposition of the wavefunction revealeda formal structure for noncommutative quantum mechanics richer than the one ofnoncommutative quantum field theory. Conditions for the classical andcommutative limits of these theories were also determined and applied in someexamples.
