We discuss type IIB orientifolds with D-branes, and NSNS and RR fieldstrength fluxes. The D-brane sectors lead to open string spectra withnon-abelian gauge symmetry and charged chiral fermions. The closed string fieldstrengths generate a scalar potential stabilizing most moduli. We describe theconstruction of N=1 supersymmetric models in the context of orientifolds of IIBtheory on T^6/Z_2 x Z_2, containing D9-branes with world-volume magneticfluxes, and illustrate model building possibilities with several explicitexamples. We comment on a T-dual picture with D8-branes on non-Calabi-Yauhalf-flat geometries, and discuss some of the topological properties of suchconfigurations. We also explore the construction of models with fluxes and withD3-branes at singularities and present a non-supersymmetric 3-family SU(5)model.
