It was generally believed that, in general relativity, the fundamental lawsof nature should be invariant or covariant under a general coordinatetransformation. In general relativity, the equivalence principle tells us theexistence of a local inertial coordinate system and the fundamental laws in thelocal inertial coordinate system which are the same as those in inertialreference system. Then, after a general coordinate transformation, thefundamental laws of nature in arbitrary coordinate system or in arbitrarycurved space-time can be obtained. However, through a simple example, we findthat, under a general coordinate transformation, basic physical equations ingeneral relativity do not transform covariantly, especially they do notpreserve their forms under the transformation from a local inertial coordinatesystem to a curved space-time. The origination of the violation of the generalcovariance is then studied, and a general theory on general coordinatetransformations is developed. Because of the the existence of thenon-homogeneous term, the fundamental laws of nature in arbitrary curvedspace-time can not be expressed by space-time metric, physical observable andtheir derivatives. In other words, basic physical equations obtained from theequivalence principle and the principle of general covariance are differentfrom those in general relativity. Both the equivalence principle and theprinciple of general covariance can not be treated as foundations of generalrelativity. So, what are the foundations of General Relativity? Such kind ofessential problems on General Relativity can be avoided in the physical pictureof gravity. Quantum gauge theory of gravity, which is founded in the physicspicture of gravity, does not have such kind of fundamental problems.
