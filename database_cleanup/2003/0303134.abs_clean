Virasoro GroupAuthors: V.P. Akulov, Sultan Catto, Oktay Cebecioglu and A. Pashnev

Comments: LaTeX, 12 pages

Using the nonlinear realizations of the Virasoro group we construct theaction of the Conformal Quantum Mechanics (CQM) with additional harmonicpotential. We show that $SL(2,R)$ invariance group of this action isnontrivially embedded in the reparametrization group of the time which isisomorphic to the centerless Virasoro group. We generalize the consideration tothe Ermakov systems and construct the action for the time dependent oscillator.Its symmetry group is also the $SL(2,R) \sim SU(1,1)$ group embedded in theVirasoro group in a more complicated way.
