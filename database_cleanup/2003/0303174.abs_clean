Title: Can black holes have Euclidean cores?

Authors: T. Hirayama and B. Holdom

Comments: 14 pages with figures

The search for regular black hole solutions in classical gravity leads us toconsider a core of Euclidean signature in the interior of a black hole.Solutions of Lorentzian and Euclidean general relativity match in such a waythat energy densities and pressures of an isotropic perfect fluid form areeverywhere finite and continuous. Although the weak energy condition cannot besatisfied for these solutions in general relativity, it can be when higherderivative terms are added. A numerical study shows how the transition becomessmoother in theories with more derivatives. As an alternative to the Euclideancore, we also discuss a closely related time dependent orbifold constructionwith a smooth space-like boundary inside the horizon.
