Title: Conformal Invariance and Quantum Nature of Particles

Authors: Hadi Salehi, Yousef Bisabr

Comments: 6 pages, no figure

We investigate a gravitational model whose vacuum sector is invariant underconformal transformations. In this model, matter is taken to be coupled with ametric which is different but conformally related to the metric appearingexplicitly in the vacuum sector. It is then show that the effect of a conformalsymmetry breaking would lead to a particle concept. In particular, acorrespondence between quantum nature of the particles and the gravitationalinteraction of matter is established.
