Title: Holographic dimensional reduction from entanglement in Minkowski space

We present evidence that dimensional reduction in Minkowksi space is inducedby quantum entanglement. First, we show that correlation functions of a classof operators restricted to a sub-volume of D-dimensional Minkowski space scaleas its surface area. A simple example of such area scaling is provided by theenergy fluctuations of a free massless quantum field in its vacuum state. Thisis reminiscent of area scaling of entropy of entanglement but applies toquantum expectation values in a pure state, rather than to statistical averagesover a mixed state. We then show, in specific cases, that the bulk theory inthe sub-volume has a holographic representation in terms of a boundary theoryat high temperature.
