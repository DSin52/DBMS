Title: The Sound of M-Theory

Authors: Christopher P. Herzog

Comments: 1+17 pages, footnote corrected

We consider sound propagation on M5- and M2-branes in the hydrodynamic limit.In particular, we look at the low energy description of a stack of N M-branesat finite temperature. At low energy, the M-branes are well described, via theAdS/CFT correspondence, in terms of classical solutions to the elevendimensional supergravity equations of motion. From this gravitationaldescription, we calculate Lorentzian signature two-point functions of thestress-energy tensor on these M-branes in the long-distance, low-frequencylimit, i.e. the hydrodynamic limit. The poles in these Green's functions showevidence for sound propagation in the field theory living on the M-branes.
