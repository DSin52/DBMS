The wave function renormalization constant $Z$, the probability to find thebare particle in the physical particle, usually satisfies the unitarity bound$0 \leq Z \leq 1$ in field theories without negative metric states. Thisunitarity bound implies the positivity of the anomalous dimension of the fieldin the one-loop approximation. In nonlinear sigma models, however, this boundis apparently broken because of the field dependence of the canonical momentum.The contribution of the bubble diagrams to the anomalous dimension can benegative, while the contributions from more than two particle states satisfiesthe positivity of the anomalous dimension as expected.We derive the genuine unitarity bound of the wave function renormalizationconstant.
