We compute the meson spectrum of an N=2 super Yang-Mills theory withfundamental matter from its dual string theory on AdS5 x S5 with a D7-braneprobe. For scalar and vector mesons with arbitrary R-charge the spectrum iscomputed in closed form by solving the equations for D7-brane fluctuations; formatter with non-zero mass m_q it is discrete, exhibits a mass gap of orderm_q/sqrt(g_s N) and furnishes representations of SO(5) even though the manifestglobal symmetry of the theory is only SO(4). The spectrum of mesons with largespin J is obtained from semiclassical rotating open strings attached to theD7-brane. It displays Regge-like behaviour for J<<sqrt(g_s N), whereas forJ>>sqrt(g_s N) it corresponds to that of two non-relativistic quarks bound by aCoulomb potential. Meson interactions, baryons and 'giant gauge bosons' arebriefly discussed
