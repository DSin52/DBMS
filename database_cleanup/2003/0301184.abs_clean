appear in Phys. Lett. BIn this letter we consider what happens to an M2-brane probe when Minkowskispace is dimensionally reduced to a fluxbrane solution of IIA supergravity.Given that fluxbrane reductions generally break supersymmetry, we look at howsupersymmetry is realised on the D2-brane probe after dualisation. We also showhow to extend this to more general non-linear sigma models.
