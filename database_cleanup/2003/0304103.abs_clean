N=2 closed strings have been recently divided in hep-th/0211147 to two T-dualfamilies denoted by \alpha and \beta. In (2,2) signature both families have onescalar in the spectrum. The scalar in the \beta-string is known to be adeformation of the target space K\"ahler potential and the dynamics is that ofself-dual gravity. In this paper we compute the effective action of the scalarin the \alpha-string. The scalar is a deformation of a potential thatdetermines the metric, torsion and dilaton. The scalar is free and the dynamicsis that of a self-dual curvature with torsion.
