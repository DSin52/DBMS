Title: Reducible representations of CAR and CCR with possible applications to

field quantizationAuthors: Marek Czachor

Comments: Contribution to "New ideas in quantization", XXI Workshop on

Geometric Methods in Physics, Bialowieza 2002, proceedings to be published inJ. Nonlin. Math. Phys., jnmp.cls style package included, typos in vacuumstates correctedReducible representations of CAR and CCR are applied to second quantizationof Dirac and Maxwell fields. The resulting field operators are indeed operatorsand not operator-valued distributions. Examples show that the formalism maylead to a finite quantum field theory.
