Science Publishers, Inc., Hauppauge, NY)I suggest wave equations for the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, andpseudovector fields with different masses for spin zero and one states. Tensor,matrix, and quaternion formulations of fields with two mass and spin states areconsidered. This is the generalization of the Dirac-K\"ahler equation on thecase of different masses of fields with spin one and zero. The equationmatrices obtained are simple linear combinations of matrix elements in the16-dimensional space. Spin projection operators and solutions of equations (forspin one) in the form of matrix-dyads are obtained. The canonical quantizationof fields under consideration is studied. The anomalous interaction of thescalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and pseudovector fields with the externalelectromagnetic field is considered. Three constants which characterize theanomalous magnetic moment and quadrupole electric moment of a particle areintroduced.
