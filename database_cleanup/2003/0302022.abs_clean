Title: Massive Spin-2 Field in De Sitter Space

Authors: T. Garidi, J-P. Gazeau and M. Takook

In this paper we present a covariant quantization of the ``massive'' spin-2field on de Sitter (dS) space. By ``massive'' we mean a field which carries aspecific principal series representation of the dS group. The work is in thedirect continuation of previous ones concerning the scalar, the spinor and thevector cases. The quantization procedure, independent of the choice of thecoordinate system, is based on the Wightman-Garding axiomatic and onanalyticity requirements for the two-point function in the complexifiedpseudo-Riemanian manifold. Such a construction is necessary in view ofpreparing and comparing with the dS conformal spin-2 massless case (dS linearquantum gravity) which will be considered in a forthcoming paper and for whichspecific quantization methods are needed.
