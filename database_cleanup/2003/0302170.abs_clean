Title: Black Hole Entropy from a Highly Excited Elementary String

Authors: Romesh K. Kaul

Comments: revtex, 4 pages

Suggested correspondence between a black hole and a highly excited elementarystring is explored. Black hole entropy is calculated by computing the densityof states for an open excited string. We identify the square root of oscillatornumber of the excited string with Rindler energy of black hole to obtain anentropy formula which, not only agrees at the leading order with theBekenstein-Hawking entropy, but also reproduces the logarithmic correctionobtained for black hole entropy in the quantum geometry framework. Thisprovides an additional supporting evidence for correspondence between blackholes and strings.
