Title: A note on accelerating cosmologies from compactifications and S-branes

We give a simple interpretation of the recent solutions for cosmologies witha transient accelerating phase obtained from compactification in hyperbolicmanifolds, or from S-brane solutions of string/M-theory. In thefour-dimensional picture, these solutions correspond to bouncing the radionfield off its exponential potential. Acceleration occurs at the turning point,when the radion stops and the potential energy momentarily dominates. Thevirtues and limitations of these approaches become quite transparent in thisinterpretation.
