In the SO(N_c) gauge theory with N_f quarks for N_f=N_c-2, its instantoneffects indicate the signal of dynamical flavor symmetry breakdown of SU(N_f)to SO(N_f), which is not described by the conventional "magnetic" degree's offreedom. It is argued that this breaking is well described by our effectivesuperpotential consisting of "electric" quarks and gluons instead of monopolesof SO(N_c). The low-energy particles include the Nambu-Goldstone superfieldsassociated with this breakdown. The proposed superpotential is found to exhibitthe holomorphic decoupling property and the anomaly-matching property on aresidual chiral U(1) symmetry.
