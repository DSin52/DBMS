Authors: Anton V. Galajinsky

and acknowledgements addedRecently it was conjectured by Gibbons and Townsend that the large n limit ofan N=4 superconformal extension of the n-particle Calogero model might providea microscopic description of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole near thehorizon. In this paper a possibility to construct an SU(1,1|2) invariantextension of the Calogero model is considered. We treat in detail thetwo-particle case and comment on some peculiarities intrinsic to n>2generalizations.
