Title: Galois currents and the projective kernel in Rational Conformal Field

TheoryAuthors: P. Bantay

Journal-ref: JHEP 0303 (2003) 025

The notion of Galois currents in Rational Conformal Field Theory isintroduced and illustrated on simple examples. This leads to a naturalpartition of all theories into two classes, depending on the existence of anon-trivial Galois current. As an application, the projective kernel of a RCFT,i.e. the set of all modular transformations represented by scalar multiples ofthe identity, is described in terms of a small set of easily computableinvariants.
