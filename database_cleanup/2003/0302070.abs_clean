Authors: Michael Wohlgenannt

Comments: Plenary talk at XIV International Hutsulian Workshop, Chernivtsi

(Ukraine), Oct 28 - Nov 2, 2002This article provides a basic introduction to some concepts ofnon-commutative geometry. The importance of quantum groups and quantum spacesis stressed. Canonical non-commutativity is understood as an approximation tothe quantum group case. Non-commutative gauge theory and the non-commutativeStandard Model are formulated on a space-time satisfying canonicalnon-commutativity relations. We use *-formalism and Seiberg-Witten maps.
