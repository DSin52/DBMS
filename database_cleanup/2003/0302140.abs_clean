Title: Null-Brane Solutions in Supergravities

Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta

Comments: 12 pages, v2

solutions modifiedWe find a new class of time-dependent brane solutions in supergravities inarbitrary dimensions $D$. These are general intersecting light-like branes(null-branes), and their superposition and intersection rules are obtained.This is achieved by directly solving bosonic field equations for supergravitycoupled to a dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields. We discuss their possiblesignificance.
