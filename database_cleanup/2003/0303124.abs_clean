to be published. Minor correctionsWe discuss tree level three and four point scattering amplitudes in type IIstring models with matter fields localized at the intersections of D-branewrapping cycles. Using conformal field theory techniques we calculate the fourfermion amplitudes. These give "contact" interactions that can lead to flavourchanging effects. We show how in the field theory limit the amplitudes can beinterpreted as the exchange of Kaluza-Klein excitations, string oscillatorstates and stretched heavy string modes.
