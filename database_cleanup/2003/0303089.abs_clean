We consider asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes in $d$-spacetimedimensions in the thermodynamically stable regime. We show that theBekenstein-Hawking entropy and its leading order corrections due to thermalfluctuations can be reproduced by a weakly interacting fluid of bosons andfermions (`holographic gas') in $\Delta=\alpha(d-2)+1$ spacetime dimensions,where the energy-momentum dispersion relation for the constituents of the fluidis assumed to be $\epsilon = \kappa p^\alpha$. We examine implications of thisresult for entropy bounds and the holographic hypothesis.
