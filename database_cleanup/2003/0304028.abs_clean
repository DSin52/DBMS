Renormalization group evolution of QCD composite light-cone operators, builtfrom two and more quark and gluon fields, is responsible for the logarithmicscaling violations in diverse physical observables. We analyze spectra ofanomalous dimensions of these operators at large conformal spins at weak andstrong coupling with the emphasis on the emergence of a dual string picture.The multi-particle spectrum at weak coupling has a hidden symmetry due tointegrability of the underlying dilatation operator which drives the evolution.In perturbative regime, we demonstrate the equivalence of the one-loop cuspanomaly to the disk partition function in two-dimensional Yang-Mills theorywhich admits a string representation. The strong coupling regime for anomalousdimensions is discussed within the two pictures addressed recently, -- minimalsurfaces of open strings and rotating long closed strings in AdS background. Inthe latter case we find that the integrability implies the presence of extradegrees of freedom -- the string junctions. We demonstrate how the analysis oftheir equations of motion naturally agrees with the spectrum found at weakcoupling.
