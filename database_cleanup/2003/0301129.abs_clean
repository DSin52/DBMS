We consider toy cosmological models in which a classical, homogeneous, spinorfield provides a dominant or sub-dominant contribution to the energy-momentumtensor of a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We find that, if such afield were to exist, appropriate choices of the spinor self-interaction wouldgenerate a rich variety of behaviors, quite different from their widely studiedscalar field counterparts. We first discuss solutions that incorporate a stageof cosmic inflation and estimate the primordial spectrum of densityperturbations seeded during such a stage. Inflation driven by a spinor fieldturns out to be unappealing as it leads to a blue spectrum of perturbations andrequires considerable fine-tuning of parameters. We next find that, for simple,quartic spinor self-interactions, non-singular cyclic cosmologies exist withreasonable parameter choices. These solutions might eventually be incorporatedinto a successful past- and future-eternal cosmological model free ofsingularities. In an Appendix, we discuss the classical treatment of spinorsand argue that certain quantum systems might be approximated in terms of suchfields.
