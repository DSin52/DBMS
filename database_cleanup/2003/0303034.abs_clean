We study the dynamical behavior of the dilaton in the background ofthree-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space which is inspired from the low-energystring effective action. The Kerr-de Sitter space describes the gravitationalbackground of a point particle whose mass and spin are given by $1-M$ and $J$and its curvature radius is given by $\ell$. In order to study the propagationof metric, dilaton, and Kalb-Ramond two-form, we perform the perturbationanalysis in the southern diamond of Kerr-de Sitter space including a conicalsingularity. It reveals a mixing between the dilaton and other unphysicalfields. Introducing a gauge-fixing, we can disentangle this mixing completelyand obtain one decoupled dilaton equation. However it turns out to be a tachyonwith $m^2=-8/\ell^2$. We compute the absorption cross section for the dilatonictachyon to extract information on the cosmological horizon of Kerr-de Sitterspace. It is found that there is no absorption of the dilatonic tachyon in thepresence of the cosmological horizon of Kerr-de Sitter space.
