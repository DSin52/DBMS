Title: Accelerating Cosmologies from S-Branes

Authors: Nobuyoshi Ohta

Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures, v2

We point out that the recently proposed model of a flat 4-dimensionaluniverse with accelerated expansion in string/M-theory is a special case oftime-dependent solutions that the author found under the name of ``S-branes.''We also show that similar accelerating models can be obtained from S-branes ifthe internal space is chosen to be hyperbolic or flat spaces.
