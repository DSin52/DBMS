correctionsWe derive the Konishi anomaly equations for N=1 supersymmetric gauge theoriesbased on the classical gauge groups with matter in two-index tensor andfundamental representations, thus extending the existing results for U(N). Ageneral formula is obtained which expresses solutions to the Konishi anomalyequation in terms of solutions to the loop equations of the correspondingmatrix model. This provides an alternative to the diagrammatic proof that theperturbative part of the glueball superpotential $W_{\rm eff}$ for these matterrepresentations can be computed from matrix model integrals, and further showsthat the two approaches always give the same result. The anomaly approach isfound to be computationally more efficient in the cases we studied. Also, weshow in the anomaly approach how theories with a traceless two-index tensor canbe solved using an associated theory with a traceful tensor and appropriatelychosen coupling constants.
