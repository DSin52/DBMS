The timelike boundary Liouville (TBL) conformal field theory consisting of anegative norm boson with an exponential boundary interaction is considered. TBLand its close cousin, a positive norm boson with a non-hermitian boundaryinteraction, arise in the description of the $c=1$ accumulation point of $c<1$minimal models, as the worldsheet description of open string tachyoncondensation in string theory and in scaling limits of superconductors withline defects. Bulk correlators are shown to be exactly soluble. In contrast,due to OPE singularities near the boundary interaction, the computation ofboundary correlators is a challenging problem which we address but do not fullysolve. Analytic continuation from the known correlators of spatial boundaryLiouville to TBL encounters an infinite accumulation of poles and zeros. Aparticular contour prescription is proposed which cancels the poles against thezeros in the boundary correlator $d(\o) $ of two operators of weight $\o^2$ andyields a finite result. A general relation is proposed between two-point CFTcorrelators and stringy Bogolubov coefficients, according to which themagnitude of $d(\o)$ determines the rate of open string pair creation duringtachyon condensation. The rate so obtained agrees at large $\o$ with aminisuperspace analysis of previous work. It is suggested that the mathematicalambiguity arising in the prescription for analytic continuation of thecorrelators corresponds to the physical ambiguity in the choice of open stringmodes and vacua in a time dependent background.
