In the presence of a short-distance cutoff, the choice of a vacuum state inan inflating, non-de Sitter universe is unavoidably ambiguous. The ambiguity isrelated to the time at which initial conditions for the mode functions arespecified and to the way the expansion of the universe affects those initialconditions. In this paper we study the imprint of these uncertainties on thepredictions of inflation. We parametrize the most general set of possiblevacuum initial conditions by two phenomenological variables. We find that thegenerated power spectrum receives oscillatory corrections whose amplitude isproportional to the Hubble parameter over the cutoff scale. In order to furtherconstrain the phenomenological parameters that characterize the vacuumdefinition, we study gravitational particle production during differentcosmological epochs.
