Title: Casimir effect in Domain Wall formation

Authors: M. R. Setare

Comments: 9 pages, 2 eps figures

The Casimir forces on two parallel plates in conformally flat de Sitterbackground due to conformally coupled massless scalar field satisfying mixedboundary conditions on the plates is investigated. In the general case of mixedboundary conditions formulae are derived for the vacuum expectation values ofthe energy-momentum tensor and vacuum forces acting on boundaries.Different cosmological constants are assumed for the space between and outsideof the plates to have general results applicable to the case of domain wallformations in the early universe.
