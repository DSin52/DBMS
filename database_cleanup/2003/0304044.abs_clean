Title: A fresh look at midpoint singularities in the algebra of string fields

Authors: Theodore G. Erler

Comments: 35 pages, 5 figures

In this paper we indulge in a general discussion of outstanding conceptualissues in the operator/Moyal approach to open string field theory, especiallywith regard to the role of singularities encountered in this approach. We arguethat the singularities are not artifacts of the formalism, but persist in anybasis and have a concrete physical interpretation in terms of ambiguities inthe star algebra itself, i.e. associativity anomalies. We also study the freestring Hamiltonian $L_0$ and explain why it must be singular when formulatedalgebraically in terms of the star product.
