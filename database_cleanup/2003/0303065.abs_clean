We explore the phases of N = 1 supersymmetric U(N) gauge theories withfundamental matter that arise as deformations of N = 2 SQCD by the addition ofa superpotential for the adjoint chiral multiplet. As the parameters in thesuperpotential are varied, the vacua of this theory sweep out various branches,which in some cases have multiple semiclassical limits. In such limits, werecover the vacua of various product gauge group theories, with flavors chargedunder some group factors. We describe in detail the structure of the vacua inboth classical and quantum regimes, and develop general techniques such as anaddition and a multiplication map which relate vacua of different gaugetheories. We also consider possible indices characterizing different branchesand potential relationships with matrix models.
