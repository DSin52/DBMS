Title: Non-critical string, Liouville theory and geometric bootstrap hypothesis

Authors: Leszek Hadasz and Zbigniew Jaskolski

Comments: 16 pages, typos corrected

Basing on the standard construction of critical string amplitudes we analyzeproperties of the longitudinal sector of the non-critical Nambu-Goto string. Wedemonstrate that it cannot be described by standard (in the sense of BPZ)conformal field theory. As an alternative we propose a new version of thegeometric approach to Liouville theory and formulate its basic consistencycondition - the geometric bootstrap equation.
