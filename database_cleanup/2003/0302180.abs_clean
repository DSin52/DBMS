Starting from a self-dual formulation of gravity, we obtain a noncommutativetheory of pure Einstein theory in four dimensions. In order to do that, we useSeiberg-Witten map. It is shown that the noncommutative torsion constraint issolved by the vanishing of commutative torsion. Finally, the noncommutativecorrections to the action are computed up to second order.
