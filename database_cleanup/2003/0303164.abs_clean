Authors: Enrique Alvarez, Jorge Conde and Lorenzo Hernandez

Comments: 13 pages, this paper supersedes hep-th/0206140, "A Note on the Bach

Tensor in AdS/CFT",which will be withdrawnThe obstruction for a perturbative reconstruction of the five-dimensionalbulk metric starting from the four-dimensional metric at the boundary,that is,the Dirichlet problem, is computed in dimensions $6\leq d\leq 10$ and somecomments are made on its general structure and, in particular, on itsrelationship with the conformal anomaly, which we compute in dimension $d=8$.
