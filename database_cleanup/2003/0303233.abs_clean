Noncommutative U(N) gauge theories at different N may be often thought of asvacua labeled by an integer parameter N, and the theory in the vicinity of theN-th vacuum coincides with the U(N) noncommutative gauge theory. We constructnoncommutative domain walls on fuzzy cylinder, separating vacua with differentgauge theories. These domain walls are solutions of BPS equations in gaugetheory with an extra term stabilizing the radius of the cylinder. We studyproperties of the domain walls using adjoint scalar and fundamental fermionfields as probes. We show that the regions on different sides of the wall arenot disjoint even in the low energy regime -- there are modes penetrating fromone region to the other. We find that the wall supports a chiral fermion zeromode. Also, we study non-BPS solution representing a wall and an antiwall, andshow that this solution is unstable. We suggest that the domain walls emerge assolutions of matrix model in large class of pp-wave backgrounds withinhomogeneous field strength. In the M-theory language, the domain walls havean interpretation of a stack of branes of fingerstall shape inserted into astack of cylindrical branes.
