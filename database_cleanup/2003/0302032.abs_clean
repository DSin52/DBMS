Title: On the existence of spinning solitons in gauge field theory

Comments: 20 pages

We study the existence of classical soliton solutions with intrinsic angularmomentum in Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with a compact gauge group $\mathcal{G}$ in3+1 dimensional Minkowski space. We show that for \textit{symmetric} gaugefields the Noether charges corresponding to \textit{rigid} spatial symmetries,as the angular momentum, can be expressed in terms of \textit{surface}integrals. Using this result, we demonstrate the non-existence of stationaryand axially symmetric spinning excitations for all known topological solitonsin the case of $\mathcal{G}=SU(2)$, that is for 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles,Julia-Zee dyons, sphalerons and also vortices.
