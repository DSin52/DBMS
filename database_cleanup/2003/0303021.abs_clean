We present a new Lorentz gauge invariant U(1) topological field theory inRiemann-Cartan spacetime manifold $U_{4}$. By virtue of the decompositiontheory of U(1) gauge potential and the $ \phi $--mapping topological currenttheory, it is proved that the U(1) complex scalar field $\phi (x)$ can belooked upon as the order parameter field in our Universe, and the set of zeropoints of $\phi (x)$ create the cosmic strings as the spacetime defects in theearly Universe. In the standard cosmology this complex scalar order parameterfield possesses negative pressure, provides an accelerating expansion ofUniverse and be able to explain the inflation in the early Universe. Thereforethis complex scalar field is not only the order parameter field created thecosmic strings, but also reasonably behaves as the quintessence, the darkenergy.
