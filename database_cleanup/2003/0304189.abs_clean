Title: More on core instabilities of magnetic monopoles

Authors: J.Striet and F.A.Bais

Comments: Latex, 15 pages, 6 figures

In this paper we present new results on the core instability of the 't HooftPolyakov monopoles we reported on before. This instability, where the sphericalcore decays in a toroidal one, typically occurs in models in which chargeconjugation is gauged. In this paper we also discuss a third conceivableconfiguration denoted as ``split core'', which brings us to some details of thenumerical methods we employed. We argue that a core instability of 't HooftPolyakov type monopoles is quite a generic feature of models with charged Higgsparticles.
