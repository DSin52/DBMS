Title: On the existence of finite-energy classical glueballs in gauge theories

with sourcesAuthors: Roman V. Buniy and Thomas W. Kephart

Comments: 3 pages, 1 figure

We show that for classical gauge theories with sources, an initial lump ofgauge and matter fields evolves into either a lump of matter fields with nogluonic content or a configuration where the gauge and matter fields areperiodic in time.
