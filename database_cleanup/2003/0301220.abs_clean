Title: Low energy dynamics of self-dual A_1 strings

Authors: Andreas Gustavsson

Comments: 7 pages

We examine the interrelation between the (2,0) supersymmetric six dimensionaleffective action for the A_1 theory, and the corresponding low-energy theoryfor the collective coordinates associated to supersymmetric selfdual BPSstrings. We argue that this low-energy theory is a two-dimensional N = 4supersymmetric sigma model.
