It is shown that the extra supersymmetry of tensionless superstring and super$p$-brane is accompanied by the presence of new bosonic gauge symmetries.It permits to use composed coordinates encoding all physical degrees offreedom of the model and invariant under these gauge symmetries and theenhanced $\kappa$-symmetry.It is proved that the composed gauge invariant coordinates coincide with thecomponets of symplectic supertwistor realizing a linear representation of thehidden OSp(1,2M) symmetry of the super $p$-brane Lagrangian. A connection ofthe presented gauge symmetries with massless higher spin gauge theories and asymmetric phase of $M$/string-theory is discussed.
