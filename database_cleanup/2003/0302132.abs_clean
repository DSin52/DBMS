addedWe study the properties of anti-de Sitter black holes for various horizontopologies (k=0,\pm 1) and for various dimensions. We explore the thermodynamicand classical (in)stability of higher dimensional black holes with emphasis onthe less well understood k=-1 solution. In particular, we show that thereexists a unique k=-1 extremal black hole solution which has the lowest energyfor all spacetimes in its asymptotic class. What looks encouraging is that theGauss-Bonnet type curvature corrections to the Einstein action not only admitexact solutions but they might be crucial for stability of hyperbolic (k=-1)black holes. This in turn implies that the hyperbolic spacetimes can be stablethermodynamically and classically if the background is defined by an extremalsolution and the extremal entropy is non-negative. For the ground state metrictaken from the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, the gravitational potential can bepositive and bounded from below for a small coupling \alpha~(<<l^2), with $l$being the effective curvature radius of anti-de Sitter space.
