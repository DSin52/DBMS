Some of the recent important developments in understanding string/ gaugedualities are based on the idea of highly symmetric motion of ``stringsolitons'' in $AdS_5\times S^5$ geometry originally suggested by Gubser,Klebanov and Polyakov. In this paper we study symmetric motion of certainstring configurations in so called Pilch-Warner geometry. The two-form field$A_2$ breaks down the supersymmetry to $\mathcal{N}=1$ but for the stringconfigurations considered in this paper the classical values of the energy andthe spin are the same as for string in $AdS\times S^5$. Although trivial atclassical level, the presence of NS-NS antisymmetric field couples thefluctuation modes that indicates changes in the quantum corrections to theenergy spectrum. We compare our results with those obtained in the case ofpp-wave limit in hep-th/0206045.
