Title: Worldsheet Description of Tachyon Condensation in Open String Theory

Authors: Tadaoki Uesugi

Comments: 120 pages. A dissertation presented to the faculty of University of

Tokyo in candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Science, references added,minor correctionsIn this thesis we review the fundamental framework of boundary string fieldtheory (BSFT) and apply it to the tachyon condensation on non-BPS systems inthe superstring theory. The boundary string field theory can be regarded as anatural extension of the nonlinear sigma model. By using this theory we candescribe the tachyon condensation exactly and also obtain the effective actionson non-BPS systems consisting of the Dirac-Born-Infeld type action and theWess-Zumino type action. Especially the Wess-Zumino action is written bysuperconnection and coincides with the mathematical argument by K-theory.Moreover we also discuss the tachyon condensation keeping the conformalinvariance (on-shell). The exact argument by using the boundary state formalismgives a good support to the conjecture of the tachyon condensation and it isalso consistent with boundary string field theory.
