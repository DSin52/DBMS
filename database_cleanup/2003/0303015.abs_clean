Title: Chiral supersymmetric models on an orientifold of Z_4 x Z_2 with

intersecting D6-branesAuthors: Gabriele Honecker

Comments: 21 pages, 5 figures

We investigate intersecting D6-branes on an orientifold of type IIA theory inthe orbifold background T^6/(Z_4 x Z_2) with the emphasis on finding chiralspectra. RR tadpole cancellation conditions and the scalar potential at disclevel are computed. The general chiral spectrum is displayed, and twosupersymmetric models with a Pati-Salam group are shown,one with fourgenerations and the other one with three generations and exactly the chiralmatter content of the SM plus right handed neutrinos.
