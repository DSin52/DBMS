We study Born-Infeld type effective action for unstable D3-brane systemincluding a tachyon and an Abelian gauge field, and find the rolling tachyonwith constant electric and magnetic fields as the most general homogeneoussolution. Tachyonic vacua are characterized by magnitudes of the electric andmagnetic fields and the angle between them. Analysis of small fluctuations inthis background shows that the obtained configuration may be interpreted as afluid consisting of string-like objects carrying electric and magnetic fields.They are stretched along one direction and the rolling tachyon move in aperpendicular direction to the strings. Direction of the propagating wavescoincides with that of strings with velocity equal to electric field.
