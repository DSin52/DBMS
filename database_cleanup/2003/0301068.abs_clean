We present a simple group representation analysis of massive, andparticularly ``partially massless'', fields of arbitrary spin in de Sitterspaces of any dimension. The method uses bulk to boundary propagators to relatethese fields to Euclidean conformal ones at one dimension lower. These resultssupergravity be constructed, at least within its intrinsic horizon?
