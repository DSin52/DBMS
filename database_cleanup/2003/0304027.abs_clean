Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) is a class of theories of relativistic motionwith two observer-independent scales. We investigate the velocity of particlesin DSR, defining velocity as the Poisson bracket of position with theappropriate hamiltonian, taking care of the non-trivial structure of the DSRphase space. We find the general expression for four-velocity, and we showfurther that the three-velocity of massless particles equals 1 for all DSRtheories. The relation between the boost parameter and velocity is alsoclarified.
