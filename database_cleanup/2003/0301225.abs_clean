Title: Supersymmetry on AdS3 and AdS4

Authors: D.G.C. McKeon, C. Schubert

Comments: 13 pages, no figures

We consider a supersymmetric extension of the algebra associated with threeand four dimensional Anti de Sitter space. A representation of thesupersymmetry operators in superspace is given. Supersymmetry invariant modelsare constructed for the superspace associated with AdS3.
