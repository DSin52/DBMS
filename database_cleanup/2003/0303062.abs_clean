A new approach to the inverse scattering problem proposed by Schroer, isapplied to two-dimensional integrable quantum field theories. For anytwo-particle S-matrix S_2 which is analytic in the physical sheet, quantumfields are constructed which are localizable in wedge-shaped regions ofMinkowski space and whose two-particle scattering is described by the givenS_2. These fields are polarization-free in the sense that they createone-particle states from the vacuum without polarization clouds. Thus theyprovide examples of temperate polarization-free generators in the presence ofnon-trivial interaction.
