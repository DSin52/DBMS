Alice electrodynamics (AED) is a theory of electrodynamics in which chargeconjugation is a local gauge symmetry. In this paper we investigate a chargeinstability in alice electrodynamics in (2+1)-dimensions due to this localcharge conjugation. The instability manifests itself through the creation of apair of alice fluxes. The final state is one in which the charge is completelydelocalized, i.e., it is carried as cheshire charge by the flux pair that getsinfinitely separated. We determine the decay rate in terms of the parameters ofthe model. The relation of this phenomenon with other salient features of2-dimensional compact QED, such as linear confinement due toinstantons/monopoles, is discussed.
