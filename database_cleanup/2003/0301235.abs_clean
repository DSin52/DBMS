Title: Higher-Spin Theories and $Sp(2M)$ Invariant Space--Time

Comments: Extended version of the talk presented at the third Sakharov

Conference in Physics, Moscow, 26-29 June 2002; Latex, 26 pages; no figuresSome methods of the ``unfolded dynamics'' machinery particularly useful forthe analysis of higher spin gauge theories are summarized. A formulation of 4dconformal higher spin theories in Sp(8) invariant space-time with matrixcoordinates and its extension to Sp(2M) invariant space-times are discussed. Anew result on the global characterizaton of causality of physical events in theSp(2M) invariant space-time is announced.
