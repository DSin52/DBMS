regularized by higher derivativesAuthors: A.A.Soloshenko, K.V.Stepanyantz

Three-loop quantum corrections to the effective action are calculated for N=1supersymmetric electrodynamics, regularized by higher derivatives. Using theobtained results we investigate the anomaly puzzle in the considered model.
