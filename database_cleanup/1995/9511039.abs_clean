Title: From the Poincar\'e-Cartan form to a Gerstenhaber algebra of Poisson

brackets in field theoryComments: LaTeX file, 11pp

We review the recent generalization of the basic structures of classicalanalytical mechanics to field theory within the framework of the De Donder-Weyl(DW) covariant canonical theory. We start from the Poincar\'e-Cartan form andconstruct the analogue of the symplectic form -- the polysymplectic form ofdegree n+1, where n is the dimension of the space-time. The dynamical variablesare represented by differential forms and the polysymplectic form leads to thedefinition of the Poisson brackets on forms. The Poisson brackets equip theexterior algebra of dynamical variables with a structure of a "higher-order"Gerstenhaber algebra. We also briefly outline a possible approach to fieldquantization which proceeds from the DW Hamiltonian formalism and the Poissonbrackets of forms.
