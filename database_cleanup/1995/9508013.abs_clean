We give a simple geometric description of all formal deformationquantizations on a K\"ahler manifold $M$ which enjoy the following property ofseparation of variables into holomorphic and antiholomorphic ones. For eachopen subset $U\subset M$, $\star$-multiplication from the left by a holomorphicfunction and from the right by an antiholomorphic function on $U$ coincideswith the pointwise multiplication by these functions. These quantizations arein 1-1 correspondence with formal deformations of the original K\"ahler metricson $M$. It has been shown in [Ka] that the formal deformation quantizationsobtained from the full asymptotic expansion of Berezin's $*$-product on theorbits of a compact semisimple Lie group in [Mo2] and [CGR1] and on boundedsymmetric domains in [Mo1] and [CGR2] are those with separation of variablesand correspond to the trivial deformation of the original K\"ahler metrics.
