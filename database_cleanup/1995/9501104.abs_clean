The one--loop determinant computed around the kink solution in the 3D $\phi^4$theory, in cylindrical geometry, allows one to obtain the partition function ofthe interface separating coexisting phases. The quantum fluctuations of theinterface around its equilibrium position are described by a $c=1$two--dimensional conformal field theory, namely a 2D free massless scalar fieldliving on the interface. In this way the capillary wave model conjecture forthe interface free energy in its gaussian approximation is proved.
