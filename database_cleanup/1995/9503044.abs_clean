In the abelian Higgs model, among other situations, it has recently beenrealized that the head-on scattering of $n$ solitons distributed symmetricallyaround the point of scattering is by an angle $\pi/n$, independant of variousdetails of the scattering. In this note, it is first observed that this resultoutcomes. Then, a generalization of an argument given by Ruback for the case oftwo gauge theory vortices in the Bogomol'nyi limit is used to show that in thegeodesic approximation the above result follows from purely geometricconsiderations.
