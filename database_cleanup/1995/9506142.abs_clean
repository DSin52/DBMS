A weaker Haag, Narnhofer and Stein prescription as well as a weaker HesslingQuantum Equivalence Principle for the behaviour of thermal Wightman functionson an event horizon are analysed in the case of an extremalReissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in the limit of a large mass. In order toavoid the degeneracy of the metric in the stationary coordinates on thehorizon, a method is introduced which employs the invariant length of geodesicswhich pass the horizon. First the method is checked for a massless scalar fieldon the event horizon of the Rindler wedge, extending the original procedure ofHaag, Narnhofer and Stein onto the {\em whole horizon} and recovering the sameresults found by Hessling. Afterwards the HNS prescription and Hessling'sprescription for a massless scalar field are analysed on the whole horizon ofan extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in the limit of a large mass. Itis proved that the weak form of the HNS prescription is satisfyed for all thefinite values of the temperature of the KMS states, i.e., this principle doesnot determine any Hawking temperature. It is found that theReissner-Nordstr\"{o}m vacuum, i.e., $T=0$ does satisfy the weak HNSprescription and it is the only state which satisfies weak Hessling'sprescription, too. Finally, it is suggested that all the previously obtainedresults should be valid dropping the requirements of a massless field and of alarge mass black hole.
