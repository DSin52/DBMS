A proof for a non-perturbative C-theorem in four dimensions, capturing theirreversibility of the renormalization group flow in the space of unitaryquantum field theories, has not been accomplished, yet. We test the conjecturedC-theorems using the exact results recently obtained in N=1 supersymmetricgauge theories. We find that the flow towards the infrared region is consistentwith the main proposals for a C-theorem.
