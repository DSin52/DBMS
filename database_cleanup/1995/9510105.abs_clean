to 80 chars/lineIn this paper some quite simple examples of applications of the zeta-functionregularization to superstring theories are presented. It is shown that theVirasoro anomaly in the BRST formulation of (super)strings can be directlycomputed from the original expressions of the operators as well as normalordering constants and masses of ground levels. Hawking's zeta regularizationis recognized as an efficient tool for direct calculations, bringing noambiguities.Possible implications for global GSO operators' phases definitions (maybeensuring modular invariance) will be discussed elsewhere.
