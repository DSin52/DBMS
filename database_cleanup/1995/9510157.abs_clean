The Hamiltonian formulation for a non-Abelian gauge theory in two spatialdimensions is carried out in terms of a gauge-invariant matrix parametrizationof the fields. The Jacobian for the relevant transformation of variables isgiven in terms of the WZW-action for a hermitian matrix field. Somegauge-invariant eigenstates of the kinetic term of the Hamiltonian are given;these have zero charge and exhibit a mass gap.
