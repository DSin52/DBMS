A simple connection between the universal $R$ matrix of $U_q(sl(2))$ (forspins $\demi$ and $J$) and the required form of the co-product action of theHilbert space generators of the quantum group symmetry is put forward. Thisgives an explicit operator realization of the co-product action on thecovariant operators. It allows us to derive the quantum group covariance of thedepend upon worldsheet variables, and obey a new central extension of$U_q(sl(2))$ realized by (what we call) fixed point commutation relations. Thisis explained by showing that the link between the algebra of fieldtransformations and that of the co-product generators is much weaker thanpreviously thought. The central charges of our extended $U_q(sl(2))$ algebra,which includes the Liouville zero-mode momentum in a nontrivial way are relatedto Virasoro-descendants of unity. We also show how our approach can be used toderive the Hopf algebra structure of the extended quantum-group symmetry$U_q(sl(2))\odot U_{\qhat}(sl(2))$ related to the presence of both of thescreening charges of 2D gravity.
