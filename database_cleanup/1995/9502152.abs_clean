The parametrization and gauge dependencies of the one-loop counterterms onthe mass-shell in the Einstein gravity are investigated. The physical meaningof the loop calculation results on the mass shell and the parametrizationdependence of the renormgroup functions in the nonrenormalizable theories arediscussed.
