We investigate the generalized Gross-Neveu model using the discretized lightcone quantization and we find that the vacuum of the bare theory is {\sl non}trivial in presence of vectorial current coupling when the simplest and mostnatural form of quantum constraints is used. Nevertheless the vacuum of therenormalized theory is trivial. In the thermodynamic the Bethe-Salpiterequations which are obtained contain all the terms needed to make them finite.
