Duality transformations with respect to rotational isometries relatesupersymmetric with non-supersymmetric backgrounds in string theory. We findthat non-local world-sheet effects have to be taken into account in order torestore supersymmetry at the string level. The underlying superconformalalgebra remains the same, but in this case T-duality relates local withnon-local realizations of the algebra in terms of parafermions. This is anotherexample where stringy effects resolve paradoxes of the effective field theory.(Contribution to the proceedings of the Trieste conference on S-Duality andMirror Symmetry; to appear in Nucl Phys B Proc Suppl)
