The exact solution for a static spherically symmetric field outside a chargedpoint particle is found in a non-linear $U(1)$ gauge theory with a logarithmicLagrangian. The electromagnetic self-mass is finite, and for a particularrelation between mass, charge, and the value of the non-linearity couplingconstant, $\lambda$, the electromagnetic contribution to the Schwarzschild massis equal to the total mass. If we also require that the singularity at theorigin be hidden behind a horizon, the mass is fixed to be slightly less thanthe charge. This object is a {\em black point.}
