Title: The complete structure of the $WG_2$ algebra and its BRST quantization

Authors: Chuan-Jie

Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX (elsart)

The complete structure of the $WG_2$ algebra is obtained from an explicitrealization by an abstract Virasoro algebra and a free boson field. We thenconstruct its BRST operator and find a seven-parameter family of nilpotnt BRSToperators. These free parameters are related to the canonical transformationsof the ghost, antighost fields which leave the total stress-energy tensor andthe antighost field $b$ invariant.
