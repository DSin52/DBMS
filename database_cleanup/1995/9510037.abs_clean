We construct a transformation that transforms perturbative states into statesthat implement Gauss's law for `pure gluonic' Yang-Mills theory and QCD. Thefact that this transformation is not and cannot be unitary has specialsignificance. Previous work has shown that only states that are unitarilyequivalent to perturbative states necessarily give the same S-matrix elementsas are obtained with Feynman rules.
