We prove the renormalizability of the Curci-Ferrari model with and withoutauxiliary fields using BRST methods. In both cases we find 5 $Z$ factorsinstead of 3. We verify our results by explicit one loop calculations. Wedetermine a set of generators for the ``physical states'', many of which havenegative norm. Supersymmetrization is considered.
