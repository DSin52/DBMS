A lattice regularized Lax operator for the nonultralocal modified Korteweg deVries (mKdV) equation is proposed at the quantum level with the basic operatorssatisfying a $q$-deformed braided algebra. Finding further the associatedquantum $R$ and $Z$-matrices the exact integrability of the model is provedthrough the braided quantum Yang--Baxter equation, a suitably generalizedequation for the nonultralocal models. Using the algebraic Bethe ansatz theeigenvalue problem of the quantum mKdV model is exactly solved and itsconnection with the spin-$\ha$ XXZ chain is established, facilitating theinvestigation of the corresponding conformal properties.
