We construct a new class of $(p,q)$-extended Poincar\'e supergravity theoriesin 2+1 dimensions as Chern-Simons theories of supersymmetry algebras with bothcentral and automorphism charges. The new theories have the advantage that theyare limits of corresponding $(p,q)$ adS supergravity theories and, for not toolarge a value of $N=p+q$, that they have a natural formulation in terms ofoff-shell superfields, in which context the distinction between theories havingthe same value of $N$ but different $(p,q)$ arises because of inequivalentconformal compensator superfields. We also show that, unlike previouslyconstructed N-extended Poincar\'e supergravity theories, the new (2,0) theoryadmits conical spacetimes with Killing spinors. Many of our results on (2,0)Poincar\'e supergravity continue to apply in the presence of coupling to N=2supersymmetric sigma-model matter.
