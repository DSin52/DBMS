Title: Large Conformal Deformations and Spacetime Structure

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX

We demonstrate in detail how the space of two-dimensional quantum fieldtheories can be parametrized by off-shell closed string states. The dynamicequation corresponding to the condition of conformal invariance includes aninfinite number of higher order terms, and we give an explicit procedure fortheir calculation. The symmetries corresponding to equivalence relations of CFTare described. In this framework we show how to perform nonperturbativeanalysis in the low-energy limit and prove that it corresponds to theBrans-Dicke theory of gravity interacting with a skew symmetric tensor field.(Talk presented at the Gursey memorial conference, Istanbul, Turkey, June,1994.)
