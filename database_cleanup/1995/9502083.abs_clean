Color confinement by the mechanism of Kugo and Ojima can treat confinement ofany quantized color carrying fields including dynamical quarks. However, thenon-perturbative condition for this confinement has been known to be satisfiedonly in the pure-gauge model (PGM), which is a topological model withoutphysical degrees of freedom. Here we analyze the Yang-Mills theory by addingphysical degrees of freedom as perturbation to PGM. We find that quarks andgluons are indeed confined in this perturbation theory.
