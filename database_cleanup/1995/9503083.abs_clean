integrable field theories on a half line are discussed at the classical as wellas the quantum level. Only the so-called ``integrable" boundary interactionsare discussed. They are obtained by the requirement that certain combinationsof the lower members of the infinite set of conserved quantities should bepreserved. Contrary to the naive expectations, some ``integrable" boundaryinteractions can drastically change the character of the theory. In some cases,for example, the sinh-Gordon theory, the theory becomes ill-defined because ofthe instability introduced by ``integrable" boundary interactions for a certainrange of the parameter.
