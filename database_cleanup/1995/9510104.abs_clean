We propose the tube model as a first step in solving the bound state problemin light-front QCD. In this approach we neglect transverse variations of thefields, producing a model with 1+1 dimensional dynamics. We then solve the two,three, and four particle sectors of the model for the case of pure glue SU(3).We study convergence to the continuum limit and various properties of thespectrum.
