Using heterotic/type II string duality, we obtain exact nonperturbativeresults for the point particle limit (alpha' -> 0) of some particular fourdimensional, N=2 supersymmetric compactifications of heterotic strings. Thisallows us to recover recent exact nonperturbative results on N=2 gauge theorydirectly from tree-level type II string theory, which provides a highlynon-trivial, quantitative check on the proposed string duality. We alsoinvestigate to what extent the relevant singular limits of Calabi-Yau manifoldsare related to the Riemann surfaces that underlie rigid N=2 gauge theory.
