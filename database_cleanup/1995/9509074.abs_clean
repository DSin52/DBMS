In this paper we examine the classical evolution of a cosmological modelderived from the low-energy tree-level limit of a generic string theory. Theaction contains the metric, dilaton, central charge and an antisymmetric tensorfield. We show that with a homogeneous and isotropic metric, allowing spatialcurvature, there is a formal equivalence between this system and a scalar fieldminimally coupled to Einstein gravity in a spatially flat metric. We refer tothis system as the shifted frame and using it we describe the full range ofcosmological evolution that this model can exhibit. We show that genericsolutions begin (or end) with a singularity. As the system approaches asingularity the dilaton becomes becomes large and loop corrections will becomeimportant.
