We derive the moduli dependence of the one--loop gauge couplings fornon--vanishing gauge background fields in a four--dimensional heterotic (0,2)string compactification. Remarkably, these functions turn out to have arepresentation as modular functions on an auxiliary Riemann surface onappropriate truncations of the full moduli space. In particular, a certain kindof one--loop functions is given by the free energy of two--dimensional solitonson this surface.
