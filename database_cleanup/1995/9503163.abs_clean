Title: Dynamics of $SU(N)$ Supersymmetric Gauge Theory

Comments: 28 pages, harvmac, 4 eps figures in separate uuencoded file. We have

extended this paper considerably, adding new results, discussion and figures.In particular, we give exact formulas for masses and couplings along ascaling trajectory appropriate to the large $N$ limit. These formulas displaya novel effect due to light electric $W$ bosons down to energy scales $\sime^{-N}$, deep in the weak coupling magnetic regimeJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B447 (1995) 271-296

We study the physics of the Seiberg-Witten andArgyres-Faraggi-Klemm-Lerche-Theisen-Yankielowicz solutions of $D=4$, $\CN=2$and $\CN=1$ $SU(N)$ supersymmetric gauge theory. The $\CN=1$ theory isconfining and its effective Lagrangian is a spontaneously broken $U(1)^{N-1}$abelian gauge theory. We identify some features of its physics which see thisinternal structure, including a spectrum of different string tensions. Wediscuss the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, identify a scaling regime in whichinstanton and monopole effects survive, and give exact results for thecrossover from weak to strong coupling along a scaling trajectory. We find alarge hierarchy of mass scales in the scaling regime, including very light $W$bosons, and the absence of weak coupling. The light $W$'s leave a novel imprinton the effective dual magnetic theory. The effective Lagrangian appears to beinadequate to understand the conventional large $N$ limit of the confining$\CN=1$ theory.
