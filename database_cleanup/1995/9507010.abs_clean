The form factor bootstrap approach is used to compute the exact contributionsin the large distance expansion of the correlation function $<\sigma(x)\sigma(0)>$ of the two-dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field at $T=T_c$.The matrix elements of the magnetization operator $\sigma(x)$ present a richanalytic structure induced by the (multi) scattering processes of the eightmassive particles of the model. The spectral representation series has a fastrate of convergence and perfectly agrees with the numerical determination ofthe correlation function.
