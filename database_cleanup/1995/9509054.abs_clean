A discussion of the number of degrees of freedom, and their dynamicalproperties, in higher derivative gravitational theories is presented. Thecomplete non-linear sigma model for these degrees of freedom is exhibited usingthe method of auxiliary fields. As a by-product we present a consistentnon-linear coupling of a spin-2 tensor to gravitation. It is shown thatnon-vanishing $(C_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta})^2$ terms arise in $N=1$, $D=4$superstring Lagrangians due to one-loop radiative corrections with light fieldinternal lines. We discuss the general form of quadratic $(1,1)$ supergravityin two dimensions, and show that this theory is equivalent to two scalarsupermultiplets coupled to the usual Einstein supergravity. It is demonstratedthat the theory possesses stable vacua with vanishing cosmological constantwhich spontaneously break supersymmetry. We then generalize this result to$N=1$ supergravity in four dimensions. Specifically, we demonstrate that aclass of higher derivative supergravity theories is equivalent to two chiralsupermultiplets coupled in a specific way to Einstein supergravity. Thesetheories are shown to possess stable vacuum states with vanishing cosmologicalconstant which spontaneously break the $N=1$ supersymmetry.
