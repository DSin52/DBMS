Gravity coupled three--dimensional $\sigma$--model describing the stationaryEinstein--Maxwell--dilaton system with general dilaton coupling is studied.Killing equations for the corresponding five--dimensional target space areintegrated. It is shown that for general coupling constant $\alpha$ thesymmetry algebra is isomorphic to the maximal solvable subalgebra of $sl(3,R)$.For two critical values $\alpha =0$ and $\alpha =\sqrt{3}$, Killing algebraenlarges to the full $sl(3,R)$ and $su(2,1)\times R$ algebras respectively,which correspond to five--dimensional Kaluza--Klein and four--dimensionalBrans--Dicke--Maxwell theories. These two models are analyzed in terms of theunique real variables. Relation to the description in terms of complex Ernstpotentials is discussed. Non--trivial discrete maps between different subspacesof the target space are found and used to generate new arbitrary--$\alpha$solutions to dilaton gravity.
