A discussion of the field content of quadratic higher-derivative gravitationis presented, together with a new example of a massless spin-two fieldconsistently coupled to gravity. The full quadratic gravity theory is shown tobe equivalent to a canonical second-order theory of a massive scalar field, amassive spin-two symmetric tensor field and gravity. The conditions showingthat the tensor field describes only spin-two degrees of freedom are derived. Alimit of the second-order theory provides a new example of massless spin-twofield consistently coupled to gravity. A restricted set of vacua of thesecond-order theory is also discussed. It is shown that flat-space is the onlystable vacuum of this type, and that the spin-two field around flat space isunfortunately always ghost-like.
