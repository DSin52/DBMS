The standard notion of the non-Abelian duality in string theory isgeneralized to the class of $\si$-models admitting `non-commutative conservedcharges'. Such $\si$-models can be associated with every Lie bialgebra $(\cg,\cgt)$ and they possess an isometry group iff the commutant$[\cgt,\cgt]$ is not equal to $\cgt$. Within the enlarged class of thebackgrounds the non-Abelian duality {\it is} a duality transformation in theproper sense of the word. It exchanges the roles of $\cg$ and $\cgt$ and it canbe interpreted as a symplectomorphism of the phase spaces of the mutually dualtheories. We give explicit formulas for the non-Abelian duality transformationfor any $(\cg,\cgt)$. The non-Abelian analogue of the Abelian modular space$O(d,d;{\bf Z})$ consists of all maximally isotropic decompositions of thecorresponding Drinfeld double.
