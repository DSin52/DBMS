HADRONS --- CONFINEMENT 95 (March 22--24, 1995, RCNP Osaka, Japan), to appearin the proceedings. 9 pages latex, 1 PostScript figure in uufiles format,uses epsf.texAspects of the monopole condensation picture of confinement are discussed.First, the nature of the monopole singularities in the abelian projectionapproach is analysed. Their apparent gauge dependence is shown to have anatural interpretation in terms of 't~Hooft-Polyakov-like monopoles ineuclidean SU(2) gauge theory. Next, the results and predictions of arealization of confinement through condensation of such monopoles aresummarized and compared with numerical data.
