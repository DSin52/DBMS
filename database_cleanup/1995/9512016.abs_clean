If $X$ and $Y$ are a mirror pair of Calabi--Yau threefolds, mirror symmetryshould extend to an isomorphism between the type IIA string theory compactifiedon $X$ and the type IIB string theory compactified on $Y$, with allnonperturbative effects included. We study the implications which this proposalhas for the structure of the semiclassical moduli spaces of the compactifiedtype II theories. For the type IIB theory, the form taken by discrete shifts inthe Ramond-Ramond scalars exhibits an unexpected dependence on the $B$-field.(Based on a talk at the Trieste Workshop on S-Duality and Mirror Symmetry.)
