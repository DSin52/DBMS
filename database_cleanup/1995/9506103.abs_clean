We solve general 1-matrix models without taking the double scaling limit. Amethod of computing generating functions is presented. We calculate thegenerating functions for a simple and double torus. Our method is alsoapplicable to more higher genus. Each generating function can be expressed by a``specific heat'' function for sphere. Universal terms, which are survived inthe double scaling limit can be easily picked out from our exact solutions. Wealso find that the regular part of the spherical generating function is at mostbilinear in coupling constants of source terms.
