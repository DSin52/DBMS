57-69In this paper we introduce a unified approach to Toda field theories whichallows us to formulate the classes of $A_n$, $B_n$ and $C_n$ models as uniquemodels involving an arbitrary continuous parameter $\nu$. For certain values of$\nu $, the model describes the standard Toda theories. For other values of$\nu$ it defines a class of models that involve infinitely many fields. Thesemodels interpolate between the various standard Toda field theories. They areconformally invariant and possess infinitely many conserved higher-spincurrents thus making them candidates for a new set of integrable systems. Ageneral construction is performed, which can effectively be used for thederivation of explicit forms of particular higher-spin currents. We also studythe currents in a different representation in which they are linear in thedynamical variables having, however, a non-linear Poisson bracket algebra. Anexplicit formula for this Poisson structure is found.
