We discuss the use of the variational principle within quaternionic quantummechanics. This is non-trivial because of the non commutative nature ofquaternions. We derive the Dirac Lagrangian density corresponding to thetwo-component Dirac equation. This Lagrangian is complex projected asanticipated in previous articles and this feature is necessary even for aclassical real Lagrangian.
