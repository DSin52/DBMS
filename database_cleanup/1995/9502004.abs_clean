A simple integral representation is derived for the quasiclassical Greenfunction of the Dirac equation in an arbitrary spherically-symmetric decreasingexternal field. The consideration is based on the use of the quasiclassicalradial wave functions with the main contribution of large angular momenta takeninto account. The Green function obtained is applied to the calculation of theDelbruck scattering amplitudes in a screened Coulomb field.
