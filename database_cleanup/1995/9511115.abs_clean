Until now all known static multi black hole solutions described BPS stateswith charges of the same sign. Such solutions could not be related to flatdirections in the space of BPS states. The total number of such states couldnot spontaneously increase because of the charge conservation. We show thatthere exist static BPS configurations which remain in equilibrium even if theyconsist of states with opposite electric (or magnetic) charges from vectormultiplets. This is possible because of the exact cancellation between theCoulomb and scalar forces. In particular, in the theories with N=4 or N=2supersymmetry there exist stable massless multi center configurations withvanishing total charge. Since such configurations have vanishing energy andcharge independently of their number, they can be associated with flatdirections in the space of all possible BPS states. For N=2 case this providesa realization of the idea that BPS condensates could relate to each otherdifferent vacua of the string theory.
