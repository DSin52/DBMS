Based on a model of the d=3 SU(2) pure gauge theory vacuum as amonopole-vortex condensate, we give a quantitative (if model-dependent)estimate of the relation between the string tension and a gauge-invariantmeasure of the Chern-Simons susceptibility, due to vortex linkages, in theabsence of a Chern-Simons term in the action. We also give relations amongthese quantities and the vacuum energy and gauge-boson mass. Both theof linking, twisting, and writhing of closed vortex strings. The closed-vortexstring is described via a complex scalar field theory whose action has aprecisely-specified functional form, inferred from previous work giving theexact form of a gauge-theory effective potential at low momentum. Applicationsto high-T phenomena, including B+L anomalous violation, are mentioned.
