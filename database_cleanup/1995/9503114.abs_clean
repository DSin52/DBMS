An exploratory study of the cosmology of moduli in string theory. Moduli areargued to be natural inflaton fields and lead to a robust inflationarycosmology in which inflation takes place at the top of domain walls. Theamplitude of microwave background fluctuations constrains the dynamicsresponsible for inflation to take place at a higher scale than supersymmetrybreaking. Models explaining this difference in scales and also preventing thedilaton from running to infinity are proposed. The problem of dilatondomination of the energy density of the universe is not resolved.
