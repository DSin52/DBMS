Title: On Hamiltonian and Quantum Dynamics of Massless Particles

Comments: LateX, 21 pages

A short review of special relativistic dynamics describing a particle actedupon by an arbitrary conservative external force is presented. If the mass ofthe particle is zero and the force is central then the equations of motion turnout to be completely integrable. A well-known result. Hamiltonian flows on thetwistor phase space T are constructed which, for conservative forces and valueof the helicity equal to zero, reproduce equations of motion of the classicalmassless particle. For helicities different from zero the same hamiltonianflows produce equations of motion showing a curious "Zitterbewegung" likebehaviour. A canonical Poincare covariant quantization procedure on T issuggested. One simple example describing a spinning and massless 3-D quantummechanical harmonic oscillator is analysed in some detail.
