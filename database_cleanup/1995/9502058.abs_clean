The topological description of $2D$ string theory at the self-dual radius isstudied in the algebro-geometrical formulation of the $A_{k+1}$ topologicalmodels at $k=-3$. Genus zero correlators of tachyons and their gravitationaldescendants are computed as intersection numbers on moduli space and comparedto $2D$ string results. The interpretation of negative momentum tachyons asgravitational descendants of the cosmological constant, as well asmodifications of this, is shown to imply a disagreement between $2D$ stringcorrelators and the associated intersection numbers.
