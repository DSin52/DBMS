We study the non-localization of extended worldsheet supersymmetry underT-duality, when the associated complex structure depends on the coordinate withrespect to which duality is performed. First, the canonical transformationwhich implements T-duality is generalized to the supersymmetric non-linear$\sigma$-models. Then, we obtain the non-local object which replaces thecomplex structure in the dual theory and write down the condition it shouldsatisfy so that the dual action is invariant under the non-local supersymmetry.For the target space, this implies that the supersymmetry transformationparameter is a non-local spinor. The analogue of the Killing equation for thisnon-local spinor is obtained. It is argued that in the target space, thesupersymmetry is no longer realized in the standard way. The string theoreticorigin of this phenomenon is briefly discussed.
