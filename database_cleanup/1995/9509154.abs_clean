Using the Schwinger-Keldysh (closed time path or CTP) and Feynman-Vernoninfluence functional formalisms we obtain a Langevin equation for thedescription of the charged particle creation in electric field and ofbackreaction of charged quantum fields and their fluctuations on time evolutionof this electric field. We obtain an expression for the influence functional interms of Bogoliubov coefficients for the case of quantum electrodynamics withspin 0 charged particles. Then we derive a CTP effective action insemiclassical approximation and its cumulant expansion. An intimate connectionbetween CTP effective action and decoherence functional will allow us toanalyze how macroscopic electromagnetic fields are ``measured'' throughinteraction with charges and thereby rendered classical.
