Title: k-Factorization

Comments: Latex file, 9 pages

I review the k-factorization method to combine the high-energy behaviour inQCD with the renormalization group. Resummation formulas for coefficientfunctions and anomalous dimensions are derived, and their applications tosmall-x scaling violations in structure functions are briefly discussed.
