A geometric description is given for the Sp(2) covariant version of thefield-antifield quantization of general constrained systems in the Lagrangianformalism. We develop differential geometry on manifolds in which a basic setof coordinates (`fields') have two superpartners (`antifields'). Thequantization on such a triplectic manifold requires introducing severalspecific differential-geometric objects, whose properties we study. Theseobjects are then used to impose a set of generalized master-equations thatensure gauge-independence of the path integral. The theory thus quantized isshown to extend to a level-1 theory formulated on a manifold that includesantifields to the Lagrange multipliers. We also observe intriguing relationsbetween triplectic and ordinary symplectic geometry.
