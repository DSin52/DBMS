At the first stage of reheating after inflation, parametric resonance mayrapidly transfer most of the energy of an inflaton field $\phi$ to the energyof other bosons. We show that quantum fluctuations of scalar and vector fieldsproduced at this stage are much greater than they would be in a state ofthermal equilibrium. This leads to cosmological phase transitions of a newtype, which may result in a copious production of topological defects and in asecondary stage of inflation after reheating.
