We discuss the temporal variation of the equation of state of a classicalstring network, evolving in a background in which the Hubble radius 1/H shrinksto a minimum and then re-expands to infinity. We also present a method to lookfor self-consistent non-vacuum string backgrounds, correponding to thesimultaneous solution of the gravi-dilaton backgrounds equations and of thestring equations of motion.
