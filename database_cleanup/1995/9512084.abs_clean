We present unitarity as a method for determining the infinities present ingraviton scattering amplitudes. The infinities are a combination of IR and UV.By understanding the soft singularities we may extract the UV infinities andrelate these to counter-terms in the effective action. As an demonstration ofthis method we rederive the UV infinities present at one-loop when gravity iscoupled to matter.
