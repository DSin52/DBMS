The general correlations between massless fermions are calculated in theSchwinger model at arbitrary temperature. The zero temperature calculations onthe plane are reviewed and clarified. Then the finite temperature fermionicGreen's function is computed and the results on the torus are compared to thoseon the plane. It is concluded that a simpler way to calculate the finitetemperature results is to associate certain terms in the zero temperaturestructure with their finite temperature counterparts.
