The flow of couplings under anisotropic scaling of momenta is computed in$\phi^3$ theory in 6 dimensions. It is shown that the coupling decreases asmomenta of two of the particles become large, keeping the third momentum fixed,but at a slower rate than the decrease of the coupling if all three momentabecome large simultaneously. This effect serves as a simple test of effectivetheories of high energy scattering, since such theories should reproduce thesedeviations from the usual logarithmic scale dependence.
