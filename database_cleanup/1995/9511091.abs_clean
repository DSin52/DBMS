A particular dispersive generalization of long water wave equation in $1+1$dimensions, which is important in the study of matrix models without scalinglimit, known as two--Boson (TB) equation, as well as the associated hierarchyhas been derived from the zero curvature condition on the gauge group$SL(2,R)\otimes U(1)$. The supersymmetric extension of the two--Boson (sTB)hierarchy has similarly been derived from the zero curvature conditionassociated with the gauge supergroup $OSp(2|2)$. Topological algebras arisenaturally as the second Hamiltonian structure of these classical integrablesystems, indicating a close relationship of these models with 2d topologicalfield theories.
