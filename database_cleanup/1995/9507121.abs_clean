Comments: 26 pages

appears in Type IIB superstring theory at points in ${\rm K3}$ moduli spacewhere the Type IIA theory has extended gauge symmetry; a conformal field theorysingularity at such points which may signal quantum effects that persist evenat weak coupling; and the rich dynamics of the real world undercompactification, which may be relevant to some attempts to explain thevanishing of the cosmological constant.
