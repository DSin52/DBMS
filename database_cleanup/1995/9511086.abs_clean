Title: Supersymmetry and gauge symmetry breaking with naturally vanishing

vacuum energyComments: plain LATEX, no figures, 11 pages

We review the construction of $N=1$ supergravity models where the Higgs andsuper-Higgs effects are simultaneously realized, with naturally vanishingclassical vacuum energy and goldstino components along gauge-non-singletrealistic string models.
