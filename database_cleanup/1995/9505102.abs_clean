In the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach to 2D integrable, ADE-relatedquantum field theories one derives a set of algebraic functional equations (aY-system) which play a prominent role. This set of equations is mapped into theproblem of finding finite triangulations of certain 3D manifolds. This mappingallows us to find a general explanation of the periodicity of the Y-system. Forthe $A_N$ related theories and more generally for the various restrictions ofthe fractionally-supersymmetric sine-Gordon models, we find an explicit,surprisingly simple solution of such functional equations in terms of a singleunknown function of the rapidity. The recently-found dilogarithm functionalequations associated to the Y-system simply express the invariance of thevolume of a manifold for deformations of its triangulations.
