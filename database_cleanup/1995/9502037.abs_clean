There is some experimental evidence that some stars are older than the Universein General Relativity based cosmology. In TGD based cosmology the paradox hasexplanation. Photons can be either topologically condensed on backgroundspacetime surface or in 'vapour phase' that is progate in $M^4_+\times CP_2$ assmall surfaces. The time for propagation from A to B is in general larger incondensate than in vapour phase. In principle observer detects from a givenastrophysical object both vapour phase and condensate photons, vapour phasephotons being emitted later than condensate photons. Therefore the erraneousidentification of vapour phase photons as condensate photons leads to an overestimate for the age of the star and star can look older than the Universe. TheHubble constant for vapour phase photons is that associated with $M^4_+$ andsmaller than the Hubble constant of matter dominated cosmology. This couldexplain the measured two widely different values of Hubble constant if smallerHubble constant corresponds to the Hubble constant of the future light cone$M^4_+$. The ratio of propagation velocities of vapour phase and condensatephotons equals to ratio of the two Hubble constants, which in turn is dependson the ratio of mass density and critical mass density, only. Anomalously largeredshifts are possible since vapour phase photons can come also from regionoutside the horizon.
