This is final version to appear in "Proceedings on Geometry &Physics" (proceedings are from workshop in Aarhus, Denmark 1995)The large $k$ asymptotics (perturbation series) for integrals of the form$\int_{\cal F}\mu e^{i k S}$, where $\mu$ is a smooth top form and $S$ is asmooth function on a manifold ${\cal F}$, both of which are invariant under theaction of a symmetry group ${\cal G}$, may be computed using the stationaryphase approximation. This perturbation series can be expressed as the integralof a top form on the space $\cM$ of critical points of $S$ mod the action of${\cal G}$. In this paper we overview a formulation of the ``Feynman rules''computing this top form and a proof that the perturbation series one obtains isindependent of the choice of metric on ${\cal F}$ needed to define it. We alsooverview how this definition can be adapted to the context of $3$-dimensionalChern--Simons quantum field theory where ${\cal F}$ is infinite dimensional.This results in a construction of new differential invariants depending on aclosed, oriented $3$-manifold $M$ together with a choice of smooth component ofthe moduli space of flat connections on $M$ with compact structure group $G$.To make this paper more accessible we warm up with a trivial example and onlygive an outline of the proof that one obtains invariants in the Chern--Simonscase. Full details will appear elsewhere.
