Title: String Cosmology

Comments: Latex file + 3 figures. Talk presented at the 3rd Colloque

Cosmologie, Paris, 7-9 June 95After recalling a few basic concepts from cosmology and string theory, I willoutline the main ideas/assumptions underlying (our own group's approach to)string cosmology and show how these lead to the definition of a two-parameterfamily of ``minimal" models. I will then briefly explain how to compute, interms of those parameters, the spectrum of scalar, tensor and electromagneticperturbations, and mention their most relevant physical consequences. Moredetails on the latter part of this talk can be found in Maurizio Gasperini'scontribution to these proceedings.
