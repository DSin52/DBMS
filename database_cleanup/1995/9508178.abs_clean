Threshold corrections to the running of gauge couplings are calculated forsuperstring models with free complex world sheet fermions. For two N=1$SU(2)\times U(1)^5$ models, the threshold corrections lead to a small increasein the unification scale. Examples are given to illustrate how a given particlespectrum can be described by models with different boundary conditions on theinternal fermions. We also discuss how complex twisted fermions can enhance thesymmetry group of an N=4 $SU(3)\times U(1)\times U(1)$ model to the gauge group$SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$. It is then shown how a mixing angle analogousto the Weinberg angle depends on the boundary conditions of the internalfermions.
