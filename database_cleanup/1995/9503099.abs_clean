Using the topological techniques developed in an earlier paper with Vafa, afield theory action is constructed for any open string with critical N=2worldsheet superconformal invariance. Instead of the Chern-Simons-like actionfound by Witten, this action resembles that of a Wess-Zumino-Witten model. Forthe N=2 string which describes (2,2) self-dual Yang-Mills, the string fieldgeneralizes the scalar field of Yang.As was shown in recent papers, an N=2 string can also be used to describethe Green-Schwarz superstring in a Calabi-Yau background. In this case, oneneeds three types of string fields which generalize the real superfield of thesuper-Yang-Mills prepotential, and the chiral and anti-chiral superfields ofthe Calabi-Yau scalar multiplet. The resulting field theory action for the opensuperstring in a Calabi-Yau background has the advantages over the standard RNSaction that it is manifestly SO(3,1) super-Poincar\'e invariant and does notrequire contact terms to remove tree-level divergences.
