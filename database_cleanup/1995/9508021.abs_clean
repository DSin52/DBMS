We show that S-duality in four dimensional non-supersymmetric abelian gaugetheories can be formulated as a canonical transformation in the phase space ofthe theory. This transformation is the usual interchange between electric andmagnetic degrees of freedom. It is shown that in phase space the modularanomaly emerges as the result of integrating out the momenta degrees offreedom. The generalization to d dimensional abelian gauge theories of p formsis also considered. In the case of non-abelian gauge theories a carefulanalysis of the constraints implied by the canonical transformation shows thatit does not relate Yang-Mills theories with inverted couplings. In fact thedual theory is shown to be of Freedman- Townsend's type, also with ${\tilde\tau}=-1/\tau$, $\tau=\frac{\theta}{2\pi}+\frac{4\pi i}{g^2}$.
