Using the renormalization-group formalism, a sigma model of a special type-in which the metric and the dilaton depend explicitly on one of the stringcoordinates only-is investigated near two dimensions. It is seen that dilatonicgravity coupled to N scalar fields can be expressed in this form, using astring parametrization, and that it possesses the usual UV fixed point.However,in this stringy parametrization of the theory the fixed point for thescalar-dilaton coupling turns out to be trivial, while the fixed point for thegravitational coupling remains to be the same as in previous studies being, inparticular, non-trivial.
