Title: Lorentz-Covariant Analysis of a Quantum Soliton

Comments: Talk given at the XVIII International Workshop on High Energy Physics

and Field Theory, Protvino, Russia, June 1995. 8 pages, LaTeXA set of integral relations for rotational and translational zero modes inthe vicinity of the classical soliton solution are derived from theparticle-like properties of the latter. The validity of these all relations isconsidered for a number of soliton models in 2+1- and 3+1-dimensions.
