The link between the treatment of singular lagrangians as field systems andthe general approch is studied. It is shown that singular Lagrangians as fieldsystems are always in exact agreement with the general approch.Two examples and the singular Lagrangian with zero rank Hessian matrix arestudied. The equations of motion in the field systems are equivalent to theequations which contain accleration, and the constraints are equivalent to theequations which do not contain acceleration in the general approch treatment.
