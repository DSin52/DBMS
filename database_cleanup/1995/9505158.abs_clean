Theory, USC, Los Angeles, march 13 - 18, 1995, 12 pages, LaTexThis is a short review on strings in curved spacetimes. We start by recallingthe classical and quantum string behaviour in singular plane waves backgrounds.We then report on the string behaviour in cosmological spacetimes (FRW, deSitter, power inflation) which is by now largerly understood. Recent progresson self-consistent solutions to the Einstein equations for string dominateduniverses is reviewed. The energy-momentum tensor for a gas of strings isconsidered as source of the spacetime geometry. The string equation of state isdetermined from the behaviour of the explicit string solutions. This yields aself-consistent cosmological solution exhibiting realistic matter dominatedbehaviour $ R \sim (T)^{2/3}\; $ for large times and radiation dominatedbehaviour $ R \sim (T)^{1/2}\; $ for early times. Inflation in the stringtheory context is discussed.
