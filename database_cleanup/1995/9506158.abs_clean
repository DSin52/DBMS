Title: Quantization of Gauge Theories with Anomalies

Comments: Invited Talk at DAE Symposium, Santiniketan, 9 pages, LATEX

In this talk, we briefly review the basic concepts of anomalous gaugetheories. It has been known for some time how theories with local anomalies canbe handled. Recently it has been pointed out that global anomalies, whichobstruct the quantization of certain gauge theories in the temporal gauge, getbypassed in canonical quantization.
