ModelAuthors: T. L. Curtright and G. I. Ghandour

We use time-independent canonical transformation methods to discuss the energyeigenfunctions for the simple linear potential, pedagogically setting the stagefor some field theory calculations to follow. We then discuss the Schr\"odingerwave-functional method of calculating correlation functions for Liouville fieldtheory. We compare this approach to earlier treatments, in particular we checkagainst known weak-coupling results for the Liouville field defined on acylinder. Finally, we further set the stage for future Liouville calculationson curved two-manifolds and briefly discuss simple quantum mechanical systemswith time-dependent Hamiltonians.
