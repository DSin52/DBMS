We analyze (2+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu model with a Thirring interaction,where a vector-vector type four-fermi interaction is on equal terms with ascalar-scalar type one. The Dyson-Schwinger equation for fermion self-energyfunction is constructed up to next-to-leading order in 1/N expansion. Wedetermine the critical surface which is the boundary between a broken phase andan unbroken one in ($\alpha_c,~ \beta_c,~ N_c$) space. It is observed that thecritical behavior is mainly controlled by Gross-Neveu coupling $\alpha_c$ andthe region of the broken phase is separated into two parts by the line$\alpha_c=\alpha_c^*(=\frac{8}{\pi^2})$. The mass function is stronglydependent upon the flavor number N for $\alpha > \alpha_c^*$, while weakly for$\alpha < \alpha_c^*$. For $\alpha > \alpha_c^*$, the critical flavor number$N_c$ increases as Thirring coupling $\beta$ decreases. By driving the CJTeffective potential, we show that the broken phase is energetically preferredto the symmetric one. We discuss the gauge dependence of the mass function andthe ultra-violet property of the composite operators.
