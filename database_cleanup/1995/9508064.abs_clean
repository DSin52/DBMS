Using a $U$-duality symmetry of type II compactification on $T^4$ representedby triality action on the $T$-duality group, and applying the adiabaticargument we construct dual pairs of type II compactifications in lowerdimensions. The simplicity of this construction makes it an ideal set up fortesting various conjectures about string dualities. In some of these models thetype II string has a perturbative non-abelian gauge symmetry. Examples includemodels with $N=2,4,6$ supersymmetry in four dimensions. There are alsoself-dual (in the sense of $S-T$ exchange symmetric) $N=2$ and $N=6$ examples.A generalization of the adiabatic argument can be used to construct dual pairsof models with $N=1$ supersymmetry.
