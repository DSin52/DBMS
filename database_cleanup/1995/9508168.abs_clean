Title: Field Theory of the Electron Spin and Zitterbewegung

Authors: Erasmo Recami, Giovanni Salesi

In a recent paper, we have investigated the classical theory of Barut andZanghi (BZ) for the electron spin [which interpreted the Zitterbewegung (zbw)motion as an internal motion along helical paths], and its ``quantum'' version,just by using thelanguage of Clifford algebras. And, in so doing, we have endedwith a new non-linear Dirac--like equation (NDE). We want to readdress here thewhole subject, and extend it, by translating it however into the ordinarytensorial language, within the frame of a first quantization formalism. Inparticular, we re-derive here the NDE for the electron field, and show it to beassociated with a new conserved probability current (which allows us to workout a ``quantum probabilistic" interpretation of our NDE). Actually, we proposethis equation in substitution for the Dirac equation, which is obtained fromthe former by averaging over a zbw cycle. We then derive a new equation ofmotion for the 4-velocity field which will allow us to regard the electron asan extended--type object with a classically intelligible internal structure.Wecarefully study the solutions of the NDE; with special attention to thoseimplying (at the classical limit) light-like helical motions, since they appearto be the most adequate solutions for the electron description from akinematical and physical point of view, and do cope with the electromagneticproperties of the electron. At last we propose a natural generalization of ourapproach, for the case in which an external electromagnetic potential $A^\mu$is present; \ it happens to be based on a new system of {\em five} first--orderdifferential field equations.
