A method for implementing non-Abelian duality on string backgrounds is given.It is shown that a direct generalisation of the familiar Abelian dualityinduces an extra local symmetry in the gauge invariant theory. The non-Abelianisometry group is shown to be enlarged to a non-semi-simple group. However,upon eliminating the gauge fields to obtain the dual theory the new algebradoes not close. Therefore the gauge fixing procedure becomes problematic. Thenew method proposed here avoids these issues and leads to a dual theory in theproper sense of duality.
