We consider how to normalize the scattering amplitudes of 4D heteroticsuperstrings in a Minkowski background. We fix the normalization of the vacuumamplitude (the string partition function) at each genus, and of every vertexoperator describing a physical external string state in a way consistent withunitarity of the $S$-matrix. We also provide an explicit expression for the maprelating the vertex operator of an incoming physical state to the vertexoperator describing the same physical state, but outgoing. This map is relatedto hermitean conjugation and to the hermiticity properties of the scatteringamplitudes.
