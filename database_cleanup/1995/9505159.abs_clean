We develop a model of $(1+1)$-dimensional parent and baby universes asmacroscopic and microscopic fundamental closed strings. We argue, on the basisof understanding of strings from the point of view of target $D$-dimensionalspace-time, that processes involving baby universes/wormholes not only induce$c$-number "$\alpha$-parameters" in $(1+1)d$ action, but also lead to loss ofquantum coherence for a $(1+1)d$ observer in the parent universe.
