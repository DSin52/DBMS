A superspace formulation for the Batalin Vilkovisky formalism (also calledfield-antifield quantization ) with extended BRST invariance (BRST andanti-BRST invariance ) for gauge theories with closed algebra is presented. Incontrast to a recent formulation, where only BRST invariance holds off shell,two collective sets of fields are introduced and an off shell realization ofthe extended algebra in a superspace with two Grassmann coordinates isobtained. The example of the Yang Mills theory is also considered.
