Dirichlet-branes have emerged as important objects in studyingnonperturbative string theory. It is important to generalize these objects tomore general backgrounds other than the usual flat background. The simplestcase is the linear dilaton condensate. The usual Dirichlet boundary conditionviolates conformal invariance in such a background. We show that by switchingon a certain boundary interaction, conformal invariance is restored. Animmediate application of this result is to two dimensional string theory.
