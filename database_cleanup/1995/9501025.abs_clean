obtained from witte@hybrid.tphys.uni-heidelberg.deOff-shellness and inhomogeneities are in the non-equilibrium dynamics of thelambda phi^4 model are studied using the closed timepath formalism reformulatedas kinetic field theory. We take into account initial correlations up to the4-point functions. The model is shown to exhibit a SO(1,1) symmetry broken byinteractions and initial conditions. The divergence of the correspondingNoethercurrent is calculated and the Ward-Takahashi relations for the brokensymmetry are given. They constitute a set of generalized integrated kineticequations for the general n-point functions. We demonstrate thatenergy-momentum conservation follows from the transport equations. As anapplication we discuss inhomogeneities and general non-equilibrium conditionsin the free field model. In our solution we identify the casimir-effect.
