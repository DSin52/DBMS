A representation of a subgroup H of a finite-dimensional group G can be usedto induce a nonlinear realization of G. If the nonlinearly realized symmetry isgauged, then the BRST charge can be related by a similarity transformation tothe BRST charge for the gauged linear realization of H (plus a cohomologicallytrivial piece). It is shown that the relation between the two BRST charges is areflection of the fact that they can be interpreted geometrically asexpressions for the exterior derivative on G relative to two different bases,and an explicit expression for the generator of the similarity transformationis obtained. This result is applied in an infinite-dimensional setting, whereit yields the similarity transformation used by Ishikawa and Kato to prove theequivalence of the Berkovits-Vafa superstring with the underlying bosonicstring theory.
