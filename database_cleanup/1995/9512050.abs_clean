In a space of $d $ Grassmann coordinates two types of generators of Lorentztransformations can be defined, one of spinorial and the other of vectorialcharacter. Both kinds of operators appear as linear operators in Grassmannspace, definig the fundamental and the adjoint representations of the group $SO(1,d$$-$$1) $, respectively. The eigenvalues of commuting operators belongingto the subgroup $(SO(1,4)) $ can be identified with spins of either fermionicor bosonic fields, while the operators belonging to subgroups of $ SO(d$$-$$5)$ ${\supset SU(3)}$ $ { \times SU(2)}$ $ { \times U(1)} $, determine theYang-Mills charges. The theory offers unification of all the internal degreesof freedom of fermionic and bosonic fields - spins and all Yang-Mills charges.When accordingly all interactions are unified, Yang-Mills fields appear as partof the gravitational field. The theory suggests that elementary particles areeither in the fundamental representations with respect to the groupsdetermining the spin and the charges, or they are in the adjointrepresentations with respect to the groups, which determine the spin and thecharges.
