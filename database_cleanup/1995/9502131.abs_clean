We investigate the phase structure and the infrared properties ofhigher-derivative quantum gravity (QG) with matter, in $4-\varepsilon$dimensions. The renormalization group (RG) equations in $4-\varepsilon$$f\varphi^4$-theory, the $O(N) \varphi^4$-theory, scalar electrodynamics, andthe $SU(2)$ model with scalars. New fixed points for the scalar coupling appearfixed point perturbed by QG leads to a second-order phase transition for thetheory at non-zero temperature. The RG improved effective potential in the$SU(2)$ theory (which can be considered as the confining phase of the standardmodel) is calculated at nonzero temperature and it is shown that its shape isclearly influenced by QG.
