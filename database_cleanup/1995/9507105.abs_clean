A superfield version on superspace $(x^\mu,\theta^a)$ is proposed for the$Sp(2)$-- covariant Lagrangian quantization of general gauge theories. TheBRST- and antiBRST- transformations are realized on superfields assupertranslations in the $\theta^a$-- directions. A new (geometric)interpretation of the Ward identities in the quantum gauge theory is given.
