We obtain a bosonization prescription that allows to represent theenergy-momentum tensor and supersymmetry generators of non-critical superstringtheories with minimal matter as those of topological supergravity. Superstringswith $N=1$ and $N=2$ world-sheet supersymmetry are considered. The topologicalsymmetry associated with the topological supergravity representation isstudied. It is shown, in particular, that the compatibility of this topologicalstructure with the supersymmetry enhances the superconformal symmetry of themodels concerned.
