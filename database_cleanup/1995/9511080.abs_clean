Instanton and seven-brane solutions of type IIB supergravity carrying chargesin the Ramond-Ramond sector are constructed. The singular seven-brane has aquantized \RR \ \lq magnetic' charge whereas its dual is the instanton, whichis non-singular in the string frame and has an associated {\it global} \lqelectric' charge. The product of these charges is constrained by a Diracquantization condition. The instanton has the form of a space-time wormhole inthe string frame, and is responsible for the non-conservation of the Noethercurrent.
