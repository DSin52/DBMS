We give a new proof of the renormalizability of a class of matter fieldtheories on a space-time lattice; in particular we consider $\phi^4$ andmassive Yukawa theories with Wilson fermions. We use the Polchinski approach torenormalization, which is based on the Wilson flow equation; this approach issubstantially simpler than the BPHZ method, applied to the lattice by Reisz. Wediscuss matter theories with staggered fermions. In particular we analyse asimple kind of staggered fermions with minimal doubling, using which we provethe renormalizability of a chiral sigma model with exact chiral symmetry on thelattice.
