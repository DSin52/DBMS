In this paper, we extend previous work on scalar $\phi^4$ theory using theSource Galerkin method. This approach is based on finding solutions $Z[J]$ tothe lattice functional equations for field theories in the presence of anexternal source $J$. Using polynomial expansions for the generating functional$Z$, we calculate propagators and mass-gaps for a number of systems. Thesecalculations are straightforward to perform and are executed rapidly comparedto Monte Carlo. The bulk of the computation involves a single matrix inversion.The use of polynomial expansions illustrates in a clear and simple way theideas of the Source Galerkin method. But at the same time, this choice hasserious limitations. Even after exploiting symmetries, the size of calculationsbecome prohibitive except for small systems. The calculations in this paperwere made on a workstation of modest power using a fourth order polynomialexpansion for lattices of size $8^2$,$4^3$,$2^4$ in $2D$, $3D$, and $4D$. Inaddition, we present an alternative to the Galerkin procedure that results insparse matrices to invert.
