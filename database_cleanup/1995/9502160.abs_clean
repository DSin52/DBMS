Title: Fusion Algebras and Characters of Rational Conformal Field Theories

Comments: 87 pages, AMS TeX, one postscript figure, one exceptional case added

to Main theorem 2, some typos correctedWe introduce the notion of (nondegenerate) strongly-modular fusion algebras.Here strongly-modular means that the fusion algebra is induced via Verlinde'sformula by a representation of the modular group whose kernel contains acongruence subgroup. Furthermore, nondegenerate means that the conformaldimensions of possibly underlying rational conformal field theories do notdiffer by integers. Our first main result is the classification of allstrongly-modular fusion algebras of dimension two, three and four and theclassification of all nondegenerate strongly-modular fusion algebras ofdimension less than 24. Secondly, we show that the conformal characters ofvarious rational models of W-algebras can be determined from the mere knowledgeof the central charge and the set of conformal dimensions. We also describe howto actually construct conformal characters by using theta series associated tocertain lattices. On our way we develop several tools for studyingrepresentations of the modular group on spaces of modular functions. Thesemethods, applied here only to certain rational conformal field theories, are ingeneral useful for the analysis rational models.
