We propose an extension of 't Hooft's large-$N_c$ light-front QCD in twodimensions to include helicity and physical gluon degrees of freedom, modelledon a classical dimensional reduction of four dimensional QCD. Anon-perturbative renormalisation of the infinite set of coupled integralequations describing boundstates is performed. These equations are then solved,both analytically in a phase space wavefunction approximation and numericallyby discretising momenta, for (hybrid) meson masses and (polarized) partonstructure functions.
