Some basic facts about the prepotential in the SW/Whitham theory arepresented. Consideration begins from the abstract theory of quasiclassical$\tau$-functions , which uses as input a family of complex spectral curves witha meromorphic differential $dS$, subject to the constraint $\partialdS/\partial(moduli)= \ holomorphic$, and gives as an output a homogeneousprepotential on extended moduli space. Then reversed construction is discussed,which is straightforwardly generalizable from spectral {\it curves} to certaincomplex manifolds of dimension $d >1$ (like $K3$ and $CY$ families). Finally,examples of particular $N=2$ SUSY gauge models are considered from the point ofview of this formalism. At the end we discuss similarity between the$WP^{12}_{1,1,2,2,6}$ -\-Calabi-\-Yau model with $h_{21}=2$ and the $1d$$SL(2)$ Calogero/Ruijsenaars model, but stop short of the claim that theybelong to the same Whitham universality class beyond the conifold limit.
