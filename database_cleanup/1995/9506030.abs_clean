The statistics of meander and related problems are studied as particularrealizations of compact polymer chain foldings. This paper presents a generaluse of a direct recursive relation for building (semi) meanders (ii) theequivalence with a random matrix model (iii) the exact solution of simplerrelated problems, such as arch configurations or irreducible meanders.
