Title: A comment on the theory of turbulence without pressure proposed by

PolyakovAuthors: E. Elizalde

Comments: Argument enforced, references added, LaTeX file, 6 pages, no figures

Owing to its lack of derivability, the dissipative anomaly operator appearingin the theory of turbulence without pressure recently proposed by Polyakovappears to be quite elusive. In particular, we give arguments that seem to leadto the conclusion that an anomaly in the first equation of the sequence ofconservation laws cannot be {\it a priori} excluded.
