We study N=2(4) superstring backgrounds which are four-dimensionalnon-\Kahlerian with non-trivial dilaton and torsion fields. In particular weconsider the case that the backgrounds possess at least one $U(1)$ isometry andare characterized by the continual Toda equation and the Laplace equation. Weobtain a string background associated with a non-trivial solution of thecontinual Toda equation, which is mapped, under the T-duality transformation,to the hyper-\Kahler Taub-NUT instanton background. It is shown that theintegrable property of the non-\Kahlerian spaces have the direct origin in theand the continual Toda equation imposed on quasi-\Kahler geometry forconsistent string propagation are related to the self-duality conditions of thereal heavens with ``translational'' and ``rotational''Killing symmetryrespectively.
