We quantize the tachyon field in a static two dimensional dilaton gravityblack hole background,and we calculate the Hawking radiation rate. We find thatthe thermal radiation flux, due to the tachyon field, is larger than theconformal matter one. We also find that massive scalar fields which do notcouple to the dilaton, do not give any contribution to the thermal radiation,up to terms quadratic in the scalar curvature.
