We analyze the relation between rigid and local supersymmetric N=2 fieldtheories, when half of the supersymmetries are spontaneously broken. Inparticular, we show that the recently found partial supersymmety breakinginduced by electric and magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos terms in rigid theories canbe obtained by a suitable flat limit of previously constructed N=2 supergravitymodels with partial super-Higgs in the observable sector.
