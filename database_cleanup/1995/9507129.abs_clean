Title: On certain cosmological relics of the early string dynamics

Comments: Latex file, 11 pages, 0 figures. Re-titled revision of "Mixing

towards isotropization..." to appear in Class. Quantum GravityThe tracing of cosmological relics from the early string dynamics may enhancethe theory and provide new perspectives on the major cosmological problems.This point is illustrated in a leading-order Bianchi-type $VII_0$ stringbackground, wherein spatial isotropy can be claimed as such a relic. A muchfiner one, descending from a premordial gravitational wave, could be retrievedfrom its imprint on the small-scale structure of the cosmic microwavebackground. In spite of the absence of conventional inflation, there is nohorizon problem thanks to the presence of an equally fundamental mixmasterdynamics. Implications and certain new perspectives which thus arise for themore general problem of cosmological mixing are briefly discussed.
