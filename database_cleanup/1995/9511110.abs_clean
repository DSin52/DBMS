We compute the effective action and correlators of the Polyakov loop operatorin the Schwinger model at finite temperature and discuss the realization of thediscrete symmetries that occur there. We show that, due to nonlocal effects ofmassless fermions in two spacetime dimensions, the discrete symmetry whichgoverns the screening of charges is spontaneously broken even in an effectiveone-dimensional model, when the volume is infinite. In this limit, the thermalstate of the Schwinger model screens an arbitrary external charge; consequentlythe model is in the deconfined phase, with the charge of the deconfinedfermions completely screened. In a finite volume we show that the Schwingermodel is always confining.
