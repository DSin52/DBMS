Title: The Tolman ``Antitelephone'' Paradox

Authors: Erasmo Recami

Some recent experiments led to the claim that something can travel fasterthan light in vacuum. However, such results do not seem to place relativisticcausality in jeopardy. Actually, it is possible to solve also the known causalrecognized. Here we want to show, in detail and rigorously, how to solve theoldest causal paradox, originally proposed by Tolman, which is the kernel of somany further tachyon paradoxes. The key to the solution is a carefulapplication of {\em tachyon mechanics}, that can be unambiguously derived fromspecial relativity.
