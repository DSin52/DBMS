The intrinsic covariant 1-time description (rest-frame instant form) for Nrelativistic scalar particles is defined. The system of N charged scalarits Dirac observables allows the extraction of the Coulomb potential from fieldtheory and the regularization of the classical self-energy by usingGrassmann-valued electric charges. The 1-time covariant relativisticstatistical mechanics is defined.
