The Thirring model and various generalizations of it are analyzed in detail.The four-Fermi interaction modifies the equation of state. Chemical potentialsand twisted boundary conditions both result in complex fermionic determinantswhich are analyzed. The non-minimal coupling to gravity does deform theconformal algebra which in particular contains the minimal models. We computethe central charges, conformal weights and finite size effects. For the gaugedmodel we derive the partition functions and the explicit expression for thechiral condensate at finite temperature and curvature. The Bosonization incompact curved space-times is also investigated.
