We show that when the Abelian \CS\ theory coupled to matter fields isquantized in a vacuum with non vanishing magnetic flux (or electric charge),the requirement of gauge invariance at finite temperature leads to thequantization of the \CS\ coefficient and its quantum corrections, in a mannersimilar to the non-Abelian case.
