Title: Second-Quantized Mirror Symmetry

Comments: In this slightly revised version, the type II dual of a branch of the

heterotic moduli space obtained by hypermultiplet condensation is tentativelyidentified as a certain Calabi-Yau previously constructed by Klemm andSchimmrigkJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B361 (1995) 59-65

We propose and give strong evidence for a duality relating Type II theorieson Calabi-Yau spaces and heterotic strings on $K3 \times T^2$, both of whichhave $N=2$ spacetime supersymmetry. Entries in the dictionary relating the dualtheories are derived from an analysis of the soliton string worldsheet in thecontext of $N=2$ orbifolds of dual $N=4$ compactifications of Type II andheterotic strings. In particular we construct a pairing between Type II stringtheory on a self-mirror Calabi-Yau space $X$ with $h^{11}= h^{21}= 11$ and a$(4,0)$ background of heterotic string theory on $K3\times T^2$. Under theduality transformation the usual first-quantized mirror symmetry of $X$ becomesa second-quantized mirror symmetry which determines nonperturbative quantumeffects. This enables us to compute the exact quantum moduli space. Mirrorsymmetry of $X$ implies that the low-energy $N=2$ gauge theory is finite, evenat enhanced symmetry points. This prediction is verified by direct computationon the heterotic side. Other branches of the moduli space, and correspondingdual pairs which are not finite $N=2$ theories, are connected to this one viablack hole condensation.
