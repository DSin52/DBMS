We examine the problem of constructing three generation free fermionic stringmodels with grand unified gauge groups. We attempt the construction of $G\timesG$ models, where $G$ is a grand unified group realized at level 1. Thisstructure allows those Higgs representations to appear which are necessary tobreak the symmetry down to the standard model gauge group. For $G=SO(10)$, wefind only models with an even number of generations. However, for $G=SU(5)$ wefind a number of 3 generation models.
