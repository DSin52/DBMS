In the presence of consistent regulators, the standard procedure of BRSTgauge fixing (or moving from one gauge to another) can require non-trivialmodifications. These modifications occur at the quantum level, and gauges existwhich are only well-defined when quantum mechanical modifications are correctlytaken into account. We illustrate how this phenomenon manifests itself in thesolvable case of two-dimensional bosonization in the path-integral formalism.As a by-product, we show how to derive smooth bosonization inBatalin-Vilkovisky Lagrangian BRST quantization.
