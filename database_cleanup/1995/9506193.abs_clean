We present an exact solution of the $O(n)$ model on a random lattice. Thecoupling constant space of our model is parametrized in terms of a set ofmoment variables and the same type of universality with respect to thepotential as observed for the one-matrix model is found. In addition we find alarge degree of universality with respect to $n$; namely for $n\in ]-2,2[$ thesolution can be presented in a form which is valid not only for any potential,but also for any $n$ (not necessarily rational). The cases $n=\pm 2$ aretreated separately. We give explicit expressions for the genus zerocontribution to the one- and two-loop correlators as well as for the genus onecontribution to the one-loop correlator and the free energy. It is shown howone can obtain from these results any multi-loop correlator and the free energyto any genus and the structure of the higher genera contributions is described.Furthermore we describe how the calculation of the higher genera contributionscan be pursued in the scaling limit.
