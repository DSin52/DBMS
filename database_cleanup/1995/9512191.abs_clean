Recently, Witten has proposed a mechanism for symmetry enhancement in$SO(32)$ heterotic string theory, where the singularity obtained by shrinkingan instanton to zero size is resolved by the appearance of an $Sp(1)$ gaugesymmetry. In this short letter, we consider spacetime constraints from anomalycancellation in six dimensions and D-flatness and demonstrate a subtlety whicharises in the moduli space when many instantons are shrunk to zero size.
