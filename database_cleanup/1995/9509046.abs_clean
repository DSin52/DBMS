blocks of text accidentally copied verbatim from papers by V. Zeitlin(hep-ph/9412204 and hep-ph/9507404) and some typos are correctedIn two - loop effective Lagrangian, the low - temperature expansion of the$QED_{3+1}$ with a constant magnetic field and a finite chemical potential isperformed. We then calculate the total fermion density, some components ofpolarization operator and de Hass -van Alphen oscillations. We find that thereis a significant contribution from two-loop expansion to magnetization andfermion density for higher values of chemical potentials.
