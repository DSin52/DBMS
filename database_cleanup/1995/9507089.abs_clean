Title: Quantum Chaos in Multi-Matrix Models

Authors: E.Vinteler

Comments: 15 pages, Latex; 1 figure (available from author )

We propose a possible resolution for the problem of why the semicircular lawis not observed, whilst the random matrix hypothesis describes well thefluctuation of energy spectra. We show in the random 2-matrix model that theinteractions between the quantum subsystems alter the semicircular law of leveldensity. We consider also other types of interactions in the chain- andstar-multimatrix models. The connection with the Calogero-Sutherland models isbriefly discussed.
