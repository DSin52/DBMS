Title: Exact Solutions For Correlation Functions In Some 1+1 D Field Theories

With BoundaryComments: 38 pages, uses harvmac.

We consider 1+1 D theories which are free everywhere except for cosine andmagnetic interactions on the boundary. These theories arise in dissipativequantum systems, open string theory, and, in special cases, tunneling inquantum Hall systems. These boundary systems satisfy an approximate SL(2,Z)symmetry as a function of flux per unit cell and dissipation. At specialmulticritical points, they also satisfy a set of reparametrization Wardidentities and have homogeneous, piecewise-linear correlation functions inmomentum space. In this paper, we use these symmetries to find exact solutionsfor some of the correlation functions. We also comment on the form of thecorrelation functions in general, and verify that the SL(2,Z) dualitytransformation between different critical points is satisfied exactly in allcases where the full solution is known.
