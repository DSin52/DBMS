We examine the two-point correlation functions of the fields exp(i$\alpha\Phi$)in the sine-Gordon theory at all values of the coupling constant $\hat\beta$.Using conformal perturbation theory, we write down explicit integralexpressions for every order of the short distance expansion. Using anovel technique analagous to dimensional regularisation, we evaluate theseintegrals for the first few orders finding expressions in terms of generalisedhypergeometric functions. From these derived expressions, we examine thelimiting forms at the points where the sine-Gordon theory maps onto a doubledIsing and the Gross-Neveu SU(2) models. In this way we recover the knownexpansions of the spin and disorder fields about criticality in the Ising modeland the well known Kosterlitz-Thouless flows in the Gross-Neveu SU(2) model.
