Title: A General Relativistic Model for Confinement in SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory

Comments: 17 pages LaTeX

In this paper we present a model of confinement based on an analogy with theconfinement mechanism of the Schwarzschild solution of general relativity.Using recently discovered exact, Schwarzschild-like solutions of the SU(2)Yang-Mills-Higgs equations we study the behaviour of a scalar, SU(2) chargedtest particle placed in the gauge fields of this solution. We find that thistest particle is indeed confined inside the color event horizon of oursolution. Additionally it is found that this system is a composite fermion eventhough there are no fundamental fermions in the original Lagrangian.
