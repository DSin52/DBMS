We present the explicit form for all the four dimensional, static,spherically symmetric solutions in $(4+n)$-d Abelian Kaluza-Klein theory byperforming a subset of $SO(2,n)$ transformations corresponding to four$SO(1,1)$ boosts on the Schwarzschild solution, supplemented by $SO(n)/SO(n-2)$transformations. The solutions are parameterized by the mass $M$, Taub-Nutcharge $a$, $n$ electric $\vec{\cal Q}$ and $n$ magnetic $\vec{\cal P}$charges. Non-extreme black holes (with zero Taub-NUT charge) have either theReissner-Nordstr\" om or Schwarzschild global space-time. Supersymmetricextreme black holes have a null or naked singularity, while non-supersymmetricextreme ones have a global space-time of extreme Reissner-Nordstr\" om blackholes.
