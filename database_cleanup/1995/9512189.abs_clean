I present the moduli space of the (2+2)-dimensional critical closed fermionicstring with two world-sheet supersymmetries. The integration of fermionic andMaxwell moduli in the presence of punctures yields the string measure forn-point amplitudes at arbitrary genus and instanton number. Generalizedpicture-changing and spectral-flow operators emerge, connecting differentinstanton sectors. Tree and loop amplitudes are computed.
