At the very early Universe the matter fields are described by the GUT modelsin curved space-time. At high energies these fields are asymptotically free andconformally coupled to external metric. The only possible quantum effect is theappearance of the conformal anomaly, which leads to the propagation of the newdegree of freedom - conformal factor. Simultaneously with the expansion of theUniverse, the scale of energies decreases and the propagating conformal factorstarts to interact with the Higgs field due to the violation of conformalinvariance in the matter fields sector. In a previous paper \cite{foo} we haveshown that this interaction can lead to special physical effects like therenormalization group flow, which ends in some fixed point. Furthermore in thevicinity of this fixed point there occur the first order phase transitions. Inthe present paper we consider the same theory of conformal factor coupled toHiggs field and incorporate the temperature effects. We reduce the complicatedhigher-derivative operator to several ones of the standard second-derivativeform and calculate an exact effective potential with temperature on the anti deSitter (AdS) background.
