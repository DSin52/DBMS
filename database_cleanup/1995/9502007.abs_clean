The dynamics of the early universe may have been profoundly influenced byspatial anisotropies. A search for such backgrounds in the context of stringcosmology has uncovered the existence of an entire class of (spatatially)homogeneous but not necessarily isotropic space-times, analogous to the classof Bianchi-types in general relativity. Configurations with vanishingcosmological constant but non-vanishing dilaton and antisymmetric field areexplicitly found for all types. This is a new class of solutions, whoseisotropy limits reproduce all known and, further, all possible FRW-type ofmodels in the string-cosmology context considered. There is always an initialsingularity and no inflation. Other features of the general solutions,including their behaviour under abelian duality are are also discussed.
