Title: On the U(1)-Problem of QED_2

Comments: Seminar talk given at the 1995 Schladming winter-school (to appear in

the proceedings), 7 pages, Latex2eQED_2 with mass and flavor has in common many features with QCD, and thus isan interesting toy model relevant for four dimensional physics. The model isconstructed using Euclidean path integrals and mass perturbation series. Thevacuum functional is carefully decomposed into clustering states being theanalogue of the theta-vacuum of QCD. Finally the clustering theory can bemapped onto a generalized Sine-Gordon model. Having at hand this bosonizedversion, several lessons on the theta-vacuum, the U(1)-problem andWitten-Veneziano-type formulas will be drawn. This sheds light on thecorresponding structures of QCD.
