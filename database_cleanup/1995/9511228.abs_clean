We study a class of four-dimensional N=1 heterotic string theories which havenontrivial quantum dynamics arising from asymptotically free gauge groups.These models are obtained by orbifolding 4d N=2 heterotic/type II dual pairs bysymmetries which leave unbroken products of nonabelian gauge groups (withoutcharged matter) in a ``hidden sector'' on the heterotic side. Such models areexpected to break supersymmetry through gaugino condensation in the hiddensector. We find a dual description of the effects of gaugino condensation onthe type II side, where the corresponding superpotential arises at tree level.We speculate that the conformal field theory underlying the type II descriptionmay be related to a class of geometrical nonsupersymmetric stringcompactifications.
