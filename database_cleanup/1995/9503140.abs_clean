Consequences of a symmetry, e.g.\ relations amongst Green functions, arerenormalization scheme independently expressed in terms of a rigid Wardidentity. The corresponding local version yields information on the respectivecurrent. In the case of spontaneous breakdown one has to define the theory viathe BRS invariance and thus to construct rigid and current Ward identitynon-trivially in accordance with it. We performed this construction to allorders of perturbation theory in the abelian Higgs model as a prelude to thestandard model. A technical tool of interest in itself is the use of a doubletof external scalar ``background'' fields. The Callan-Symanzik equation has aninteresting form and follows easily once the rigid invariance is established.
