We describe three different methods for generating quasi-exactly solvablepotentials, for which a finite number of eigenstates are analytically known.The three methods are respectively based on (i) a polynomial ansatz for wavefunctions; (ii) point canonical transformations; (iii) supersymmetric quantummechanics. The methods are rather general and give considerably richer resultsthan those available in the current literature.
