We write down the weak-coupling limit of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theorywith arbitrary gauge group \( G \). We find the weak-coupling monodromiesrepresented in terms of \( Sp(2r,\bzeta ) \) matrices depending on paths closedup to Weyl transformations in the Cartan space of complex dimension r, the rankof the group. There is a one to one relation between Weyl orbits of these pathsand elements of a generalized braid group defined from \( G \). We check thatthese weak-coupling monodromies behave correctly in limits of the moduli spacecorresponding to restrictions to subgroups. In the case of $SO(2r+1)$ we writedown the complex curve representing the solution of the theory. We show thatthe curve has the correct monodromies.
