The $\Delta$-operator of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism is the HamiltonianBRST charge of Abelian shift transformations in the ghost momentumrepresentation. We generalize this $\Delta$-operator, and its associatedhierarchy of antibrackets, to that of an arbitrary non-Abelian and possiblyopen algebra of any rank. We comment on the possible application of thisformalism to closed string field theory.
