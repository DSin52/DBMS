Comments: 10 pages. LATEX. Submitted to Proc. of the "SUSY-95" International

Conference, Paris, France, 1995, May 15-19Two approaches concerning the connection of the fermionic kappa -- symmetrywith the superstring world -- sheet superdiffeomorphism transformations arediscussed. The first approach is based on the twistor -- like formulation ofthe superstring action and the second one on a reformulation of the superstringand super~-~p~-~brane actions according to the Generalized Action Principle.
