paper, including figures, is also available via WWW at`Non-perturbative approaches to QCD' workshop at ECT* in Trento, July 10 -We study a field--theoretical analogue of the Aharonov--Bohm effect in theto the linking number of the Abrikosov--Nielsen--Olesen string world sheets andthe particle world trajectory. The creation operators of the strings areexplicitly constructed in the path integral and in the Hamiltonian formulationof the theory. We show that the Aharonov--Bohm effect gives rise to severalnontrivial commutation relations. We also study the Aharonov--Bohm effect inthe lattice formulation of the Abelian Higgs Model. It occurs that this effectgives rise to a nontrivial interaction of tested charged particles.
