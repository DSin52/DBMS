Lavelle-McMullan symmetry of QED is examined at classical and quantum levels.It is shown that Lavelle-McMullan symmetry does not give any new non-trivialinformation in QED by examining the Ward-Takahashi identities. Being inspiredby the examination of Ward-Takahashi identity, we construct the generalizednon-local and non-covariant symmetries of QED.
