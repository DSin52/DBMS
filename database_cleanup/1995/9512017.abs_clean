The action of the $S$-duality $Sl(2,Z)$ group on the moduli of the Calabi-Yaumanifold $W\IP^{12}_{11226}$ appearing in the rank two dual pair $(K^{3}\timesT^{2}/W\IP^{12}_{11226})$ is defined by interpreting the $N\!=\!4$ to $N\!=\!2$flow, for $SU(2)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills, in terms of the Calabi-Yau moduli.The different singularity loci are mapped in a one to one way, and the($N\!=\!2$ limit/point particle limit) is obtained in both cases by the sametype of blow up. Moreover, it is shown that the $S$-duality group permutes thedifferent singularity loci of the moduli of $W\IP^{12}_{11226}$. We study thetransformation under $S$-duality of the Calabi-Yau Yukawa couplings.
