Title: Exchange statistics in 1D

Comments: A few formulae are corrected. A new formula for the generation

function is addedWe show that the exchange statistics have consequences in 1D systems withcompact topology, contrary to the common opinion that exchange statistics isarbitrary in 1D. As examples of non-trivial statistical behavior we exactlycalculate the partition function and correlators for systems of freeq-particles on compactified chains using functional integral techniques and thesupersymmetric trick. In particular we consider a spin 1/2 XY-chain withperiodic boundary conditions that corresponds to the case of q=-1.
