Corrected versionSome new developments in constrained Lax integrable systems and theirapplications to physics are reviewed. After summarizing the tau functionconstruction of the KP hierarchy and the basic concepts of the symmetry ofnonlinear equations, more recent ideas dealing with constrained KP models aredescribed. A unifying approach to constrained KP hierarchy based on graded$SL(r+n,n)$ algebra is presented and equivalence formulas are obtained forvarious pseudo-differential Lax operators appearing in this context. It is thenshown how the Toda lattice structure emerges from constrained KP models viacanonical Darboux-B\"{a}cklund transformations. These transformations enable usto find simple Wronskian solutions for the underlying tau-functions. We alsoestablish a relation between two-matrix models and constrained Toda latticesystems and derive from this relation expressions for the correspondingpartition function.
