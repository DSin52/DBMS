Title: DYNAMICAL SUPERSYMMETRY

Comments: 7 pages, plain TeX

We show, in a simple quantum mechanical model, how a theory can becomesupersymmetric in the presence of interactions even when the free theory isnot. This dynamical generation of supersymmetry relaxes the condition on theequality of masses of the superpartners which would be of phenomenologicalinterest.
