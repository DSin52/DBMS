In this paper we construct a $(2,2)$ dimensional string theory with manifest$N=1$ spacetime supersymmetry. We use Berkovits' approach of augmenting thespacetime supercoordinates by the conjugate momenta for the fermionicvariables. The worldsheet symmetry algebra is a twisted and truncated ``small''$N=4$ superconformal algebra. The realisation of the symmetry algebra isreducible with an infinite order of reducibility. We study the physical statesof the theory by two different methods. In one of them, we identify a subset ofirreducible constraints, which is by itself critical. We construct the BRSToperator for the irreducible constraints, and study the cohomology andinteractions. This method breaks the $SO(2,2)$ spacetime symmetry of theoriginal reducible theory. In another approach, we study the theory in a fullycovariant manner, which involves the introduction of infinitely many ghosts forghosts.
