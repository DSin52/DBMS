We reformulate the self-dual Einstein equation as a trio of differential formequations for simple two-forms. Using them, we can quickly show the equivalenceof the theory and 2D sigma models valued in an infinite-dimensional group,which was shown by Park and Husain earlier. We also derive other field theoriesincluding the 2D Higgs bundle equation. This formulation elucidates therelation among those field theories.
