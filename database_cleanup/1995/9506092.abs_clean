The principles of finiteness and reduction of couplings can be applied toachieve Gauge-Yukawa Unification. It is found that the observed top-bottomhierarchy and the top quark mass naturally follow if there exists Gauge-YukawaUnification which is a simple functional relation among the gauge coupling andthe Yukawa couplings of the third generation in various susy unified gaugemodels. We briefly outline the basic idea of these principles and present themain results of the Gauge-Yukawa Unified models that have recently been studiedin detail.
