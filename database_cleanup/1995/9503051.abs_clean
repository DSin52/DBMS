In the present article we analyze the problem of a relativistic Dirac electronin the presence of a combination of a Coulomb field, a $1/r$ scalar potentialas well as a Dirac magnetic monopole and an Aharonov-Bohm potential. Using thealgebraic method of separation of variables, the Dirac equation expressed inthe local rotating diagonal gauge is completely separated in sphericalcoordinates, and exact solutions are obtained. We compute the energy spectrumand analyze how it depends on the intensity of the Aharonov-Bohm and themagnetic monopole strengths.
