We discuss the renormalization group improved effective action and runningsurface couplings in curved spacetime with boundary. Using scalarself-interacting theory as an example, we study the influence of the boundaryeffects to effective equations of motion in spherical cap and the relevance ofsurface running couplings to quantum cosmology and symmetry breakingphenomenon. Running surface couplings in the asymptotically free SU(2) gaugetheory are found.
