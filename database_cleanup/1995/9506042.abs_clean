Techniques are presented for calculating directly the scalar functionaldeterminant on the Euclidean d-ball. General formulae are given for Dirichletand Robin boundary conditions. The method involves a large mass asymptoticlimit which is carried out in detail for d=2 and d=4 incidentally producingsome specific summations and identities. Extensive use is made of theWatson-Kober summation formula.
