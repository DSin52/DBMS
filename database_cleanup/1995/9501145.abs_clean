Analysis of the WKB exactness in some homogeneous spaces is attempted. $CP^N$as well as its noncompact counterpart $D_{N,1}$ is studied. $U(N+1)$ or U(N,1)based on the Schwinger bosons leads us to $CP^N$ or $D_{N,1}$ path integralexpression for the quantity, ${\rm tr} e^{-iHT}$, with the aid of coherentstates. The WKB approximation terminates in the leading order and yields theexact result provided that the Hamiltonian is given by a bilinear form of thecreation and the annihilation operators. An argument on the WKB exactness tomore general cases is also made.
