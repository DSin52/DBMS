We consider adjoint scalar matter coupled to QCD(1+1) in light-conequantization on a finite `interval' with periodic boundary conditions. We workwith the gauge group SU(2) which is modified to ${\rm{SU(2)/Z_2}}$ by thenon-trivial topology. The model is interesting for various nonperturbativeapproaches because it is the sector of zero transverse momentum gluons of pureglue QCD(2+1), where the scalar field is the remnant of the transverse gluoncomponent. We use the Hamiltonian formalism in the gauge $\partial_- A^+ = 0$.What survives is the dynamical zero mode of $A^+$, which in other theoriesgives topological structure and degenerate vacua. With a point-splittingregularization designed to preserve symmetry under large gauge transformations,an extra $A^+$ dependent term appears in the current $J^+$. This is reminiscentof an (unwanted) anomaly. In particular, the gauge invariant charge and thesimilarly regulated $P^+$ no longer commute with the Hamiltonian. We show thatnonetheless one can construct physical states of definite momentum which arenot {\it invariant} under large gauge transformations but do {\it transform} ina well-defined way. As well, in the physical subspace we recover vanishing {\itexpectation values} of the commutators between the gauge invariant charge,momentum and Hamiltonian operators. It is argued that in this theory the vacuumis nonetheless trivial and the spectrum is consistent with the results ofothers who have treated the large N, SU(N), version of this theory in thecontinuum limit.
