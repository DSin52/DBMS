Some general formulas are derived for the solutions of a BRST quantization oninner product spaces of finite dimensional bosonic gauge theories invariantunder arbitrary Lie groups. A detailed analysis is then performed of SL(2,R)invariant models and some possible geometries of the Lagrange multipliers arederived together with explicit results for a class of SL(2,R) models. Gaugemodels invariant under a nonunimodular gauge group are also studied in somedetail.
