We discuss the two-dimensional (2D), $\epsilon<2$ extremal ground states ofcharged black hole. Here $\epsilon$ is the dilaton coupling parameter for theMaxwell term. The complete analysis of stability is carried out for all theseextremal black holes. It is found that they are all unstable. To understandthis instability, we study the non-extremal charged black hole with two (innerand outer) horizons. The extremal black holes appear when two horizonscoalesce. It conjectures that the instability originates from the innerhorizon.
