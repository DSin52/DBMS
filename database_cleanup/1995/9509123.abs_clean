A pair of conformal sigma models related by Poisson-Lie T-duality isconstructed by starting with the O(2,2) Drinfeld double. The duality relatesthe standard SL(2,R) WZNW model to a constrained sigma model defined on SL(2,R)group space. The quantum equivalence of the models is established by using apath integral argument.
