We study the formation of vacuum condensates in $2+1$ dimensional QED in thepresence of inhomogeneous background magnetic fields. For a large class ofmagnetic fields, the condensate is shown to be proportional to theinhomogeneous magnetic field, in the large flux limit. This may be viewed as a{\it local} form of the {\it integrated} degeneracy-flux relation of Aharonovand Casher.
