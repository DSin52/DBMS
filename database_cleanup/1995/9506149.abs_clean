Title: Pauli-Villars Regularization of Supergravity and Field Theory Anomalies

Comments: 8 pages, Talk given at SUSY95, l'Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau,

France, May 15-19, 1995A procedure for Pauli-Villars regularization of locally and globallysupersymmetric theories is described. Implications for specific theories,especially those obtained from superstrings, are discussed with emphasis on therole of field theory anomalies.
