The ten dimensional heterotic string effective action with graviton, dilatonand antisymmetric tensor fields is dimensionally reduced to two spacetimedimensions. The resulting theory, with some constraints on backgrounds, admitsinfinite sequence of conserved nonlocal currents. It is shown that generatorsof the infinitesimal transformations associated with these currents satisfyKac-Moody algebra.
