Title: A discussion on a possibility to interpret quantum mechanics in terms of

general relativityComments: Latex 6 pages

It is shown that, with some reasonable assumptions, the theory of generalrelativity can be made compatible with quantum mechanics by using the fieldequations of general relativity to construct a Robertson-Walker metric for aquantum particle so that the line element of the particle can be transformedentirely to that of the Minkowski spacetime, which is assumed by a quantumobserver, and the spacetime dynamics of the particle described by a Minkowskiobserver takes the form of quantum mechanics. Spacetime structure of a quantumparticle may have either positive or negative curvature. However, in order tobe describable using the familiar framework of quantum mechanics, the spacetimestructure of a quantum particle must be "quantised" by an introduction of theimaginary number $i$. If a particle has a positive curvature then thequantisation is equivalent to turning the pseudo-Riemannian spacetime of theparticle into a Riemannian spacetime. This means that it is assumed theparticle is capable of measuring its temporal distance like its spatialdistances. On the other hand, when a particle has a negative curvature and anegative energy density then quantising the spacetime structure of the particleis equivalent to viewing the particle as if it had a positive curvature and apositive energy density.
