Title: A geometric formulation of strong interaction

Comments: Latex, 5 pages

It is observed that, at short range, the field equations of generalrelativity admit a line element that takes the form of Yukawa potential. Theresult leads to the possibility that strong interaction may also be describedby field equations that have the same form as that of general relativity. It isthen shown how such field equations may arise from the coupling of two strongfields.
