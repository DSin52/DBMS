The Sp(2)-symmetric Lagrangian quantization scheme is represented in acompletely anticanonical form. Antifields are assigned to all field variablesincluding former "parametric" ones \pi^{Aa}. The antibrackets (F, G)^a as wellas the operators \triangle^a and V^a are extended to include the newanticanonical pairs \pi^{Aa}, \bar{\phi}_A. A new version of the gauge fixingmechanism in the Lagrangian effective action is proposed. The correspondingfunctional integral is shown to be gauge independent.
