an Heterotic String SolitonAuthors: Murat Gunaydin and Hermann Nicolai

Comments: 7 pages, Latex document. This is the final version that appeared in

Phys. Lett. B that includes an extra paragraph about the physical propertiesof the octonionic two-brane. We have also put an addendum regarding somerelated references that were brought to our attention recentlyJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B351 (1995) 169-172; Addendum-ibid. B376 (1996) 329

We construct an octonionic instanton solution to the seven dimensionalYang-Mills theory based on the exceptional gauge group $G_2$ which is theautomorphism group of the division algebra of octonions. This octonionicinstanton has an extension to a solitonic two-brane solution of the low energyeffective theory of the heterotic string that preserves two of the sixteensupersymmetries and hence corresponds to $N=1$ space-time supersymmetry in the(2+1) dimensions transverse to the seven dimensions where the Yang-Millsinstanton is defined.
