The fusion procedure is implemented for the dilute $A_L$ lattice models and afusion hierarchy of functional equations with an $su(3)$ structure is derivedfor the fused transfer matrices. We also present the Bethe ansatz equations forthe dilute $A_L$ lattice models and discuss their connection with the fusionhierarchy. The solution of the fusion hierarchy for the eigenvalue spectra ofthe dilute $A_L$ lattice models will be presented in a subsequent paper.
