We show that the non-critical $c=1$ string at the self-dual radius isequivalent to topological strings based on the deformation of the conifoldsingularity of Calabi-Yau threefolds. The Penner sum giving the genus expansionof the free energy of the $c=1$ string theory at the self-dual radius thereforegives the universal behaviour of the topological partition function of aCalabi-Yau threefold near a conifold point.
