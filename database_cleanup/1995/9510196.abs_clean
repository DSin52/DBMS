Applying the principle of analytic extension for generalized functions wederive causal propagators for algebraic non-covariant gauges. The so generatedmanifestly causal gluon propagator in the light-cone gauge is used to evaluatetwo one-loop Feynman integrals which appear in the computation of thethree-gluon vertex correction. The result is in agreement with that obtainedthrough the usual prescriptions.
