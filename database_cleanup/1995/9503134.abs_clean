Journal-ref: Phys. Lett. B352 (1995) 75

Using the string field theory recently proposed by the authors andcollaborators, we give a background independent formulation of rationalnoncritical string theories with $c\leq 1$. With a little modification of thestring field Hamiltonians previously constructed, we obtain string fieldtheories which include various rational noncritical string theories asclassical backgrounds.
