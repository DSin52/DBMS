We construct more dual pairs of type II-heterotic strings in four dimensionswith $N=2,1$ spacetime supersymmetry. On the type II side the constructionutilizes the various possible choices of K3 automorphisms with fixed pointswhich transform the holomorphic two-form nontrivially, and rotation plustranslation on $T^2$. The Calabi-Yau orbifolds so obtained have non-zero Eulernumbers, so quantum corrections exist on the type IIA strings. The heteroticstring (asymmetric) orbifold duals are found which depend on going to theenhanced symmetry points. Some aspects of the construction are discussedincluding the role of the singularity and the possibility of going beyond theadiabatic argument. Many of these examples have also orientifold analogs.
