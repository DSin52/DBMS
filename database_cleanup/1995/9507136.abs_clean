We discuss the behavior of theories of fermions coupled to Chern-Simons gaugefields with a non-abelian gauge group in three dimensions and at finitetemperature. Using non-perturbative arguments and gauge invariance, and incontradiction with perturbative results, we show that the coefficient of theChern-Simons term of the effective actions for the gauge fields at finitetemperature can be {\it at most} an integer function of the temperature. Thisis in a sense a generalized no-renormalization theorem. We also discuss thecase of abelian theories and give indications that a similar condition shouldhold there too. We discuss consequences of our results to the thermodynamics ofanyon superfluids and fractional quantum Hall systems.
