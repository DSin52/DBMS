A general formula for the canonical partition function for a system obeyingany statistics based on the permutation group is derived. The formula expressesthe canonical partition function in terms of sums of Schur functions. The onlyhitherto known result due to Suranyi [ Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 65}, 2329 (1990)]for parasystems of order two is shown to arise as a special case of our generalformula. Our results also yield all the relevant information about thestructure of the Fock spaces for parasystems.
