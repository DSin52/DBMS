Title: Reduction of Coupling Parameters

Comments: Plenary talk presented at the XVIIIth International Workshop on High

Energy Physics and Field Theory, Moscow-Protvino, June 1995. To be publishedin the Proceedings. 20 pages, LatexThe general theory of the reduction in the number of coupling parameters isdiscussed. The method involves renormalization group invariant relationsbetween couplings. It is more general than the imposition of symmetries. Thereare reduced theories with no known symmetry. The reduction scheme is findingmany applications. Discussed in some detail are the construction of gaugetheories with ``minimal'' coupling for Yang-Mills and matter fields, and theGauge-Yukawa Unification within N=1 supersymmetric GUT's.
