Authors: J.Gegelia, N.Kiknadze

Comments: 3 pages (LaTEX file)

Some considerations showing that renormalizable theories with consistentperturbative theries can not be nonperturbatively finite (in terms of bareparameters) are provided. Accordingly any fundamental unified theory has to beeither non renormalizable or order by order finite.
