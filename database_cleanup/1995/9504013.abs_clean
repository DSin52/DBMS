The large N limit of the hermitian matrix model in three and four Euclideanspace-time dimensions is studied with the help of the approximateRenormalization Group recursion formula. The planar graphs contributing to wavefunction, mass and coupling constant renormalization are identified and summedin this approximation. In four dimensions the model fails to have aninteracting continuum limit, but in three dimensions there is a non trivialfixed point for the approximate RG relations. The critical exponents of thethree dimensional model at this fixed point are $\nu = 0.665069$ and$\eta=0.19882$. The existence (or non existence) of the fixed point and thecritical exponents display a fairly high degree of universality since they donot seem to depend on the specific (non universal) assumptions made in theapproximation.
