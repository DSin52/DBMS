Title: Introduction to the Theory of Goyaks (Operator Manifold Approach to

Geometry and Particle Physics)Comments: 86 pages, LaTex, the revised version of ICTP Preprint (Sep.,1994)

submitted to Annals of PhysicsThe question that guides our discussion is "how did the geometry andparticles come into being?" To explore this query we suggest the theory ofgoyaks, which reveals the primordial deeper structures underlying fundamantalconcepts of contemporary physics. It address itself to the question of theprime-cause of origin of geometry and basic concepts of particle physics suchas the fundamental fields of quarks and leptons with the spins and variousquantum numbers, internal symmetries and so on; also basic principles ofRelativity, Quantum, Gauge and Color Confinement, which are, as it was proven,all derivative and come into being simultaneously. The substance out of whichthe geometry and particles are made is a set of new physical structures-thegoyaks involved into reciprocal linkage establishing processes. We elaborated anew mathematical framework, which is a still wider generalization of thefamiliar methods of secondary quantization with appropriate expansion over thegeometric objects. One interesting offshoot of it directly leads to theformalism of operator manifold, which framed our discussion throughout thispaper. It yields the quantization of geometry, which differs in principle fromall earlier studies. Many of the important anticipated properties, basicconcepts and principles of particle physics are appeared quite naturally in theframework of suggested theory. It predicts a class of possible models ofinternal symmetries, which utilize the whole idea of gauge symmetry andreproduce the known phenomenology of electromagnetic, weak and stronginteractions. Here we focused our attention mainly on developing themathematical foundations for our novel viewpoint. We believe that the morerealistic final theory of particles and interactions can be found within the
