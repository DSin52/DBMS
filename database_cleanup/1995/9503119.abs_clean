< \psibarpsi > vanishing above $T_c$ indicates chiral symmetry restoration athigh $T$. But is it the old $T=0$ chiral symmetry that is `restored'? In thistalk, I report on the spacetime quantization of the BPFTW effective action forquarks in a hot environ. The fermion propagator is known to give apseudo-Lorentz invariant particle pole as well as new spacelike cuts. Ourquantization shows that the spacelike cuts directly lead to a thermal vacuumthat is a generalized NJL state, with a curious $90^{o}$ phase. This $90^{o}$is responsible for < \psibarpsi > vanishing at high $T$. The thermal vacuum isinvariant under a new chiral charge, but continues to break the old zerotemperature chirality. Our quantization suggests a new class of orderparameters that probe the physics of these spacelike cuts. In usual scenario,the pion dissociates in the early alphabet soup. With this new understanding ofthe thermal vacuum, the pion remains a Nambu-Goldstone particle at high $T$,and will not dissociate. It propagates at the speed of light but with a halo.
