Title: Introduction to Black Hole Microscopy

Comments: Latex file, 26 pages; 12 figures included using psfig

The aim of these notes is both to review the standard understanding of theHawking effect, and to discuss the modifications to this understanding thatmight be required by new physics at short distances. The fundamentals of theUnruh effect are reviewed, and then the Hawking effect is explained as a``gravitational Unruh effect", with particular attention to thestate-dependence of this picture. The order of magnitude of deviations from thethermal spectrum of Hawking radiation is estimated under various hypotheses onphysics at short distances. The behavior of black hole radiation in a linearmodel with altered short distance physics---the Unruh model---is discussed indetail.
