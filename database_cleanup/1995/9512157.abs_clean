We study some features of dyonic Black hole solution in heterotic stringtheory on a six torus. This solution has 58 parameters. Of these, 28 parametersdenote the electric charge of the black hole, another 28 correspond to themagnetic charge, and the other two parameters being the mass and the angularmomentum of the black hole. We discuss the extremal limit and show that invarious limits, it reduces to the known black hole solutions. The solutionssaturating the Bogomolnyi bound are identified. Explicit solution is presentedfor the non-rotating dyonic black hole.
