The stability of a new class of hairy black hole solutions in the coupledsystem of Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs is examined, generalising a methodsuggested by Brodbeck and Straumann and collaborators, and Volkov and Gal'tsov.The method maps the algebraic system of linearised radial perturbations of thevarious field modes around the black hole solution into a coupled system ofradial equations of Schr\"odinger type. No detailed knowledge of the black holesolution is required, except from the fact that the boundary conditions at thephysical space-time boundaries (horizons) must be such so as to guarantee the{\it finiteness} of the various expressions involved. In this way, it isdemonstrated that the above Schr\"odinger equations have bound states, whichimplies the instability of the associated black hole solution.
