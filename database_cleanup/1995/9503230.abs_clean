Motivated by the discovery of errors in six of the 135 diagrams in thepublished five-loop expansions of the $\beta$-function and the anomalousdimensions of the ${O}(n)$-symmetric $\phi^4$-theory in $D=4-\ep$ dimensions wepresent the results of a full analytic reevaluation of all diagrams. Thedivergences are removed by minimal subtraction and $\ep$-expansions are givenfor the critical exponents $\eta$, $\nu$, and $\omega$ up to order$\epsilon^5$.
