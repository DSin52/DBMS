Title: Superconvergence, Confinement and Duality

Comments: Talk presented at the International Workshop on High Energy Physics,

Novy Svit, Crimea, September 1995. To be published in the Proceedings. 15pages, LatexArguments for the confinement of transverse gauge field excitations, whichare based upon superconvergence relations of the propagator, and upon the BRSTalgebra, are reviewed and applied to supersymmetric models. They are shown tobe in agreement with recent results obtained as a consequence of holomorphy andduality in certain $N=1$ SUSY models. The significance of the one loopanomalous dimension of the gauge field in the Landau gauge is emphasized. Forthe models considered, it is shown to be proportional, with negative relativesign, to the one loop coefficient of the renormalization group function for the{\it dual map} of the original theory.
