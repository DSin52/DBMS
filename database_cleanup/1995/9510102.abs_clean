Title: BRST Symmetric Gaugeon Formalism for Yang-Mills Fields

Authors: M. Koseki, M. Sato and R. Endo

Comments: 14 pages, LaTeX

Yokoyama's gaugeon formalism is knwon to admit $q$-number gaugetransformation. We introduce BRST symmetries into the formalism for theYang-Mills gauge field. Owing to the BRST symmetry, Yokoyama's physicalsubsidiary conditions are replaced by a single condition of the Kugo-Ojimatype. Our physical subsidiary condition is invariant under the $q$-number gaugetransformation. Thus, our physical subspace is gauge invariant.
