We consider a simple static extremal multi-black hole solution withconstituents charged under different $U(1)$ fields. Each of the constituents byitself is an extremal dilatonic black hole of coupling $a=\srt$. For a specialcase with two electrically and two magnetically charged black holes themulti-black hole solution interpolates between the familiar$a=\sqrt{3},1,\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ and $0$ solutions, depending on how manyblack holes are placed at infinity. This proves the hypothesis that black holeswith the above dilaton couplings arise in string theory as bound states offundamental $a=\sqrt{3}$ states with zero binding energy. We also generalizethe result to states where the action does not admit a single scalar truncationand show that a wide class of dyonic black holes in toroidally compactifiedstring theory can be viewed as bound states of fundamental $a=\srt$ blackholes.
