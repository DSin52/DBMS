The elementary and solitonic supersymmetric $p$-brane solutions tosupergravity theories form families related by dimensional reduction, eachheaded by a maximal (`stainless') member that cannot be isotropicallydimensionally oxidized into higher dimensions. We find several new families,headed by stainless solutions in various dimensions $D\le 9$. In some cases,these occur with dimensions $(D,p)$ that coincide with those of descendants ofknown families, but since the new solutions are stainless, they are necessarilydistinct. The new stainless supersymmetric solutions include a 6-brane and a5-brane in $D=9$, a string in $D=5$, and particles in all dimensions $5\le D\le9$.
