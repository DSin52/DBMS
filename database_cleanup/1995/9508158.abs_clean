Title: The Problem of Constructing the Current Operators in Quantum Field

TheoryComments: 7 pages, LaTeX

Lorentz invariance of the current operators implies that they satisfy thewell-known commutation relations with the representation operators of theLorentz group. It is shown that if the standard construction of the currentoperators in quantum field theory is used then the commutation relations arebroken by the Schwinger terms.
