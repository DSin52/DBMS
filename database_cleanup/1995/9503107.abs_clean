The structure of block-spin embeddings of the U(1) lattice current algebra isdescribed. For an odd number of lattice sites, the inner realizations of theshift automorphism areclassified. We present a particular inner shift operatorwhich admits a factorization involving quantum dilogarithms analogous to theresults of Faddeev and Volkov.
