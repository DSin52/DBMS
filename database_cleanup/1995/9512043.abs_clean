In these lectures I review the general structure of electric--magneticduality rotations in every even space--time dimension. In four dimensions,which is my main concern, I discuss the general issue of symplectic covarianceand how it relates to the typical geometric structures involved by N=2supersymmetry, namely Special K\"ahler geometry for the vector multiplets andeither HyperK\"ahler or Quaternionic geometry for the hypermultiplets. Idiscuss classical continuous dualities versus non--perturbative discretedualities. How the moduli space geometry of an auxiliary dynamical Riemannsurface (or Calabi--Yau threefold) relates to exact space--time dualities isexemplified in detail for the Seiberg Witten model of an $SU(2)$ gauge theory.
