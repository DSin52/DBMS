We study the one loop renormalization in the most general metric-dilaton theorywith the second derivative terms only. The general theory can be divided intotwo classes, models of one are equivalent to conformally coupled with gravityscalar field and also to general relativity with cosmological term. The modelsof second class have one extra degree of freedom which corresponds to dilaton.We calculate the one loop divergences for the models of second class and findthat the arbitrary functions of dilaton in the starting action can befine-tuned in such a manner that all the higher derivative countertermsdisappear on shell. The only structures in both classical action andcounterterms, which survive on shell, are the potential (cosmological) ones.They can be removed by renormalization of the dilaton field which acquire thenontrivial anomalous dimension, that leads to the effective running of thecosmological constant. For some of the renormalizable solutions of the theorythe observable low energy value of the cosmological constant is small ascompared with the Newtonian constant. We also discuss another application ofour result.
