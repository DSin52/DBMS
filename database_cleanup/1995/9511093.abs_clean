Title: On the origin of three generation free fermionic superstring models

Comments: 12 pages, phyzzx.tex, tables.tex

The three generation superstring models in the free fermionic models have hadremarkable success in describing the real--world. The most explored models usethe NAHE set to obtain three generations and to separate the hidden andobservable sectors. It is of course well known that the full NAHE set is notrequired in order to construct three generation free fermionic models. I arguethat all the semi--realistic free fermionic models that have been constructedto date correspond to $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifolds. Thus, the successes of thesemi--realistic free fermionic models, if taken seriously, suggest that thetrue string vacuum is a $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifold with nontrivial backgroundfields and quantized Wilson lines.
