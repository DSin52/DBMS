Title: Infinite series solutions of the symmetry equation for the $1 +2$

dimensional continuous Toda chainAuthors: D.B. Fairlie and A.N. Leznov

Comments: 9 pages, latex, no figures

A sequence of solutions to the equation of symmetry for the continuous Todachain in $1+2$ dimensions is represented in explicit form. This fact leads tothe supposition that this equation is completely integrable.
