Title: Symmetry in the Topological Phase of String Theory

Comments: 37 pages, TeX (an important errata has been added)

I present arguments to the affect that the topological phase of string theorymust be event-symmetric. This motivates a search for a universal string groupfor discrete strings in event-symmetric space-time which unifies space-timesymmetry with internal gauge symmetry. This is partially successful but theresults are incomplete and I speculate on the use of quantum groups to define awell behaved theory which would resolve the discrete/continuum dual nature ofstringy space-time.
