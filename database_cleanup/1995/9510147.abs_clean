Area preserving diffeomorphisms of a 2-d compact Riemannian manifold with orwithout boundary are studied. We find two classes of decompositions of aRiemannian metric, namely, h- and g-decomposition, that help to formulate agravitational theory which is area preserving diffeomorphism (SDiff$M$-)invariant but not necessarily diffeomorphism invariant. The general covarianceof equations of motion of such a theory can be achieved by incorporating properWeyl rescaling. The h-decomposition makes the conformal factor of a metricSDiff$M$-invariant and the rest of the metric invariant under conformaldiffeomorphisms, whilst the g-decomposition makes the conformal factor aSDiff$M$ scalar and the rest a SDiff$M$ tensor. Using these, we reformulateLiouville gravity in SDiff$M$ invariant way. In this context we also furtherclarify the dual formulation of Liouville gravity introduced by the authorbefore, in which the affine spin connection is dual to the Liouville field.
