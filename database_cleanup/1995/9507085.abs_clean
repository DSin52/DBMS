Following on from recent work describing the representation content of ameromorphic bosonic conformal field theory in terms of a certain state insidethe theory corresponding to a fixed state in the representation, and using workof Zhu on a correspondence between the representations of the conformal fieldtheory and representations of a particular associative algebra constructed fromit, we construct a general solution for the state defining the representationand identify the further restrictions on it necessary for it to correspond to aground state in the representation space. We then use this general theory toanalyze the representations of the Heisenberg algebra and its $Z_2$-projection.The conjectured uniqueness of the twisted representation is shown explicitly,and we extend our considerations to the reflection-twisted FKS construction ofa conformal field theory from a lattice.
