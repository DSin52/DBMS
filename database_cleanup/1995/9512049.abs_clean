The charge screening, confinement of fermion quantum numbers and the chiralcondensate formation in two-dimensional QED is studied in details. It is shownthat charge screening and confinement of fermion number in two-dimensional QEDis due to an appearance of gauge fields which nullify the Dirac determinant. Anappearance of the fields of another type but with the same property yield thechiral condensate formation. In addition, these second type fields ensure the"softness" of the charge screening in a process which is analogous to the$e^+e^-$ annihilation.
