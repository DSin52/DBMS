Equations of associativity in two-dimensional topological field theory (theyare known also as the Witten-Dijkgraaf-H.Verlinde-E.Verlinde (WDVV) system) arerepresented as an example of the general theory of integrable Hamiltoniannondiagonalizable (i.e., do not possessing Riemann invariants) systems ofhydrodynamic type. A corresponding local nondegenerate Hamiltonian structure ofhydrodynamic type (Poisson bracket of Dubrovin-Novikov type) is found. For n=3the equations of associativity are reduced to the integrable three wave systemby a chain of explicit transformations. Any solution of the integrable threewave system generates solutions of the equations of associativity. ExplicitB\"acklund type transformations connecting solutions of different equations ofassociativity are found.
