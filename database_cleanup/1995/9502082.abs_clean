We construct the BRST cohomology under a positive definite inner product andobtain the Hodge decomposition theorem at a non-degenerate state vector space$V$. The harmonic states isomorphic with a BRST cohomology class correspond tothe physical Hilbert space with positive norm as long as the completeness of$Q_{BRST}$ is satisfied. We explicitly define ``co-BRST'' operator and analyzethe quartet mechanism in QED.
