Title: QED_2 and U(1)-Problem

QED_2 with mass and N flavors of fermions is constructed using Euclidean pathintegrals. The fermion masses are treated perturbatively and the convergence ofthe mass perturbation series is proven for a finite space-time cutoff. Theexpectation functional is decomposed into clustering theta-vacua and theirproperties are compared to the theta-vacua of QCD for zero fermion mass. Thesector that is created by the N^2 classically conserved vector currents isidentified. The currents that correspond to a Cartan subalgebra of U(N) arebosonized together with the chiral densities in terms of a generalizedSine-Gordon model. The solution of the U(1)-problem of QED_2 is discussed and aWitten-Veneziano formula is shown to hold for the mass spectrum of thepseudoscalars. Evaluation of the Fredenhagen-Marcu confinement order parameterclarifies the structure of superselection sectors.
