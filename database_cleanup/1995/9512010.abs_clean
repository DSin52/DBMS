Title: Current Operators in Quantum Field Theory and Sum Rules in Deep

Inelastic ScatteringComments: 18 pages, LaTeX

It is shown that in the general case the canonical construction of thecurrent operators in quantum field theory does not render a bona fide vectorfield since Lorentz invariance is violated by Schwinger terms. We argue thatthe nonexistence of the canonical current operators for spinor fields followsfrom a very simple algebraic consideration. As a result, the well-known sumrules in deep inelastic scattering are not substantiated.
