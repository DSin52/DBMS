We show that a (2+1)-dimensional $P,T-$invariant free fermion system,relevant to $P,T-$conserving models of high-$T_c$ superconductivity, has aU(1,1) dynamical symmetry as well as an $N=3$ supersymmetry with the evengenerator being a quadratic function of the spin operator and of the generatorof chiral ${\rm U_c(1)}$ transformations. We demonstrate that the hiddensupersymmetry leads to a non-standard superextension of the (2+1)-dimensionalPoincar\'e group. As a result, the one particle states of the $P,T-$invariantfermion system realize an irreducible representation of the Poincar\'esupergroup labelled by the zero eigenvalue of the superspin operator.
