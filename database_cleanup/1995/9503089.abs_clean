Three dimensional black holes in a generalized dilaton gravity action theoryare analysed. The theory is specified by two fields, the dilaton and thegraviton, and two parameters, the cosmological constant and the Brans-Dickeparameter. It contains seven different cases, of which one distinguishes asspecial cases, string theory, general relativity and a theory equivalent tofour dimensional general relativity with one Killing vector. We study thecausal structure and geodesic motion of null and timelike particles in theblack hole geometries and find the ADM masses of the different solutions.
