Starting from the dual action of $(4,4)$ $2D$ twisted multiplets in theharmonic superspace with two independent sets of $SU(2)$ harmonic variables, wepresent its generalization which hopefully provides an off-shell description ofgeneral $(4,4)$ supersymmetric sigma models with torsion. Like the action ofthe torsionless $(4,4)$ hyper-K\"ahler sigma models in the standard harmonicsuperspace, it is characterized by a number of superfield potentials. Theydepend on $n$ copies of a triple of analytic harmonic $(4,4)$ superfields. Asdistinct from the hyper-K\"ahler case, the potentials prove to be severelyconstrained by the self-consistency condition which stems from thecommutativity of the left and right harmonic derivatives. We show that for$n=1$ these constraints reduce the general action to that of $(4,4)$ twistedmultiplet, while for $n\geq 2$ there exists a wide class of new actions whichcannot be written only via twisted multiplets. Their most striking feature isthe nonabelian and in general nonlinear gauge invariance which substitutes theabelian gauge symmetry of the dual action of twisted multiplets and ensures thecorrect number of physical degrees of freedom. We show, on a simple example,that these actions describe sigma models with non-commuting left and rightcomplex structures on the bosonic target.
