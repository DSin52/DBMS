New features of a previously introduced Group Approach to Quantization arepresented. We show that the construction of the symmetry group associated withthe system to be quantized (the ``quantizing group") does not require, ingeneral, the explicit construction of the phase space of the system, i.e., doesnot require the actual knowledgement of the general solution of the classicalgroup can be given, directly, on configuration space. As an application weconstruct the symmetry group for the conformally invariant massless scalar andelectromagnetic fields and the scalar and Dirac fields evolving in a symmetriccurved space- time or interacting with symmetric classicalelectromagnetic fields. Further generalizations of the present procedure arealso discussed and in particular the conditions under which non-abelian (mainlyKac-Moody) groups can be included.
