We recast the quaternionic Gursey-Tze solution, which is a fourfoldquasi-periodic self-dual Yang-Mills field with a unit instanton number perEuclidean spacetime cell, into an ordinary coordinate formulation. Afterperforming the sum in the Euclidean time direction, we use an observation byRossi which suggests the solution represents an arrangement with a BPS monopoleper space lattice cell. This may provide a concrete realization of a monopolecondensate in pure Yang-Mills theory.
