The $(g_2^{(1)}, d_4^{(3)})$\ pair of non simply laced affine Toda theoriesis studied from the point of view of non perturbative duality. The classicalspectrum of each member is composed of two massive scalar particles. The exactS-matrix prediction for the dual behaviour of the coupling dependent mass ratiois found to be in strong agreement with Monte Carlo data.
