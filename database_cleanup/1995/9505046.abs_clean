We discuss the unification of gauge couplings within the framework of a wideclass of realistic free-fermionic string models which have appeared in theliterature, including the flipped SU(5), SO(6)xSO(4), and variousSU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) models. If the matter spectrum below the string scale is thatof the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), then string unification isin disagreement with experiment. We therefore examine several effects that maymodify the minimal string predictions. First, we develop a systematic procedurefor evaluating the one-loop heavy string threshold corrections infree-fermionic string models, and we explicitly evaluate these corrections foreach of the realistic models. We find that these string threshold correctionsare small, and we provide general arguments explaining why such thresholdcorrections are suppressed in string theory. Thus heavy thresholds cannotresolve the disagreement with experiment. We also study the effect ofnon-standard hypercharge normalizations, light SUSY thresholds, andintermediate-scale gauge structure, and similarly conclude that these effectscannot resolve the disagreement with low-energy data. Finally, we examine theeffects of additional color triplets and electroweak doublets beyond the MSSM.Although not required in ordinary grand unification scenarios, such statesgenerically appear within the context of certain realistic free-fermionicstring models. We show that if these states exist at the appropriatethresholds, then the gauge couplings will indeed unify at the string scale.Thus, within these string models, string unification can be in agreement withlow-energy data.
