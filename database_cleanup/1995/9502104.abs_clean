The massive scalar field theory and the chiral Schwinger model are quantized ona Poincar\'e disk of radius $\rho$. The amplitudes are derived in terms ofhypergeometric functions. The behavior at long distances and near the boundaryof some of the relevant correlation functions is studied. The exact computationof the chiral determinant appearing in the Schwinger model is obtainedexploiting perturbation theory. This calculation poses interesting mathematicalproblems, as the Poincar\'e disk is a noncompact manifold with a metric tensorwhich diverges approaching the boundary. The results presented in this paperare very useful in view of possible extensions to general Riemann surfaces.Moreover, they could also shed some light in the quantization of field theorieson manifolds with constant curvature scalars in higher dimensions.
