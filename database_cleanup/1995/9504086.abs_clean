We show that the formation of condensates in the presence of a constantmagnetic field in 2+1 dimensions is extremely unstable. It disappears as soonas a heat bath is introduced with or without a chemical potential. We point outsome new nonanalytic behavior that develops in this system at finitetemperature.
