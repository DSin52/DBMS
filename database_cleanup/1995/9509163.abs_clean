Title: Non-Commutative Geometry and the Strong Force

Comments: 7 pages, LATEX (minor grammatical changes)

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B366 (1996) 220-223

The restrictions imposed on the strong force in the `non-commutative standardmodel' are examined. It is concluded that given the framework ofnon-commutative geometry and assuming the electroweak sector of the standardmodel many details of the strong force can be explained including its vectorialnature.
