The main result of this paper is the construction of a conformally covariantoperator in two dimensions acting on scalar fields and containing fourth orderderivatives. In this way it is possible to derive a class of Lagrangiansinvariant under conformal transformations. They define conformal field theoriessatisfying equations of the biharmonic type. Two kinds of these biharmonicfield theories are distinguished, characterized by the possibility or not ofthe scalar fields to transform non-trivially under Weyl transformations. Bothcases are relevant for string theory and two dimensional gravity. Thebiharmonic conformal field theories provide higher order corrections to theequations of motion of the metric and give a possibility of adding new terms tothe Polyakov action.
