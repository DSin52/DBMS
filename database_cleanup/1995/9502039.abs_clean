Title: Diagonal $K$-matrices and transfer matrix eigenspectra associated with

the $G^{(1)}_2$ $R$-matrixAuthors: C. M. Yung and M. T. Batchelor

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX

We find all the diagonal $K$-matrices for the $R$-matrix associated with theminimal representation of the exceptional affine algebra $G^{(1)}_2$. Thecorresponding transfer matrices are diagonalized with a variation of theanalytic Bethe ansatz. We find many similarities with the case of theIzergin-Korepin $R$-matrix associated with the affine algebra $A^{(2)}_2$.
