We analyze the U-duality group for the case of a type II superstringcompactified to four dimensions on a K3 surface times a torus. The variouslimits of this theory are considered which have interpretations as type IIA andIIB superstrings, the heterotic string, and eleven-dimensional supergravity,allowing all these theories to be directly related to each other. The integralstructure which appears in the Ramond-Ramond sector of the type II superstringis related to the quantum cohomology of general Calabi-Yau threefolds whichallows the moduli space of type II superstring compactifications on Calabi-Yaumanifolds to be analyzed.
