We show how a general nonstandard Lax equation (supersymmetric or otherwise)can be expressed as a standard Lax equation. This enables us to define theGelfand-Dikii brackets for a nonstandard supersymmetric equation. We discussthe Hamiltonian structures for the nonstandard super KP system and work outexplicitly the two Hamiltonian structures of the supersymmetric Two Bosonsystem from this point of view.
