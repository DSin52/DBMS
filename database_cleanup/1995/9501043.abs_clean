We study relativistic self-dual Chern-Simons-Higgs systems in the presence ofuniform background fields that explicitly break CTP. A rich, but discretevacuum structure is found when the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken,while the symmetric phase can have an infinite vacuum degeneracy at tree level.The latter is due to the proliferation of neutral solitonic states that costzero energy. Various novel self-dual solitons, such as these, are found in boththe symmetric and the asymmetric phases. Also by considering a similar systemon a two-sphere and the subsequent large sphere limit, we isolate sensible andfinite expressions for the conserved angular and linear momenta, which satisfyanomalous commutation relations. We conclude with a few remarks on unresolvedissues.
