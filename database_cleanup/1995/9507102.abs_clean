Caxambu, Brazil, October 24-28, 1995, pages 422--425 (Sociedade Brasileira deFisica, 1996)We study the connection between N=2 supersymmetry and a topological bound ina two-Higgs-doublet system having an $SU(2)\times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_{Y'}$gauge group. We derive Bogomol'nyi equations from supersymmetry considerationsshowing that they hold provided certain conditions on the coupling constants,which are a consequence of the huge symmetry of the theory, are satisfied.
