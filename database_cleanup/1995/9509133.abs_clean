A functional integral approach is developed to discuss the bosonisation ofthe massive Thirring and the massive Schwinger models in arbitraryD-dimensions. It is found that these models, to {\it all} orders in the inversefermi mass, bosonise to a theory involving a usual gauge field and a (D-2) rankantisymmetric (Kalb-Ramond) tensor field. Explicit bosonisation identities forthe fermion current are deduced. Specialising to the lowest order reveals (forany $D \geq 4$) a mapping between the massive Thirring model and the Procamodel. It also establishes an exact duality between the Proca model and themassive (D-2) rank Kalb-Ramond model. Schwinger terms in the current algebraare computed. Conventional bosonisation results in D=2, 3 are reproduced.
