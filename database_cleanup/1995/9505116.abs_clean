The gravitini zero modes riding on top of the extreme Reissner-Nordstromblack-hole solution of N=2 supergravity are shown to be normalizable. Thegravitini and dilatini zero modes of axion-dilaton extreme black-hole solutionsof N=4 supergravity are also given and found to have finite norms. These normsare duality invariant. The finiteness and positivity of the norms in both casesare found to be correlated with the Witten-Israel-Nester construction; however,we have replaced the Witten condition by the pure-spin-3/2 constraint on thegravitini. We compare our calculation of the norms with the calculations whichprovide the moduli space metric for extreme black holes.The action of the N=2 hypermultiplet with an off-shell central chargedescribes the solitons of N=2 supergravity. This action, in theMajumdar-Papapetrou multi-black-hole background, is shown to be N=2 rigidlysupersymmetric.
