The Lee-Weinberg $U(1)$ magnetic monopoles, which have been reinterpreted astopological solitons of a certain non-Abelian gauged Higgs model recently, areconsidered for some specific choice of Higgs couplings. The model underconsideration is shown to admit a Bogomol'nyi-type bound which is saturated bythe configurations satisfying the generalized BPS equations. We consider thespherically symmetric monopole solutions in some detail.
