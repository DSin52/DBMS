We propose actions for non-linear sigma models on cosets $G/H$ in 2+1dimensions that include the most general non-linear realizations ofChern-Simons terms. When $G$ is simply connected and $H$ contains $r$ commutingU(1) factors, there are $r$ different topologically conserved charges andgenerically $r$ different types of topological solitons. Soliton spinfractionalizes as a function of the Chern-Simons couplings, with independentspins associated to each species of soliton charge, as well as to pairs ofdifferent charges. This model of soliton spin fractionalization generalizes toarbitrary $G/H$ a model of Wilczek and Zee for one type of soliton.
