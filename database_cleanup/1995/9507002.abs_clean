In the following paper we continue the work of Bimonte-Lizzi-Sparano ondistances on a one dimensional lattice. We succeed in proving analytically theexact formulae for such distances. We find that the distance to an even pointon the lattice is the geometrical average of the ``predecessor'' and``successor'' distances to the neighbouring odd points.
