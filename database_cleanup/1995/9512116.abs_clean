corrections and additional discussion, comparison of results with recent workon the SU(3) case with maximal symmetry breakingA semi-classical check of the Goddard-Nuyts-Olive (GNO) generalized dualityconjecture for gauge theories with adjoint Higgs fields is performed for thecase where the unbroken gauge group is non-abelian. The monopole solutions ofthe theory transform under the non-abelian part of the unbroken global symmetryand the associated component of the moduli space is a Lie group coset space.The well-known problems in introducing collective coordinates for thesedegrees-of-freedom are solved by considering suitable multi-monopoleconfigurations in which the long-range non-abelian fields cancel. In thecontext of an $N=4$ supersymmetric gauge theory, the multiplicity of BPSsaturated states is given by the number of ground-states of a supersymmetricquantum mechanics on the compact internal moduli space. The resultingdegeneracy is expressed as the Euler character of the coset space. In all casesthe number of states is consistent with the dimensions of the multiplets of theunbroken dual gauge group, and hence the results provide strong support for theGNO conjecture.
