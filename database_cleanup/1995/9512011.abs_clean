In this paper, the relationship between the sine-Gordon model with anintegrable boundary condition and the Thirring model with boundary is discussedand the reflection $R$-matrix for the massive Thirring model, which is relatedto the physical boundary parameters of the sine-Gordon model, is given. Therelationship between the the boundary parameters and the two formal parametersappearing in the work of Ghoshal and Zamolodchikov is discussed.
