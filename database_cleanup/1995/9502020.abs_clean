Title: Is There Physics in Landau Poles ?

Comments: 17 pages, plain TeX, no figures

Triviality and Landau poles are often greeted as harbingers of new physics at1 TeV. After briefly reviewing the ideas behind this, a model of singularquantum mechanics is introduced. Its ultraviolet structure, as well as somefeatures of its vacuum, related to triviality, very much parallel$\lambda\phi^4$. The model is solvable, exactly and perturbatively, in anydimension. From its analysis we learn that Landau poles do not appear in anyexactly computed observable, but only in truncated perturbation theory, whenperturbation theory is performed with the wrong sign coupling. If thesefindings apply to the standard model no new physics at 1 TeV should be expectedbut only challenges for theorists.
