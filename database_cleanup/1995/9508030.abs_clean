The topological field theories associated with affine Lie superalgebras areconstructed. Their BRST symmetry is characterised by a Kazama algebracontaining spin 1, 2 and 3 operators and closes linearly. Under this symmetryall operators are grouped into BRST doublets. The relation between the modelsconstructed and non-critical string theories is explored.
