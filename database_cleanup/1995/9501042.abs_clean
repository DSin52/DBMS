Title: Approximate solutions of exact renormalization group equations

Authors: D. Litim and N. Tetradis

Comments: 14 pages, 3 uuencoded figures

We study exact renormalization group equations in the framework of theeffective average action. We present analytical approximate solutions for thescale dependence of the potential in a variety of models. These solutionsdisplay a rich spectrum of physical behaviour such as fixed points governingthe universal behaviour near second order phase transitions, criticalexponents, first order transitions (some of which are radiatively induced) andtricritical behaviour.
