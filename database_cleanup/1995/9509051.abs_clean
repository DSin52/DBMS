Title: Mirror symmetry of elliptic curves and Ising model

Comments: 31 pages, Latex

We study the differential equations governing mirror symmetry of ellipticcurves, and obtain a characterization of the ODEs which give rise to theintegral ${\bf q}$-expansion of mirror maps. Through theta functionrepresentation of the defining equation, we express the mirror correspondencein terms of theta constants. By investigating the elliptic curves in$X_9$-family, the identification of the Landau-Ginzburg potential with thespectral curve of Ising model is obtained. Through the Jacobi elliptic functionparametrization of Boltzmann weights in the statistical model, an exact Jacobiform-like formula of mirror map is described .
