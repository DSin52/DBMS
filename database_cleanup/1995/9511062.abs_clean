Starting from the generating functional of the theory of relativistic spinorsin 2+1 dimensions interacting through the pure Chern-Simons gauge field, theS-matrix is constructed and seen to be formally the same as that of spinorquantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with Feynman diagrams having externalphoton lines excluded, and with the propagator of the topological Chern-Simonsphoton substituted for the Maxwell photon propagator. It is shown that theabsence of real topological photons in the complete set of vector states of thetotal Hilbert space leads in a given order of perturbation theory totopological unitarity identities that demand the vanishing of thegauge-invariant sum of the imaginary parts of Feynman diagrams with a givennumber of internal on-shell free topological photon lines. It is also shown,that these identities can be derived outside the framework of perturbationtheory. The identities are verified explicitly for the scattering of afermion-antifermion pair in one-loop order.
