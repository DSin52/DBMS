A variety of unitary gauges for perturbation theory in a background field isconsidered in order to find those most suitable for a Hamiltonian treatment ofthe system. We select two convenient gauges and derive the propagators$D_{\mu\nu}$ for gluonic quantum fluctuations immersed in backgroundconfigurations. The first one is a unitary generalization of the usual Coulombgauge in QED which preserves the decoupling of two propagating polarizationsfrom the instantaneous one. The second possibility is the axial light conegauge which remains ghost free also in the presence of a background.Applications of the formalism to the spectrum and dynamics of QCD at theconfinement scale, such as hybrid states, are briefly discussed.
