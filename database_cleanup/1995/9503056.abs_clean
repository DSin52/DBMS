Title: A square root of the harmonic oscillator

Authors: R Delbourgo

Comments: RevTex, 10 pages in preprint form, no figures

Allowing for the inclusion of the parity operator, it is possible to constructan oscillator model whose Hamiltonian admits an EXACT square root, which isdifferent from the conventional approach based on creation and annihilationoperators. We outline such a model, the method of solution and somegeneralizations.
