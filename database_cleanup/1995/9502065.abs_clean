Four-dimensional string backgrounds with local realizations of N = 4world-sheet supersymmetry have, in the presence of a rotational Killingsymmetry, only one complex structure which is an SO(2) singlet, while the othertwo form an SO(2) doublet. Although N = 2 world-sheet supersymmetry is alwayspreserved under Abelian T-duality transformations, N = 4 breaks down to N = 2in the rotational case. A non-local realization of N = 4 supersymmetry emerges,instead, with world-sheet parafermions. For SO(3)-invariant metrics of purelyrotational type, like the Taub-NUT and the Atiyah-Hitchin metrics, none of thelocally realized extended world-sheet supersymmetries can be preserved undernon-Abelian duality.
