Title: Planckian Scattering and Shock Wave Mixing in General Relativity and

Dilaton GravityComments: 26 pages, no figures, World Scientific Tex macros included. Based on

invited talk delivered at the Conference on Planck Scale Physics held duringDecember 12-21, 1994 at Puri, India.Point particle scattering at Planckian centre-of-mass (cm) energies and lowfixed momentum transfers, occurring due both to electromagnetic andgravitational interactions, is surveyed, with particular emphasis on the novelfeatures occurring in electromagnetic charge-monopole scattering. The issue ofpossible mixing of the shock waves occurring due to both kinds of interactionsis then addressed within the framework of Einsteinian general relativity andthe dilatonic extension suggested by string theory.
