We consider the semiclassical dynamics of CGHS black holes with aWeyl-invariant effective action for conformal matter. The trace anomaly ofPolyakov effective action is converted into the Virasoro anomaly thus leadingto the same flux of Hawking radiation. The covariance of semiclassicalequations can be restored through a non-local redefinition of themetric-dilaton fields. The resulting theory turns out to be equivalent to theRST model. This provides a mechanism to solve semiclassical equations of 2Ddilaton gravity coupled to conformal matter for classically soluble models.
