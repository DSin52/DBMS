We calculate the beta-functions of the general massive (p,q) supersymmetricsigma model to two loop order using (1,0) superfields. The conditions forfiniteness are discussed in relation to (p,q) supersymmetry. We also calculatethe effective potential using component fields to one loop order and considerthe possibility of perturbative breaking of supersymmetry. The effect of oneloop finite local counter terms and the ultra-violet behaviour of the off-shell(p,q) models to all orders in perturbation theory are also addressed.
