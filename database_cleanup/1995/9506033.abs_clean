The $\kappa$--anomaly cancellation mechanism in the heterotic superstringdetermines the superspace constraints for N=1, D=10Supergravity--Super--Yang--Mills theory. We point out that the constraintsfound recently in this way appear to disagree with superspace solutions foundin the past. We solve this puzzle establishing perfect agreement between thetwo methods.
