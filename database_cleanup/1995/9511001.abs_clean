Gauge Field as Anomalous Gauge TheoryAuthors: M.Koseki, R.Kuriki

The massless Schwinger model without the kinetic term of gauge field hasgauge anomaly. We quantize the model as an anomalous gauge theory in the mostgeneral class of gauge conditions. We show that the gauge field becomes adynamical variable because of gauge anomaly.
