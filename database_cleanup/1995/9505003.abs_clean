We show that if actions more general than the usual simple plaquette action($\sim F_{\mu\nu}^2$) are considered, then compact $U(1)$ {\sl pure} gaugetheory in three Euclidean dimensions can have two phases. Both phases areconfining phases, however in one phase the monopole condensate spontaneously`magnetizes'. For a certain range of parameters the phase transition iscontinuous, allowing the definition of a strong coupling continuum limit. Wenote that these observations have relevance to the `fictitious' gauge fieldtheories of strongly correlated electron systems, such as those describinghigh-$T_c$ superconductors.
