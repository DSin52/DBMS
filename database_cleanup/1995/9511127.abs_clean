Title: Matrix Models, Quantum Penner Action and Two-Dimensional String Theory

Comments: Latex file, 8 pages. Based on a talk given by the second author at

the NATO ASI, Cargese, July 11-25 1995A very elementary model of a single positive hermitian random matrix coupledto an external matrix is defined and studied. Expanding the exact effectiveaction around its classical solution leads to the ``quantum Penner action'',from which a rich structure of correlation functions is obtained. These areshown to be equal to the all-orders perturbative expansion of tachyonamplitudes in the two-dimensional string at self-dual radius.
