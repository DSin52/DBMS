Title: Phase operator for the photon, an index theorem, and quantum anomaly

Comments: To be published in the Proceedings of International Symposium on

Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, Tokyo, 1995An index relation $dim\ ker\ a - dim\ ker\ a^{\dagger} = 1$ is satisfied bythe creation and annihilation operators $a^{\dagger}$ and $a$ of a harmonicoscillator. Implications of this analytic index on the possible form of thephase operator are discussed. A close analogy between the present phaseoperator problem and chiral anomaly in gauge theory, which is associated withAtiyah-Singer index theorem, is emphasized.
