The structure of on-shell and off-shell 2D, (4,4) supersymmetric scalarmultiplets is investigated, in components and in superspace. We reach thesurprising result that there exist eight {\underline {distinct}} on-shellversions and an even greater variety of off-shell ones. The off-shellgeneralised tensor and relaxed N = 4 multiplets are introduced in superspace,and their universal invariant self-interaction is constructed.
