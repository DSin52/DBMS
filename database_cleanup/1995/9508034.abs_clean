One Lagrangian BRST quantization principle is that of imposing correctSchwinger-Dyson equations through the BRST Ward identities. In this paper weshow how to derive the analogous $Sp(2)$-symmetric quantization condition inflat coordinates from an underlying $Sp(2)$-symmetric Schwinger-Dyson BRSTsymmetry. We also show under what conditions this can be recast in the languageof triplectic quantization.
