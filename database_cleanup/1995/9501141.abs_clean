It is shown that several Hamiltonian systems possessing dynamical or hiddensymmetries can be realized within the framework of Nambu's generalizedmechanics. Among such systems are the SU(n)-isotropic harmonic oscillator andthe SO(4)-Kepler problem. As required by the formulation of Nambu dynamics, theintegrals of motion for these systems necessarily become the so-calledgeneralized Hamiltonians. Furthermore, in most of these problems, thedefinition of these generalized Hamiltonians is not unique.
