A generalization of the non-Abelian version of the $CP^{N-1}$ models (alsoknown as Grassmannian models) is presented. The generalization helpsaccommodate a partial breaking of the non-Abelian gauge symmetry. Constituentsof the composite gauge fields, in many cases, are naturally constrained tobelong to an anomaly free representation which in turn generates a compositescalar simulating Higgs mechanism to break the gauge symmetry dynamically forand the other on SO(10). Breakings such as SU(2)$\to$U(1) orSO(10)$\to$SU(5)$\times$U(1) are found feasible. Properties of the compositesfields and gauge boson masses are computed by doing a derivative expansion ofthe large $N$ effective action.
