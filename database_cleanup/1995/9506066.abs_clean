The quantum corrections to black hole entropy, variously defined, sufferquadratic divergences reminiscent of the ones found in the renormalization ofthe gravitational coupling constant (Newton constant). We consider thesuggestion, due to Susskind and Uglum, that these divergences are proportional,and attempt to clarify its precise meaning. Using a Euclidean formulation theproportionality is a fairly immediate consequence of basic principles -- alow-energy theorem. Thus in this framework renormalizing the Newton constantrenders the entropy finite, and equal to its semiclassical value. As a partialcheck on our formal arguments we compare the one loop determinants, calculatedusing heat kernel regularization. An alternative definition of black holeentropy relates it to behavior at conical singularities in two dimensions, andthus to a suitable definition of geometric entropy. Geometric entropy permitsthe same renormalization, but it does not yield an intrinsically positivequantity. For scalar fields geometric entropy is subtly sensitive to curvedspace couplings, even in the limit of flat space. Fermions and gauge fields areconsidered as well. Their functional determinants are closely related to thedeterminants for non-minimally coupled scalar fields with specific values forthe curvature coupling, and pose no further difficulties.
