Title: An Explicit Construction of Self-dual 2-forms in Eight Dimensions

Authors: Ayse Humeyra Bilge, Tekin Dereli, Sahin Kocak

The geometry of self-dual 2-forms in eight dimensions is studied. These2-forms determine an $n^2-n+1$ dimensional manifold ${\cal S}_{2n}$. We provethat for add $n$, it has only one dimensionallinear subspaces. In eightdimensions, the self-dual forms of Corrigan et al constitue a seven dimensionallinear subspace of ${\cal S}_8$, among many other intersting linear subspaces.
