Covariant quantization of theories based on nonlinear extensions of Liealgebras in $2d$ is studied by using a generalized Lagrangian BRST formalism.The quantum action is constructed to be invariant under the off--shellnilpotent BRST transformations by using a set of independent antifields asauxiliary, nonpropagating variables in the quantum theory. The general resultsare applied to the quantization of nonlinear gauge theory based on quadraticPoincar\'e algebra, which is closely related to $2d$ gravity with dynamicaltorsion.
