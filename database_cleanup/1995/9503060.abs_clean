A general description of string excitations in stationary spacetimes isdeveloped. If a stationary string passes through the ergosphere of a4-dimensional black hole, its world-sheet describes a 2-dimensional black (orwhite) hole with horizon coinciding with the static limit of the 4-dimensionalblack hole. Mathematical results for 2-dimensional black holes can therefore beapplied to physical objects (say) cosmic strings in the vicinity of Kerr blackholes. An immediate general result is that the string modes are thermallyexcited. The string excitations are determined by a coupled system of scalarfield equations in the world-sheet metric. In the special case of excitationspropagating along a stationary string in the equatorial plane of theKerr-Newman black hole, they reduce to the $s$-wave scalar field equations inthe 4-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. We briefly discusspossible applications of our results to the black hole information puzzle.
