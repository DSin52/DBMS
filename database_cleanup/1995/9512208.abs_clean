A perturbative renormalization group (RG) scheme for light-front Hamiltonianis formulated on the basis of the Bloch-Horowitz effective Hamiltonian, andapplied to the simplest $\phi^4$ model with spontaneous breaking of the $Z_2$symmetry. RG equations are derived at one-loop order for both symmetric andbroken phases. The equations are consistent with those calculated in thecovariant perturbation theory. For the symmetric phase, an initial cutoffHamiltonian in the RG procedure is made by excluding the zero mode from thecanonical Hamiltonian with an appropriate regularization. An initial cutoffHamiltonian for the broken phase is constructed by shifting $\phi$ as $\phi\rightarrow\phi-v$ in the initial Hamiltonian for the symmetric phase. Theshifted value $v$ is determined on a renormalization trajectory. The minimum ofthe effective potential occurs on the trajectory.
