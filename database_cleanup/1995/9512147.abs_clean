We construct collective field theories associated with one-matrix plus $r$vector models. Such field theories describe the continuum limit of spinCalogero Moser models. The invariant collective fields consist of a scalardensity coupled to a set of fields in the adjoint representation of $U(r)$.Hermiticity conditions for the general quadratic Hamiltonians lead to a newtype of extended non-linear algebra of differential operators acting on theJacobian. It includes both Virasoro and $SU(r)$ (included in $sl(r, {\bf C})\times sl(r, {\bf C})$) current algebras. A systematic construction of exacteigenstates for the coupled field theory is given and exemplified.
