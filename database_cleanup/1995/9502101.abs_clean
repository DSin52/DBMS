Two dimensional quantum R$^2$-gravity and its phase structure are examined inthe semiclassical approach and compared with the results of the numericalsimulation. Three phases are succinctly characterized by the effective action.A classical solution of R$^2$-Liouville equation is obtained by use of thesolution of the ordinary Liouville equation. The partition function is obtainedanalytically. A toatal derivative term (surface term) plays an important rolethere. It is shown that the classical solution can sufficiently account for thecross-over transition of the surface property seen in the numerical simulation.
