Title: Resolution of the strong CP and U(1) problems

Comments: Latex file, 9 pages, no figure

Definition of the determinant of Euclidean Dirac operator in the nontrivialsector of gauge fields suffers from an inherent ambiguity. The popularOsterwalder-Schrader (OS) recipe for the conjugate Dirac field leads to theoption of a vanishing determinant. We propose a novel representation for theconjugate field which depends linearly on the Dirac field and yields anonvanishing determinant in the nontrivial sector. Physics, it appears, choosesthis second option becuase the novel representation leads to a satisfactoryresolution of two outstanding problems, the strong CP and U(1) problems,attributed to instanton effects.
