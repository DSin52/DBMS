We consider a completely integrable lattice regularization of the sine-Gordonmodel with discrete space and continuous time. We derive a determinantrepresentation for a correlation function which in the continuum limit turnsinto the correlation function of local fields. The determinant is then embeddedinto a system of integrable integro-differential equations. The leadingasymptotic behaviour of the correlation function is described in terms of thesolution of a Riemann Hilbert Problem (RHP) related to the system ofintegro-differential equations. The leading term in the asymptoticaldecomposition of the solution of the RHP is obtained.
