Spacesdell'Universit\`a and INFN Sezione di Lecce, Lecce, Italy)Comments: LaTeX format, 31 pages

We show that the classical non-abelian pure Chern-Simons action is related tononrelativistic models in (2+1)-dimensions, via reductions of the gaugeconnection in Hermitian symmetric spaces. In such models the matter fields arecoupled to gauge Chern-Simons fields, which are associated with the isotropysubgroup of the considered symmetric space. Moreover, they can be related tocertain (integrable and non-integrable) evolution systems, as the Ishimori andthe Heisenberg model. The main classical and quantum properties of thesesystems are discussed in connection with the topological field theory and thecondensed matter physics.
