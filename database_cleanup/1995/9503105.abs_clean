We present a topological quantum field theory which corresponds to the moduliproblem associated to Witten's monopole equations for four-manifolds. Theconstruction of the theory is carried out in purely geometrical terms using theMathai-Quillen formalism, and the corresponding observables are described.These provide a rich set of new topological quantites.
