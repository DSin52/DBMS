transmissionWe classify nonultralocal Poisson brackets for 1-dimensional lattice systemsand describe the corresponding regularizations of the Poisson bracket relationsfor the monodromy matrix . A nonultralocal quantum algebras on the lattices forthese systems are constructed.For some class of such algebras anultralocalization procedure is proposed.The technique of the modifiedBethe-Anzatz for these algebras is developed.This technique is applied to thenonlinear sigma model problem.
