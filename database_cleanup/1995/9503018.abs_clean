461-466The third Poisson structure of KdV equation in terms of canonical ``freefields'' and reduced WZNW model is discussed. We prove that it is``diagonalized'' in the Lagrange variables which were used before informulation of 2D gravity. We propose a quantum path integral for KdVequation based on this representation.
