We present a new form of Quantum Electrodynamics where the photons arecomposites made out of zero-dimensional scalar ``primitives''. The r\^{o}le ofthe local gauge symmetry is taken over by an {\em infinite-dimensional globalNoether symmetry} -- the group of volume-preserving (symplectic)diffeomorphisms of the target space of the scalar primitives. Similarconstruction is carried out for higher antisymmetric tensor gauge theories.Solutions of Maxwell's equations are automatically solutions of the new system.However, the latter possesses additional non-Maxwell solutions which displayof electromagnetic self-energy for electron plane wave solutions, and (c) gaugeinvariant photon mass generation, where the generated mass is arbitrary.
