The one-loop anomalies for chiral $W_{3}$ gravity are derived using theFujikawa regularisation method. The expected two-loop anomalies are thenobtained by imposing the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions on the one-loopresults. The anomalies found in this way agree with those already known fromexplicit Feynman diagram calculations. We then directly verify that the order$\hbar^2$ non-local BRST Ward identity anomalies, arising from the ``dressing''of the one-loop results, satisfy Lam's theorem. It is also shown that in arigorous calculation of $Q^2$ anomaly for the BRST charge, one recovers boththe non-local as well as the local anomalies. We further verify that, in chiralgravities, the non-local anomalies in the BRST Ward identity can be obtained bythe application of the anomalous operator $Q^2$, calculated using operatorproducts, to an appropriately defined gauge fermion. Finally, we give argumentsto show why this relation should hold generally in reparametrisation-invarianttheories.
