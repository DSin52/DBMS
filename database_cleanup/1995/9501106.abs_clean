An argument is presented for the inconsistency of black hole remnants whichstore the information which falls into black holes. Unlike previous argumentsit is not concerned with a possible divergence in the rate of pair production.It is argued that the existence of remnants in the thermal atmosphere ofRindler space will drive the renormalized Newton constant to zero.
