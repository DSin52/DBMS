We show that QCD$_2$ on 2D pseudo-manifolds is consistent with the Gross-Taylorstring picture. It allows us to introduce a model describing theone-dimensional evolution of the QCD$_2$ string (in the sense that QCD$_2$itself is regarded as a zero-dimensional system). The model is shown to possessthe third order phase transition associated with the $c=1$ Bose string belowwhich it becomes equivalent to the vortex-free sector of the 1-dimensionalmatrix model. We argue that it could serve as a toy model for theglueball-threshold behavior of multicolor QCD.
