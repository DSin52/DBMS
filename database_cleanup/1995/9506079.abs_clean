In topological field theories determinants of maps with negative as well aspositive eigenvalues arise. We give a generalisation of the zeta-regularisationtechnique to derive expressions for the phase and scaling-dependence of thesedeterminants. For theories on odd-dimensional manifolds a simple formula forthe scaling dependence is obtained in terms of the dimensions of certaincohomology spaces. This enables a non-perturbative feature of Chern-Simonsgauge theory to be reproduced by path-integral methods.
