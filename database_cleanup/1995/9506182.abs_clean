We consider corrections to the entropy of a black hole from an $O(N)$invariant linear $\s$-model. We obtain the entropy from a $1/N$ expansion ofthe partition function on a cone. The entropy arises from diagrams which areanalogous to those introduced by Susskind and Uglum to explain black holeentropy in string theory. The interpretation of the \sm entropy depends onscale. At short distances, it has a state counting interpretation, as theentropy of entanglement of the $N$ fields $\pa$. In the infrared, the effectivetheory has a single composite field $\s \sim \pa \pa$, and the state countinginterpretation of the entropy is lost.
