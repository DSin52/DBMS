We show that Dirichlet-branes, extended objects defined by mixedDirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions in string theory, break half of thesupersymmetries of the type~II superstring and carry a complete set of electricand magnetic Ramond-Ramond charges. We also find that the product of theelectric and magnetic charges is a single Dirac unit, and that the quantum ofcharge takes the value required by string duality. This is strong evidence thatthe Dirchlet-branes are intrinsic to type II string theory and are theRamond-Ramond sources required by string duality. We also note the existence ofa previously overlooked 9-form potential in the IIa string, which gives rise toan effective cosmological constant of undetermined magnitude.
