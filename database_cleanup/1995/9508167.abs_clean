Title: On two complementary approaches aiming at the definition of the

determinant of an elliptic partial differential operatorAuthors: E. Elizalde

Comments: LaTeX file, 9 pages, no figures

We bring together two apparently disconnected lines of research (ofmathematical and of physical nature, respectively) which aim at the definition,through the corresponding zeta function, of the determinant of a differentialoperator possessing, in general, a complex spectrum. It is shown explicitly howthe two lines have in fact converged to a meeting point at which the precisemathematical conditions for the definition of the zeta function and theassociated determinant are easy to understand from the considerations coming upfrom the physical approach, which proceeds by stepwise generalization startingfrom the most simple cases of physical interest. An explicit formula thatestablishes the bridge between the two approaches is obtained.
