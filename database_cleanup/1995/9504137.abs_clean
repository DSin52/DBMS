Odd time was introduced to formulate the Batalin-Vilkovisky method ofquantization of gauge theories in a systematic manner. This approach ispresented emphasizing the odd time canonical formalism beginning from an oddtime Lagrangian. To let the beginners have access to the method essentialnotions of the gauge theories are briefly discussed, and each step isillustrated with examples. Moreover, the method of solving the master equationin an easy way for a class of gauge theories is reviewed. When this method isapplicable some properties of the solutions can easily be extracted as shown inthe related examples.
