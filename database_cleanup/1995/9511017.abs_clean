``Gauge theories, applied supersymmetry and quantum gravity'', Leuven, July1995The topological twist of N=2, D=4 matter-coupled supergravities requires asuitable R-symmetry. This symmetry is realised in the effective supergravitiesarising at tree level from certain heterotic compactifications. The set ofinstanton equations (topological gauge-fixings) is thus obtained. Theconditions that R-symmetry should satisfy also when these theories are replacedby their ``exact'' quantum-corrected counterparts are investigated.
