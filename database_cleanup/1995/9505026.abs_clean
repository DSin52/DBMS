New formulations of the solutions of N=1 and N=2 super Toda field theory areintroduced, using Hamiltonian Reduction of the N=1 and N=2 super WZNW Models tothe super Toda Models. These parameterisations are then used to present theHamiltonian formulations of the super Toda theories on the spaces of solutions.
