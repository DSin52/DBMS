Low-energy effective field theories arising from Calabi-Yau stringcompactifications are generically inconsistent or ill-defined at the classicallevel because of conifold singularities in the moduli space. It is shown, givena plausible assumption on the degeneracies of black hole states, that for typethe singularities are resolved by the appearance of massless Ramond-Ramondblack holes. The Wilsonian effective action including these light black holesis smooth near the conifold, and the singularity is reproduced when they areintegrated out. In order for a quantum effect to cure a classicalinconsistency, it can not be suppressed by the usual string coupling $g_s$. Itis shown how the required $g_s$ dependence arises as a result of the peculiarcouplings of Ramond-Ramond gauge fields to the dilaton.
