Title: `Null gauged' WZNW theories and Toda-like $\sigma$-models

Comments: 14 pages, harvmac TeX, Talk presented at 28th International Symposium

on the Elementary Particles Physics, Wendisch-Rietz, September 1994A new method of gauging of WZNW models is presented, leading to a class ofexact string solutions with a target space metric of Minkowskian signature. Thecorresponding models may be interpreted as $\sigma$-model analogues of the Todafield theories.
