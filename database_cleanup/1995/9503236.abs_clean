We propose a new fractional statistics for arbitrary dimensions, based on anextension of Pauli's exclusion principle, to allow for finite multi-occupanciesof a single quantum state. By explicitly constructing the many-body Hilbertspace, we obtain a new algebra of operators and a new thermodynamics. The newstatistics is different from fractional exclusion statistics; and in a certainlimit, it reduces to the case of parafermi statistics.
