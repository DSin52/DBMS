Title: On S-Duality in Abelian Gauge Theory

Comments: 32 pages, harvmac

U(1) gauge theory on ${\bf R}^4$ is known to possess an electric-magneticduality symmetry that inverts the coupling constant and extends to an action of$SL(2,{\bf Z})$. In this paper, the duality is studied on a generalfour-manifold and it is shown that the partition function is not amodular-invariant function but transforms as a modular form. This result playsan essential role in determining a new low-energy interaction that arises whenN=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is formulated on a four-manifold; thedetermination of this interaction gives a new test of the solution of the modeland would enter in computations of the Donaldson invariants of four-manifoldswith $b_2^+\leq 1$. Certain other aspects of abelian duality, relevant tomatters such as the dependence of Donaldson invariants on the secondStieffel-Whitney class, are also analyzed.
