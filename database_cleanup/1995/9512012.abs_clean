In this paper, we give a construction of $p$-brane solitons in all maximalsupergravity theories in $4\le D \le 11$ dimensions that are obtainable from$D=11$ supergravity by dimensional reduction. We first obtain the full bosonicLagrangians for all these theories in a formalism adapted to the $p$-branesoliton construction. The solutions that we consider involve one dilaton fieldand one antisymmetric tensor field strength, which are in general linearcombinations of the basic fields of the supergravity theories. We also studythe supersymmetry properties of the solutions by calculating the eigenvalues ofthe Bogomol'nyi matrices, which are derived from the commutators of thesupercharges. We give an exhaustive list of the supersymmetric $p$-branesolutions using field strengths of all degrees $n=4,3,2,1$, and thenon-supersymmetric solutions for $n=4,3,2$. As well as studying elementary andsolitonic solutions, we also discuss dyonic solutions in $D=6$ and $D=4$. Inparticular, we find that the Bogomol'nyi matrices for the supersymmetricmassless dyonic solutions have indefinite signature.
