Journal-ref: Phys. Lett. B363 (1995) 65

The recently proposed expression for the general three point function ofexponential fields in quantum Liouville theory on the sphere is considered. Byexploiting locality or crossing symmetry in the case of those four-pointfunctions, which may be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions, a setof functional equations is found for the general three point function. It isshown that the expression proposed by the Zamolodchikovs solves thesefunctional equations and that under certain assumptions the solution is unique.
