Title: A Basis for Invariants in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories

Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX, talk presented at the AIHENP-95 workshop, Pisa

(Italy), April 1995, revised version of the proceedings contributionAn algorithm is described to convert Lorentz and gauge invariant expressionsin non--Abelian gauge theories with matter into a standard form, consisting ofa linear combination of basis invariants. This algorithm is needed for computercalculations of effective actions. The defining properties of the basisinvariants are reported. The number of basis invariants up to mass dimension 16are presented.
