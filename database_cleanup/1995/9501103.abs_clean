The physical phase space of the relativistic top, as defined by Hanson andRegge, is expressed in terms of canonical coordinates of the Poincar\'e groupmanifold. The system is described in the Hamiltonian formalism by the massshell condition and constraints that reduce the number of spin degrees offreedom. The constraints are second class and are modified into a set of firstclass constraints by adding combinations of gauge fixing functions. TheBatalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV) method is then applied to quantize the systemin the path integral formalism in Hamiltonian form. It is finally shown thatdifferent gauge choices produce different equivalent forms of the constraints.
