The study of factorization in linearized gravity is extended to the gravitonscattering processes with an electron for the massive vector boson productionssuch as $g e \rightarrow Z e$ and $g e \rightarrow W \nu_e$. It is shown thatevery transition amplitude is completely factorized due to gravitational gaugeinvariance and Lorentz invariance. Also the explicit values of vector bosonpolarizations are obtained.
