In Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism a classical mechanical system is specified bymeans of a solution to the {\sl classical master equation}. Geometrically sucha solution can be considered as a $QP$-manifold, i.e. a super\m equipped withan odd vector field $Q$ obeying $\{Q,Q\}=0$ and with $Q$-invariant oddsymplectic structure. We study geometry of $QP$-manifolds. In particular, wedescribe some construction of $QP$-manifolds and prove a classification theorem(under certain conditions).We apply these geometric constructions to obtain in natural way the actionfunctionals of two-dimensional topological sigma-models and to show that theChern-Simons theory in BV-formalism arises as a sigma-model with target space$\Pi {\cal G}$. (Here ${\cal G}$ stands for a Lie algebra and $\Pi$ denotesparity inversion.)
