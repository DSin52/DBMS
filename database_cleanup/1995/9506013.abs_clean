The idea of the effective topological theory for high-energy scatteringproposed by H. and E. Verlinde is applied to the $(2+1)$ dimensional gravitywith Einstein action plus Chern-Simons terms. The calculational steps in thetopological description are compared with the eikonal approximation. It isshown that the Lagrangian of the effective topological theory turns out tovanish except for boundary terms.
