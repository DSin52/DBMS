The massive scalar field with $\lambda\varphi^4$ interaction placed in$(3+1)$ dimensional box is considered. The sizes of the box are $V\times \beta$$(V=L^3$ is the volume, $T=1/\beta$ is the temperature). The free energy isevaluated up to the 2nd order of $PT$. The averaging on the vacuum fluctuationsis separated from the averaging on the thermal fluctuations explicitly. Asresult the free-energy is expressed through the scattering amplitudes. We findthat in 3-loop approximation the expression for free energy coincides with theansatz of Bernstein, Dashen, Ma suggested on the base of $S$-matrix formulationof statistical mechanics. The obtained expressions are generalized for higherorder of $PT$.
