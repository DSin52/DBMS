We discuss hypersurface motions in Riemannian manifolds whose normal velocityis a function of the induced hypersurface volume element and derive a secondorder partial differential equation for the corresponding time function$\tau(x)$ at which the hypersurface passes the point $x$. Equivalently, thesemotions may be described in a Hamiltonian formulation as the singlet sector ofcertain diffeomorphism invariant field theories. At least in some (infiniteclass of) cases, which could be viewed as a large-volume limit of Euclidean$M$-branesmoving in an arbitrary $M+1$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, thelinear (with $\tau(x)$ a harmonic function on the embedding Riemannianmanifold). We explicitly compute solutions to the large volume limit ofEuclidean membrane dynamics in $\Real^3$ by methods used in electrostatics andpoint out an additional gradient flow structure in $\Real^n$. In theHamiltonian formulation we discover infinitely many hierarchies of integrable,multidimensional, $N$-component theories possessing infinitely manydiffeomorphism invariant, Poisson commuting, conserved charges.
