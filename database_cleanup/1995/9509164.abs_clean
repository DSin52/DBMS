We introduce an approach for calculating the quantum loop corrections in the$\phi^4$ theory. Differential regularization and background-field method areessential tools and are used to calculate the effective action of the theory totwo-loop order. Our approach is considerably simpler than other known methodsand can be readily extended to higher-loop calculations and to other models.
