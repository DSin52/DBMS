The complete renormalization procedure of a general N=1 supersymmetric gaugetheory in the Wess-Zumino gauge is presented, using the regulator free``algebraic renormalization'' procedure. Both gauge invariance andsupersymmetry are included into one single BRS invariance. The form of thegeneral nonabelian anomaly is given. Furthermore, it is explained how the gaugeBRS and the supersymmetry functional operators can be extracted from thegeneral BRS operator. It is then shown that the supersymmetry operatorsactually belong to the closed, finite, Wess-Zumino superalgebra when theiraction is restricted to the space of the ``gauge invariant operators'', i.e. tothe cohomology classes of the gauge BRS operator.
