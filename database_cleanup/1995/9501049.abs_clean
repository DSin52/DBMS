The 2-point function is the natural object in quantum gravity for extractinggeodesic distance determines the fractal dimension $d_H$ of space-time. Theintegral of the 2-point function determines the entropy exponent $\gamma$, i.e.the fractal structure related to baby universes, while the short distancebehavior of the 2-point function connects $\gamma$ and $d_H$ by a quantumgravity version of Fisher's scaling relation. We verify this behavior in thecase of 2d gravity by explicit calculation.
