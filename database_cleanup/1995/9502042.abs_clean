The study of hidden symmetries within Dirac's formalism does not possess asystematic procedure due to the lack of first-class constraints to act assymmetry generators. On the other hand, in the Faddeev-Jackiw approach, gaugeand reparametrization symmetries are generated by the null eigenvectors of thesympletic matrix and not by constraints, suggesting the possibility of dealingsystematically with hidden symmetries throughout this formalism. It is shown inthis paper that indeed hidden symmetries of noninvariant or gauge fixed systemsare equally well described by null eigenvectors of the sympletic matrix, justas the explicit invariances. The Faddeev-Jackiw approach therefore provides asystematic algorithm for treating all sorts of symmetries in an unified way.This technique is illustrated here by the SL(2,R) affine Lie algebra of the 2-Dinduced gravity proposed by Polyakov, which is a hidden symmetry in thecanonical approach of constrained systems via Dirac's method, after conformaland reparametrization invariances have been fixed.
