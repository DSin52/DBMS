The Higgs-Yukawa model in curved spacetime (renormalizable in the usual sense)is considered near the critical point, employing the $1/N$--expansion andrenormalization group techniques. By making use of the equivalence of thismodel with the standard NJL model, the effective potential in the linearcurvature approach is calculated and the dynamically generated fermionic massis found. A numerical study of chiral symmetry breaking by curvature effects ispresented.
