We present a number of qualitative arguments which strongly suggest thatextremal dyonic black holes in the 4--dimensional low energy, classical fieldtheory limit of toroidally compactified heterotic string theory representlargely degenerate classes of states in the quantum theory. We propose a simpleexpression for the full non--perturbative degeneracy, which contains no freecontinuous parameters and reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking $S={A\over 4G_N}$in the large-area limit (with the ${1\over 4}$ arising from microphysics). Wesupport much hair, such that in counting it we are led to an effective stringtheory, and a matching condition whose solutions give the degeneracy.
