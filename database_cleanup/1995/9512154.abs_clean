We construct a solution to the low-energy string equations of motion in fivedimensions that describes a circular loop of fundamental string exponentiallyexpanding in a background electric $H$-field. Euclideanising this gives aninstanton for the creation of a loop of fundamental string in a background$H$-field, and we calculate the rate of nucleation. Solutions describingmagnetically charged strings and $p$-branes, where the gauge field comes fromKaluza-Klein reduction on a circle, are also constructed. It is known that amagnetic flux tube in four (reduced) spacetime dimensions is unstable to thepair creation of Kaluza-Klein monopoles. We show that in $(4+p)$ dimensions,magnetic $(p+1)$ ``fluxbranes" are unstable to the nucleation of a magneticallycharged spherical $p$-brane. In ten dimensions the instanton describes thenucleation of a Ramond-Ramond magnetically charged six-brane in type IIA stringtheory. We also find static solutions describing spherical charged $p$-branesor fundamental strings held in unstable equilibrium in appropriate backgroundfields. Instabilities of intersecting magnetic fluxbranes are also discussed.
