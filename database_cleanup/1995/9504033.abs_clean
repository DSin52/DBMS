We discuss the relation between the micro-canonical and the canonicalensemble for black holes, and highlight some problems associated with extremeblack holes already at the classical level. Then we discuss the contribution ofquantum fields and demonstrate that the partition functions for scalar andDirac (Majorana) fields in static space-time backgrounds, can be expressed asfunctional integrals in the corresponding optical space, and point out that thedifference between this and the functional integrals in the original metric isa Liouville-type action. The optical method gives both the correction to theblack hole entropy and the bulk contribution to the entropy due to theradiation, while (if the Liouville term is ignored) the conical singularitymethod just gives the divergent contribution to the black hole entropy. Asimple derivation of a general formula for the free energy in thehigh-temperature approximation is given and applied to various cases. Weconclude with a discussion of the second law.
