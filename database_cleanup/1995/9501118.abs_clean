The QED(0+1) model describing a quantum mechanical particle on a circle withminimal electromagnetic interaction and with a potential -M cos(phi - theta_M),which mimics the massive Schwinger model, is discussed as a prototype ofmechanisms and infrared structures of gauge quantum field theories in positivegauges. The functional integral representation displays a complex measure, witha crucial role of the boundary conditions, and the decomposition into thetasectors takes place already in finite volume. In the infinite volume limit, thestandard results are reproduced for M=0 (massless fermions), but one meetsindependently of the lagrangean angle of the topological term, the infinitevolume limit selects the sector with theta = theta_M, and provides a natural"dynamical" solution of the strong CP problem. In comparison with previousapproaches, the strategy discussed here allows to exploit the consequences ofthe theta-dependence of the free energy density, with a unique minimum at theta= theta_M.
