We extend Seiberg's qualitative picture of the behavior of supersymmetric QCDto nonsupersymmetric models by adding soft supersymmetry breaking terms. Inthis way, we recover the standard vacuum of QCD with $N_f$ flavors and $N_c$colors when $N_f < N_c$. However, for $N_f \geq N_c$, we find new exoticstates---new vacua with spontaneously broken baryon number for $N_f = N_c$, anda vacuum state with unbroken chiral symmetry for $N_f > N_c$. These exoticvacua contain massless composite fermions and, in some cases, dynamicallygenerated gauge bosons. In particular Seiberg's electric-magnetic duality seemsto persist also in the presence of (small) soft supersymmetry breaking. Weargue that certain, specially tailored, lattice simulations may be able todetect the novel phenomena. Most of the exotic behavior does not survive thedecoupling limit of large SUSY breaking parameters.
