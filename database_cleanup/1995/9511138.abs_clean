This paper shows that there is a correspondence between quasi-exactlysolvable models in quantum mechanics and sets of orthogonal polynomials $\{P_n\}$. The quantum-mechanical wave function is the generating function for the$P_n (E)$, which are polynomials in the energy $E$. The condition ofquasi-exact solvability is reflected in the vanishing of the norm of allpolynomials whose index $n$ exceeds a critical value $J$. The zeros of thecritical polynomial $P_J(E)$ are the quasi-exact energy eigenvalues of thesystem.
