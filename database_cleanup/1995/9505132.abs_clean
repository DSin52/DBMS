Quantum theory of dilaton gravity coupled to a nonlinear sigma model with amaximally symmetric target space is studied in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions. Theultraviolet stable fixed point for the curvature of the nonlinear sigma modeldemands a new fixed point theory for the dilaton coupling function. The fixedpoint of the dilaton coupling is a saddle point similarly to the previous caseof the flat target space.
