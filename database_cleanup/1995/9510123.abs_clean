We found an infinite number of potentials surrounding 2d black hole.According to the transmission ${\cal T}$ and reflection ${\cal R}$ coefficientsfor scattering of string fields off 2d black hole, we can classify an infinitetypes. We suggest that the discrete states from all the Virasoro levels becandidates for new potentials (modes).
