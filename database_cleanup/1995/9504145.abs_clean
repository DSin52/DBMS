It is argued that black hole condensation can occur at conifold singularitiesin the moduli space of type II Calabi--Yau string vacua. The condensate signalsa smooth transition to a new Calabi--Yau space with different Eulercharacteristic and Hodge numbers. In this manner string theory unifies themoduli spaces of many or possibly all Calabi--Yau vacua. Elementary stringstates and black holes are smoothly interchanged under the transitions, andtherefore cannot be invariantly distinguished. Furthermore, the transitionsestablish the existence of mirror symmetry for many or possibly all Calabi--Yaumanifolds.
