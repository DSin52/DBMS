A consistent approach to the description of integral coordinate invariantfunctionals of the metric on manifolds ${\cal M}_{\alpha}$ with conical defects(or singularities) of the topology $C_{\alpha}\times\Sigma$ is developed.According to the proposed prescription ${\cal M}_{\alpha}$ are considered aslimits of the converging sequences of smooth spaces. This enables one to give astrict mathematical meaning to a number of invariant integral quantities on${\cal M}_{\alpha}$ and make use of them in applications. In particular, anexplicit representation for the Euler numbers and Hirtzebruch signature in thepresence of conical singularities is found. Also, higher dimensional Lovelockgravity on ${\cal M}_{\alpha}$ is shown to be well-defined and thegravitational action in this theory is evaluated. Other series of applicationsis related to computation of black hole entropy in the higher derivativegravity and in quantum 2-dimensional models. This is based on its directstatistical-mechanical derivation in the Gibbons-Hawking approach, generalizedto the singular manifolds ${\cal M}_{\alpha}$, and gives the same results as inthe other methods.
