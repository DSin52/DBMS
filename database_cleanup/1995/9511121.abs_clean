The Dirac Hamiltonian with the Aharonov-Bohm potential provides an example ofa non-Fredholm operator for which all spectral asymmetry comes entirely fromthe continuous spectrum. In this case one finds that the use of standarddefinitions of the resolvent regularized, the heat kernel regularized, and theWitten indices misses the contribution coming from the continuous spectrum andgives vanishing spectral asymmetry and axial anomaly. This behaviour in thecase of the continuous spectrum seems to be general and its origin isdiscussed.
