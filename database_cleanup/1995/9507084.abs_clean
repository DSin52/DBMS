The generalization of Agranovich-Toshich representation of paulion operatorsin terms of bosonic ones for the case of truncated oscillators of higher ranksis represented. We use this generalization to introduce a new constraint freebosonic description of truncated oscillator systems. The correspondingfunctional integral representations for thermodynamic quantities are given andthe application to investigations of Long Rang Order in the system isdiscussed.
