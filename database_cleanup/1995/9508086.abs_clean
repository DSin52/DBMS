We review the definition of the Casimir energy steming naturally from theconcept of functional determinant through the zeta function prescription. Thisis done by considering the theory at finite temperature and by defining thenthe Casimir energy as its energy in the limit $T\to 0$. The ambiguity in thecoefficient $C_{d/2}$ is understood to be a result of the necessaryrenormalization of the free energy of the system. Then, as an exact, explicitexample never calculated before, the Casimir energy for a massive scalar fieldliving in a general $(1+2)$-dimensional toroidal spacetime (i.e., a generalsurface of genus one) with flat spatial geometry ---parametrized by thecorresponding Teichm\"uller parameters--- and its precise dependence on theseparameters and on the mass of the field is obtained under the form of ananalytic function.
