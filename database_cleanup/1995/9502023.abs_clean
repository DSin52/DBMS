gauge field theory, originally due to Faddeev and Shatashvili. It is pointedout that the further non invariance of relevant path integral measures poses aproblem when one tries to translate it to BRST formalism. The method by whichwe propose to get around of this problem introduces certain arbitrariness inthe model. We speculate on the possibility of using such an arbitrariness tobuild series of non equivalent models of two dimensional induced gravity.
