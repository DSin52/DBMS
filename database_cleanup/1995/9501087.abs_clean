The random vector potential model describes massless fermions coupled to aquenched random gauge field. We study its abelian and non-abelian versions. Theabelian version can be completely solved using bosonization. We analyse thenon-abelian model using its supersymmetric formulation and show, by aperturbative renormalisation group computation, that it is asymptotically freeat large distances. We also show that all the quenched chiral currentcorrelation functions can be computed exactly, without using the replica trickor the supersymmetric formulation, but using an exact expression for theeffective action for any sample of the random gauge field. These chiralcorrelation functions are purely algebraic.
