This letter continues the program aimed at analysis of the scalar product ofstates in the Chern-Simons theory. It treats the elliptic case with groupSU(2). The formal scalar product is expressed as a multiple finite dimensionalintegral which, if convergent for every state, provides the space of stateswith a Hilbert space structure. The convergence is checked for states with asingle Wilson line where the integral expressions encode the Bethe-Ansatzsolutions of the Lame equation. In relation to the Wess-Zumino-Witten conformalfield theory, the scalar product renders unitary theKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard connection and gives a pairing between conformalblocks used to obtain the genus one correlation functions.
