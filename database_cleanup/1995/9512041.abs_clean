A model describing the $N=2$ supergravity interaction with vector and linearmultiplets is constructed. It admits the introduction of the spontaneousbreaking of supersymmetry with arbitrary scales, one of which may be equal tozero, which corresponds to partial super-Higgs effect ($N=2 \rightarrow N=1$).A cosmological term is automatically equal to zero.
