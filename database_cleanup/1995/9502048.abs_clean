In the continuum O(3) sigma model in two spatial dimensions, there aretopological solitons whose size can be stabilized by adding Skyrme andpotential terms. This paper describes a lattice version, namely a natural wayof modifying the 2d Heisenberg model to achieve topological stability on thelattice.
