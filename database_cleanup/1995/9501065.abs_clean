Title: GAUGINO CONDENSATES AND CHIRAL-LINEAR DUALITY

ANALYSISAuthors: C. P. Burgess, J.-P. Derendinger, F. Quevedo and M. Quiros

Comments: We have improved our discussion of the case where several factors of

the gauge group condense. We also show that the antisymmetric tensor acquiresa mass in this case in a novel way.Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B348 (1995) 428-442

We show how to formulate the phenomenon of gaugino condensation in asuper-Yang-Mills theory with a field-dependent gauge coupling described with alinear multiplet. We prove the duality equivalence of this approach with themore familiar formulation using a chiral superfield. In so doing, we resolve alongstanding puzzle as to how a linear-multiplet formulation can be consistentwith the dynamical breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry which is thought tooccur once the gauginos condense. In our approach, the composite gauge degreesof freedom are described by a real vector superfield, $V$, rather than thechiral superfield that is obtained in the traditional dual formulation. Ourdualization, when applied to the case of several condensing gauge groups,provides strong evidence that this duality survives strong-coupling effects instring theory.
