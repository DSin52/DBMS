Complete energy spectrum is obtained for the quantum mechanical problem of None dimensional equal mass particles interacting via potential$$V(x_1,x_2,...,x_N) = g\sum^N_{i < j}{1\over (x_i-x_j)^2} - {\alpha\over\sqrt{\sum_{i < j} (x_i-x_j)^2}}$$ Further, it is shown that scatteringconfiguration, characterized by initial momenta $p_i (i=1,2,...,N)$ goes overinto a final configuration characterized uniquely by the final momenta $p'_i$with $p'_i=p_{N+1-i}$.
