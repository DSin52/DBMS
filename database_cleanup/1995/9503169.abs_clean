A procedure of bosonization of Fermions in an arbitrary dimension issuggested. It is shown that a quadratic expression in the fermionic fieldsafter rescaling time $t\to t/\lambda^2$ and performing the limit $\lambda\to0$(stochastic limit), gives rise to a bosonic operator satisfying the bosoncanonical commutation relations. This stochastic bosonization of Fermions isconsidered first for free fields and then for a model with three--linearcouplings. The limiting dynamics of the bosonic theory turns out to bedescribed by means of a quantum stochastic differential equations.
