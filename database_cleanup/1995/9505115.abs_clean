We study a non-Abelian Chern-Simons gauge theory in $ 2+ 1$ dimensions withthe inclusion of an anomalous magnetic interaction. For a particular relationbetween the Chern-Simons (CS) mass and the anomalous magnetic coupling theequations for the gauge fields reduce from second- to first order differentialequations of the pure CS type. We derive the Bogomol'nyi-type or self-dualequations for a $\bphi^2$ scalar potential, when the scalar and topologicalmasses are equal. The corresponding vortex solutions carry magnetic flux thatis not quantized due to the non-toplogical nature of the solitons. However, asa consequence of the quantization of the CS term, both the electric charge andangular momentum are quantized.
