Title: (0,2) String Compactifications

Comments: 20 pages. LaTeX

We present the Higgs mechanism in (0,2) compactifications. The existence of avector bundle data duality (VBDD) in $(0,2)$ compactifications which is presentat the Landau-Ginzburg point allows us to connect in a smooth manner theorieswith different gauge groups with the same base manifold and same number ofeffective generations. As we move along the Kahler moduli space of the theorieswith $E_6$ gauge group, some of the gauginos pick up masses and break the gaugegroup to $SO(10)$ or $SU(5)$.
