We analyze the general class of supersymmetry preserving orbifolds ofstrong/weak Type IIA/heterotic dual pairs in six dimensions and below. Aunified treatment is given by considering compactification to two spacetimedimensions and constructing orbifolds by subgroups of the Fischer-Greissmonster, utilizing the moonshine results of Conway and Norton. Duality requiresnontrivial Ramond-Ramond fluxes on the Type IIA side which are localized at thefixed points. Further orbifolding by (-1)^{F_L} gives examples of new fourdimensional N=2 Type IIA vacua which are not conformal field theorybackgrounds.
