Title: Duality and other Exotic Gauge Dynamics in Softly Broken Supersymmetric

QCDYankielowiczComments: 13 pages

We analyze the theory of softly broken supersymmetric $QCD$. Exotic behaviorlike spontaneously broken baryon number, massless composite fermions andSeiberg's duality seems to persist also in the presence of (small) softsupersymmetry breaking. We argue that certain, specially tailored, latticesimulations may be able to detect the novel phenomena. Most of the exoticbehavior does not survive the decoupling limit of large SUSY breakingparameters.
