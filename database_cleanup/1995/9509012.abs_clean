One loop anomalies and their dependence on antifields for general gaugetheories are investigated within a Pauli-Villars regularization scheme. Foron-shell theories {\it i.e.}, with open algebras or on-shell reducibletheories, the antifield dependence is cohomologically non trivial. Theassociated Wess-Zumino term depends also on antifields. In the classical basisthe antifield independent part of the WZ term is expressed in terms of theanomaly and finite gauge transformations by introducing gauge degrees offreedom as the extra dynamical variables. The complete WZ term is reconstructedfrom the antifield independent part.
