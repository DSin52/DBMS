In this paper, we review various properties of the supersymmetric Two Boson(sTB) system. We discuss the equation and its nonstandard Lax representation.We construct the local conserved charges as well as the Hamiltoniam structuresof the system. We show how this system leads to various other knownsupersymmetric integrable models under appropriate field redefinition. Wediscuss the sTB and the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger (sNLS) equationsas constrained, nonstandard supersymmetric Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (sKP) systemsand point out that the nonstandard sKP systems naturally unify all the KP andmKP flows while leading to a new integrable supersymmetrization of the KPequation. We construct the nonlocal conserved charges associated with the sTBsystem and show that the algebra of charges corresponds to a graded, cubicalgebra. We also point out that the sTB system has a hidden supersymmetrymaking it an $N=2$ extended supersymmetric system.
