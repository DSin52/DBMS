orientationComments: 8 pages, Revtex

Journal-ref: Europhys.Lett. 30 (1995) 255-259

A gauge theory model in which there exists a specific interaction betweeninstantons is considered. An effective action describing this interactionpossesses a minimum when the instantons have identical orientation. Theconsidered interaction might provide a phase transition into the state whereinstantons have a preferred orientation. This phase of the gauge-field theoryis important because it can give the description of gravity in the framework ofthe gauge theory.
