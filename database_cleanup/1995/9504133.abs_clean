Title: The Energy-Momentum Tensor in Field Theory I

Comments: 25 pages, 2 PS figures, uses epsf, harvmac

This is the first of three papers on the short-distance properties of theenergy-momentum tensor in field theory. We study the energy-momentum tensor forrenormalized field theory in curved space. We postulate an exact Ward identityof the energy-momentum tensor. By studying the consistency of the Ward identitywith the renormalization group and diffeomorphisms, we determine theshort-distance singularities in the product of the energy-momentum tensor andan arbitrary composite field in terms of a connection for the space ofcomposite fields over theory space. We discuss examples from thefour-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory. In the forthcoming two papers we plan todiscuss the torsion and curvature of the connection.
