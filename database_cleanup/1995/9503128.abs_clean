I propose an approximation scheme for asymptotically free field theoriescombining both weak coupling and strong coupling series. The weak couplingexpansion is used to integrate the high frequency modes and the resulting lowenergy effective theory is solved using the strong coupling expansion. In somemodels there exists an intermediate scale at which both expansions make sense.The method is tested on few low dimensional models for which an exact solutionis known.
