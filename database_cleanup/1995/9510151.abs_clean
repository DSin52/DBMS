Extending our prior investigation, we give a new off-shell construction oftheories of spinning particles propagating in Minkowski spaces with arbitrary$N$-extended supersymmetry on the world-line. The basis of the new off-shellformulation is provided by realizations of new algebraic structures ${\calG}{\cal R}$(${\rm d}, N$) that are certain generalizations of Pauli algebras.
