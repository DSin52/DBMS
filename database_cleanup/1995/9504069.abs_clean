addedA general fusion method to find solutions to the reflection equation inhigher spin representations starting from the fundamental one is shown. Themethod is illustrated by applying it to obtaining the $K$ diagonal boundarymatrices in an alternating spin $1/2$ and spin $1$ chain. The hamiltonian isalso given. The applicability of the method to higher rank algebras is shown byobtaining the $K$ diagonal matrices for a spin chain in the $\left\{ 3^*\right\}$ representation of $su(3)$ from the $\left\{ 3\right\}$representation.
