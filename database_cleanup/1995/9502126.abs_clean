A generating functional $F$ is found for a canonical nonabelian dualtransformation which maps the supersymmetric chiral O(4) $\sigma$-model to anequivalent supersymmetric extension of the dual $\sigma$-model. This $F$produces a mapping between the classical phase spaces of the two theories inwhich the bosonic (coordinate) fields transform nonlocally, the fermionsundergo a local tangent space chiral rotation, and all currents (fermionic andbosonic) mix locally. Purely bosonic curvature-free currents of the chiralmodel become a {\em symphysis} of purely bosonic and fermion bilinear currentsof the dual theory. The corresponding transformation functional $T$ whichrelates wavefunctions in the two quantum theories is argued to be {\em exactly}given by $T=\exp(iF)$.
