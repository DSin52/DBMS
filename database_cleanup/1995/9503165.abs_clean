We study the BRST-cohomology in the quantum hamiltonian reduction of affineLie algebras of non-simply laced type. We obtain the free field realization ofthe $W{\bf g}$-algebra for $\bg=B_{2}$, $B_{3}$, $C_{3}$ and $G_{2}$. The$WC_{3}$ algebra is shown to be equal to the $WB_{3}$ algebra at the quantumlevel by duality transformation.
