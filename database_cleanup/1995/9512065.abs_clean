Using the collective field technique, we give the description of the spinCalogero-Sutherland Model (CSM) in terms of free bosons. This approach can beapplicable for arbitrary coupling constant and provides the bosonizedHamiltonian of the spin CSM. The boson Fock space can be identified with theHilbert space of the spin CSM in the large $N$ limit. We show that theeigenstates corresponding to the Young diagram with a single row or column arerepresented by the vertex operators. We also derive a dual description of theHamiltonian and comment on the construction of the general eigenstates.
