We show how the supersymmetric properties of three dimensional black holescan be obtained algebraically. The black hole solutions are constructed asquotients of the supergroup $OSp(1|\,2;R)$ by a discrete subgroup of itsisometry supergroup. The generators of the action of the isometry supergroupwhich commute with these identifications are found. These yield thesupersymmetries for the black hole as found in recent studies as well as theusual geometric isometries. It is also shown that in the limit of vanishingcosmological constant, the black hole vacuum becomes a null orbifold, asolution previously discussed in the context of string theory.
