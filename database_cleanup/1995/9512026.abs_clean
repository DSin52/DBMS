Title: Field Anti-Field Duality, p-Form Gauge Fields and Topological Field

TheoriesComments: 19 pages, latex, no figures

We construct a framework which unifyies in dual pairs the fields andanti-fields of the Batalin and Vilkovisky quantization method. We considergauge theories of p-forms coupled to Yang-Mills fields. Our algorithm generatesmany topological models of the Chern-Simon type or of the Donaldson-Wittentype. Some of these models can undergo a partial breaking of their topologicalsymmetries.
