We discuss two issues regarding the question of degrees of freedom in twodimensional string theory. The first issue relates to the classical limit ofquantum string theory. In the classical theory one requires an infinite numberof fields in addition to the collective field to describe ``folds'' on thefermi surface. We argue that in the quantum theory these are not additionaldegrees of freedom. Rather they represent quantum dispersions of the collectivefield which are {\em not} suppressed when $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ whenever a foldis present, thus leading to a nontrivial classical limit. The second issuerelates to the ultraviolet properties of the geometric entropy. We argue thatthe geometric entropy is finite in the ultraviolet due to {\em nonperturbative}effects. This indicates that the true degrees of freedom of the two dimensionalstring at high energies is much smaller than what one naively expects.(Based on talks at Spring Workshop on String theory and Quantum Gravity, ICTP,Trieste, March 1995 and VIIth Regional Conference on Mathematical Physics,Bandar-Anzali, October 1995.)
