Clausthal (Germany) and Razlog (Bulgaria) in August 1995)We review recent progress in formulating two-dimensional models overnoncommutative manifolds where the space-time coordinates enter in theformalism as non-commuting matrices. We describe the Fuzzy sphere and a way toapproximate topological nontrivial configurations using matrix models. Weobtain an ultraviolet cut off procedure, which respects the symmetries of themodel. The treatment of spinors results from a supersymmetric formulation; ourcut off procedure preserves even the supersymmetry.
