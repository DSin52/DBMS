We apply the Batalin-Tyutin Hamiltonian method to the Abelian Proca model inorder to convert a second class constraint system into a first class onesystematically by introducing the new fields. Then, according to the BFVformalism we obtain that the desired resulting Lagrangian preserving standardBRST symmetry naturally includes the well-known St\"ukelberg scalar related tothe explicit gauge-breaking effect due to the presence of the mass term.Furthermore, we also discuss the nonlocal symmetry structure of this model inthe context of the nonstandard BRST symmetry.
