The quantization of isomonodromic deformation of a meromorphic connection onthe torus is shown to lead directly to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernardequations in the same way as the problem on the sphere leads to the system ofKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. The Poisson bracket required for aHamiltonian formulation of isomonodromic deformations is naturally induced bythe Poisson structure of Chern-Simons theory in a holomorphic gauge fixing.This turns out to be the origin of the appearance of twisted quantities on thetorus.
