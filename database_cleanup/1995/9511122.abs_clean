In the present article we display a new constructive quantum field theoryapproach to quantum gauge field theory, utilizing the recent progress in theintegration theory on the moduli space of generalized connections modulo gaugetransformations. That is, we propose a new set of Osterwalder Schrader likeaxioms for the characteristic functional of a measure on the space ofgeneralized connections modulo gauge transformations rather than for theassociated Schwinger distributions. We show non-triviality of our axioms bydemonstrating that they are satisfied for two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory onthe plane and the cylinder. As a side result we derive a closed and analyticalexpression for the vacuum expectation value of an arbitrary product of Wilsonloop functionals from which we derive the quantum theory along the Glimm andJaffe algorithm which agrees exactly with the one as obtained by canonicalmethods.
