The regularization scheme is proposed for the constrained Hamiltonianformulation of the gauge fields coupled to the chiral or axial fermions. TheSchwinger terms in the regularized operator first-class constraint algebra areshown to be consistent with the covariant divergence anomaly of thecorresponding current. Regularized quantum master equations are studied, andthe Schwinger terms are found out to break down both nilpotency of theBRST-charge and its conservation law. Wess-Zumino consistency conditions arestudied for the BRST anomaly and they are shown to contradict to the covariantSchwinger terms in the BRST algebra.
