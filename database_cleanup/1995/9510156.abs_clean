Proceedings of the School "String Gravity and the Planck Energy Scale"(Erice, 8-19 September, 1995) [Because of mistakes created in the mailingprocess the same text was resubmitted several times.]We discuss and compare different definitions of the entropy of a black hole.In particular we show that the thermodynamical entropy defined by the responseof the free energy of a black hole to the change of temperature does notcoincide with the statistical-mechanical entropy, obtained by counting itsdynamical degrees of freedom. The no-boundary wavefunction of a black hole, itsrelation to the entropy problem and its generalization are discussed. Wediscuss the relation between on-shell and off-shell calculations of theentropy, and the role of the renormalization of the gravitational constant.
