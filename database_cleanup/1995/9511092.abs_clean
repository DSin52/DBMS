We introduce an operator version of the BRST-BFV effective action forarbitrary systems with first-class constraints. Using the Schwinger actionnon-relativistic free particle, (ii) the relativistic free particle and (iii)the spining relativistic free particle. Our calculation correctly imposes theBRST-invariance at the end-points. The precise use of the additional boundaryterms required in the description of fermionic variables is also incorporated.
