We present the solution of the problem of the $1/\Box, \Box \to 0,$asymptotic terms discovered in the one-loop form factors of the gravitationaleffective action. Owing to certain constraints among their coefficients, whichwe establish, these terms cancel in the vacuum stress tensor and do notviolate the asymptotic flatness of the expectation value of the metric. Theyreappear, however, in the Riemann tensor of this metric and stand for a newcoherent radiation caused by the backreaction adds to the noncoherent radiationcaused by the pair creation in the case where the initial state provides thevacuum stress tensor with a quadrupole moment.
