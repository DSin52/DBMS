We propose that the ten-dimensional $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string isrelated to an eleven-dimensional theory on the orbifold ${\bf R}^{10}\times{\bf S}^1/{\bf Z}_2$ in the same way that the Type IIA string in ten dimensionsis related to ${\bf R}^{10}\times {\bf S}^1$. This in particular determines thestrong coupling behavior of the ten-dimensional $E_8\times E_8$ theory. It alsoleads to a plausible scenario whereby duality between $SO(32)$ heterotic andType I superstrings follows from the classical symmetries of theeleven-dimensional world, just as the $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ duality of theten-dimensional Type IIB theory follows from eleven-dimensional diffeomorphisminvariance.
