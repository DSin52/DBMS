We present a manifestly $N=2$ supersymmetric formulation of $N=2$super-$W_3^{(2)}$ algebra (its classical version) in terms of the spin 1unconstrained supercurrent generating a $N=2$ superconformal subalgebra and thespins 1/2, 2 bosonic and spins 1/2, 2 fermionic constrained supercurrents. Weconsider a superfield reduction of $N=2$ super-$W_3^{(2)}$ to $N=2$ super-$W_3$and construct a family of evolution equations for which $N=2$ super-$W_3^{(2)}$provides the second hamiltonian structure.
