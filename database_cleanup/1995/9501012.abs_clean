Abstract In this letter we show that the overlap formulation of chiral gaugetheories correctly reproduces the gravitational Lorentz anomaly in2-dimensions. This formulation has been recently suggested as a solution to thefermion doubling problem on the lattice. The well known response to generalcoordinate transformations of the effective action of Weyl fermions coupled togravity in 2-dimensions can also be recovered.
