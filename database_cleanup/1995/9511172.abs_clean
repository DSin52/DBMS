We present a new realization of scalar integrable hierarchies in terms of theToda lattice hierarchy. In other words, we show on a large number of examplesthat an integrable hierarchy, defined by a pseudodifferential Lax operator, canbe embedded in the Toda lattice hierarchy. Such a realization in terms the Todalattice hierarchy seems to be as general as the Drinfeld--Sokolov realization.
