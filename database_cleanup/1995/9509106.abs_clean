We review electric/magnetic duality in $N=4$ (and certain $N=2$) globallysupersymmetric gauge theories and show how this duality, which relates strongto weak coupling, follows as a consequence of a string/string duality. Blackholes, eleven dimensions and supermembranes also have a part to play in the bigpicture.
