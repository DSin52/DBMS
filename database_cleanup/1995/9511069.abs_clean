The interaction of a cosmic string with a four-dimensional stationary blackhole is considered. If a part of an infinitely long string passes close to ablack hole it can be captured. The final stationary configurations of suchcaptured strings are investigated. A uniqueness theorem is proved, namely it isshown that the minimal 2-D surface $\Sigma$ describing a captured stationarystring coincides with a {\it principal Killing surface}, i.e. a surface formedby Killing trajectories passing through a principal null ray of the Kerr-Newmangeometry. Geometrical properties of principal Killing surfaces are investigatedand it is shown that the internal geometry of $\Sigma$ coincides with thegeometry of a 2-D black or white hole ({\it string hole}). The equations forpropagation of string perturbations are shown to be identical with theequations for a coupled pair of scalar fields 'living' in the spacetime of a2-D string hole. Some interesting features of physics of 2-D string holes aredescribed. In particular, it is shown that the existence of the extradimensions of the surrounding spacetime makes interaction possible between theinterior and exterior of a string black hole; from the point of view of the 2-Dgeometry this interaction is acausal. Possible application of this result tothe information loss puzzle is briefly discussed.
