A q-deformed two-dimensional phase space is studied as a model for anoncommutative phase space. A lattice structure arises that can be interpretedas a spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. The eigenfunctions of aHamiltonian that lives on such a lattice are derived as wavefunctions inordinary $x$-space.
