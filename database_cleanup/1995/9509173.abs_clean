We propose to use a novel master Lagrangian for performing the bosonizationof the $D$-dimensional massive Thirring model in $D=d+1 \ge 2$ dimensions. Itis shown that our master Lagrangian is able to relate the previousinterpolating Lagrangians each other which have been recently used to show theequivalence of the massive Thirring model in (2+1) dimensions with theMaxwell-Chern-Simons theory. Starting from the phase-space path integralrepresentation of the master Lagrangian, we give an alternative proof for thisequivalence up to the next-to-leading order in the expansion of the inversefermion mass. Moreover, in (3+1)-dimensional case, the bosonized theory isshown to be equivalent to the massive antisymmetric tensor gauge theory. As abyproduct, we reproduce the well-known result on bosonization of the(1+1)-dimensional Thirring model following the same strategy. Finally apossibility of extending our strategy to the non-Abelian case is alsodiscussed.
