Title: Entropy of Extremal Black Hole Solutions of String Theory

Authors: A. Ghosh and P. Mitra

Comments: 12 pages, harvmac (minor errors corrected)

For extremal black holes, the thermodynamic entropy is not proportional tothe area. The general form allowed by thermodynamics is worked out for threeclasses of extremal black hole solutions of string theory and shown to beconsistent with the entropy calculated from the density of elementary stringstates. On the other hand, the entanglement entropy does not in general agreewith these results.
