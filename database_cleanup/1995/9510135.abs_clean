The recent discovery of an explicit conformal field theory description ofType II $p$-branes makes it possible to investigate the existence of boundstates of such objects. In particular, it is possible with reasonable precisionto verify the prediction that the Type IIB superstring in ten dimensions has afamily of soliton and bound state strings permuted by $SL(2,{\bf Z})$. Thespace-time coordinates enter tantalizingly in the formalism as non-commutingmatrices.
