We define a complete set of supertraces on the algebra $SH_N(\nu)$, thealgebra of observables of the $N$-body rational Calogero model with harmonicinteraction. This result extends the previously known results for the simplestcases of $N=1$ and $N=2$ to arbitrary $N$. It is shown that $SH_N(\nu)$ admits$q(N)$ independent supertraces where $q(N)$ is a number of partitions of $N$into a sum of odd positive integers, so that $q(N)>1$ for $N\ge 3$. Someconsequences of the existence of several independent supertraces of $SH_N (\nu)$ are discussed such as the existence of ideals in associated $W_{\infty}$ -type Lie superalgebras.
