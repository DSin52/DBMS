Title: NAMBU-GOLDSTONE BOSON ON THE LIGHT-FRONT

Comments: To appear in the proceedings of the 13th Symposium on Theoretical

Physics, Mt. Sorak, Korea, from 27 June to 2 July, 1994.Spontaneous breakdown of the continuous symmetry is studied in the framework ofdiscretized light-front quantization. We consider linear sigma model in 3+1dimensions and show that the careful treatment of zero modes together with theregularization of the theory by introducing NG boson mass leads to the correctdescription of Nambu-Goldstone phase on the light-front.
