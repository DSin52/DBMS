A pseudoclassical model is proposed for the description of planar$P,T-$invariant massive fermions. The quantization of the model leads to the(2+1)-dimensional $P,T-$invariant fermion model used recently in$P,T-$conserving theories of high-T${}_c$ superconductors. The rich symmetry ofthe quantum model is elucidated through the analysis of the canonical structureof its pseudoclassical counterpart. We show that both the quantum$P,T-$invariant planar massive fermion model and the proposed pseudoclassicalmodel --- for a particular choice of the parameter appearing in the Lagrangianhidden supersymmetry leads to a non-standard superextension of the(2+1)-dimensional Poincar\'e group. In the quantum theory the one particlestates provide an irreducible representation of the extended supergrouplabelled by the zero eigenvalue of the superspin. We discuss the gaugemodification of the pseudoclassical model and compare our results with thoseobtained from the standard pseudoclassical model for massive planar fermions.
