Title: MIRROR SYMMETRY IN THE FEW ANYON SPECTRA IN A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

POTENTIALAuthors: Ranjan K. Ghosh and Sumathi Rao

Comments: Revtex, 9 pages

We find that the energy spectra of four and five anyons in a harmonicpotential exhibit some mirror symmetric (reflection symmetric about thesemionic statistics point $\theta=\pi/2$) features analogous to the mirrorsymmetry in the two and three anyon spectra. However, since the $\ell=0$ sectorremains non-mirror symmetric, the fourth and fifth virial coeffients do notreflect this symmetry.
