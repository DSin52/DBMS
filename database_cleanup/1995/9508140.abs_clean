We define a weak-strong coupling transformation based on the Legendretransformation of the effective action. In the case of $N\es 2$ supersymmetricYang-Mills theory, this coincides with the duality transform on the low energyeffective action considered by Seiberg and Witten. This Legendre transforminterpretation of duality generalizes directly to the full effective action,and in principle to other theories.
