Exact expressions of the boundary state and the form factors of the Isingmodel are used to derive differential equations for the one-point functions ofthe energy and magnetization operators of the model in the presence of aboundary magnetic field. We also obtain explicit formulas for the masslesslimit of the one-point and two-point functions of the energy operator.
