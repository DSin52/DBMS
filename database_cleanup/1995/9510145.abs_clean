Title: Energy-Momentum Tensor Improvements in Two Dimensions

Authors: S. Deser and R. Jackiw

Comments: 11 pages in REVTeX

We discuss some aspects of the two-dimensional scalar field, consideringparticularly the action for the conformal anomaly as an ``improved''gravitational coupling, and the possibility of introducing a dual coupling,which provides a ``chiral'' energy-momentum tensor improvement.
