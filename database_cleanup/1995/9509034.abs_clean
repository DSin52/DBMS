We discuss several aspects of second quantized scattering operators $\hat S$for fermions in external time dependent fields. We derive our results on ageneral, abstract level having in mind as a main application potentials of theYang--Mills type and in various dimensions. We present a new and powerfulmethod for proving existence of $\hat S$ which is also applicable to othersituations like external gravitational fields. We also give two complementaryderivations of the change of phase of the scattering matrix under generalizedgauge transformations which can be used whenever our method of provingexistence of $\hat S$ applies. The first is based on a causality argument i.e.\$\hat S$ (including phase) is determined from a time evolution, and the secondexploits the geometry of certain infinite-dimensional group extensionsassociated with the second quantization of 1-particle operators. As a specialcase we obtain a Hamiltonian derivation of the the axial Fermion-Yang-Millsanomaly and the Schwinger terms related to it via the descent equations, whichis on the same footing and traces them back to a common root.
