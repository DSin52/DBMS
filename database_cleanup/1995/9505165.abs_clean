A form of the constraints, specifying a $D$-dimensional manifold embedded in$D+1$ dimensional Euclidean space, is discussed in the path integral formulagiven by a time discretization. Although the mid-point prescription isprivileged in the sphere $S^D$ case, it is more involved in generic cases. Aninterpretation on the validity of the formula is put in terms of the operatorformalism. Operators from this path integral formula are also discussed.
