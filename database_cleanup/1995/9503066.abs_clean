We study a quite general family of dynamical $r$-matrices for an auxiliary loopalgebra ${\cal L}({su(2)})$ related to restricted flows for equations of theKdV type. This underlying $r$-matrix structure allows to reconstruct Laxrepresentations and to find variables of separation for a wide set of theintegrable natural Hamiltonian systems. As an example, we discuss theHenon-Heiles system and a quartic system of two degrees of freedom in detail.
