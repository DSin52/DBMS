We propose a new method for the study of the chiral properties of the groundstate in QFT's based on the computation of the probability distributionfunction of the chiral condensate. It can be applied directly in the chirallimit and therefore no mass extrapolations are needed. Furthermore thisapproach allows to write up equations relating the chiral condensate withquantities computable by standard numerical methods, the functional form ofthese relations depending on the broken symmetry group. As a check, we reportsome results for the compact Schwinger model.
