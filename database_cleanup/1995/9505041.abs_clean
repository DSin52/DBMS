We show that the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is abi-Hamiltonian integrable system. We obtain the two Hamiltonian structures ofthe theory from the ones of the supersymmetric two boson hierarchy through afield redefinition. We also show how the two Hamiltonian structures of thesupersymmetric KdV equation can be derived from a Hamiltonian reduction of thesupersymmetric two boson hierarchy as well.
