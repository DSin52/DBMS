In a previous paper \cite{lp}, supersymmetric $p$-brane solutions involvingone dilatonic scalar field in maximal supergravity theories were classified.Although these solutions involve a number of participating field strengths,they are all equal and thus they carry equal electric or magnetic charges. Inthis paper, we generalise all these solutions to multi-scalar solutions inwhich the charges become independent free parameters. The mass per unit$p$-volume is equal to the sum of these Page charges. We find that for genericvalues of the Page charges, they preserve the same fraction of thesupersymmetry as in their single-scalar limits. However, for special values ofthe Page charges, the supersymmetry can be enhanced.
