We examine the thermal behavior of a relativistic anyon system, dynamicallyrealized by coupling a charged massive spin-1 field to a Chern-Simons gaugefield. We calculate the free energy (to the next leading order), from which allthermodynamic quantities can be determined. As examples, the dependence ofparticle density on the anyon statistics and the anyon anti-anyon interferencein the ideal gas are exhibited. We also calculate two and three-pointcorrelation functions, and uncover certain physical features of the system inthermal equilibrium.
