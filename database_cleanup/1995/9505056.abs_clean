In this paper, a novel method is presented for the study of the dependence ofthe functional determinant of the Laplace operator associated to a subbundle$F$ of a hermitian holomorphic vector bundle $E$ over a Riemann surface$\Sigma$ on the hermitian structure $(h,H)$ of $E$. The generalized Weylanomaly of the effective action is computed and found to be expressible interms of a suitable generalization of the Liouville and Donaldson actions. Thegeneral techniques worked out are then applied to the study of a specificmodel, the Drinfeld--Sokolov (DS) ghost system arising in $W$--gravity. Theexpression of generalized Weyl anomaly of the DS ghost effective action isfound. It is shown that, by a specific choice of the fiber metric $H_h$depending on the base metric $h$, the effective action reduces into that of aconformal field theory. Its central charge is computed and found to agree withthat obtained by the methods of hamiltonian reduction and conformal fieldtheory. The DS holomorphic gauge group and the DS moduli space are defined andtheir dimensions are computed.
