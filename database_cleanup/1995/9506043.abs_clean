In this paper we calculate the high--energy quark--quark scatteringamplitude, first in the case of scalar QCD, using Fradkin's approach to derivethe scalar quark propagator in an external gluon field and computing it in theeikonal approximation. (This approach was also recently used by Fabbrichesi,Pettorino, Veneziano and Vilkovisky to study the four--dimensionalPlanckian--energy scattering in gravity.) We then extend the results to thecase of ``real'' ({\it i.e.} fermion) QCD, thus deriving again, in a ratherdirect way, the results previously found by Nachtmann. The abelian case (QED)is also discussed in the Appendix.
