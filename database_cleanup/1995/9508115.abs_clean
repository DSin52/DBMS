We derive an exact expression for the single particle Green function in theCalogero-Sutherland model for all rational values of the coupling $\beta$. Thecalculation is based on Jack polynomial techniques and the results are given inthe thermodynamical limit. Two type of intermediate states contribute. Thefirts one consists of a particle propagating out of the Fermi sea and thesecond one consists of a particle propagating in one direction, q particles inthe opposite direction and p holes.
