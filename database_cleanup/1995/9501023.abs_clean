We relate two integrable models in (1+1) dimensions, namely, multicomponentCalogero-Sutherland model with particles and antiparticles interacting via thehyperbolic potential and the nonrelativistic factorizable $S$-matrix theorywith $SU(N)$-invariance. We find complete solutions of the Yang-Baxterequations without implementing the crossing symmetry, and one of them isidentified with the scattering amplitudes derived from the Schr\"{o}dingerequation of the Calogero-Sutherland model. This particular solution is ofinterest in that it cannot be obtained as a nonrelativistic limit of any knownrelativistic solutions of the $SU(N)$-invariant Yang-Baxter equations.
