This work is a continuation of paper (hep-th/9407146) where the Boltzmannweights for the N-state integrable spin model on the cubic lattice has beenobtained only numerically. In this paper we present the analytical formulae forthis model in a particular case. Here the Boltzmann weights depend on six freeparameters including the elliptic modulus. The obtained solution allows toconstruct a two-parametric family of the commuting two-layer transfer matrices.Presented model is expected to be simpler for a further investigation incomparison with a more general model mentioned above.
