We study the BRST cohomology within a local conformal Lagrangian field theorymodel built on a two dimensional Riemann surface with no boundary. We deal withthe case of the complex structure parametrized by Beltrami differential and thescalar matter fields. The computation of {\em all} elements of the BRSTcohomology is given.
