We review localization techniques for functional integrals which haverecently been used to perform calculations in and gain insight into thestructure of certain topological field theories and low-dimensional gaugetheories. These are the functional integral counterparts of the Mathai-Quillenformalism, the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem, and the Weyl integral formularespectively. In each case, we first introduce the necessary mathematicalbackground (Euler classes of vector bundles, equivariant cohomology, topologyof Lie groups), and describe the finite dimensional integration formulae. Wethen discuss some applications to path integrals and give an overview of therelevant literature. The applications we deal with include supersymmetricquantum mechanics, cohomological field theories, phase space path integrals,and two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory.
