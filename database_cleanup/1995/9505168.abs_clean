Title: More About the Massive Multi-flavor Schwinger Model

Authors: Y. Hosotani

Comments: 6 pages, plain tex, no figure

The massive multi-flavor Schwinger model on a circle is reduced to a finitedimensional quantum mechanics problem. The model sensitively depends on theparameter $mL|\cos\onehalf\theta|$ where $m$, $L$, and $\theta$ are a typicalfermion mass, the volume, and the vacuum angle, respectively.
