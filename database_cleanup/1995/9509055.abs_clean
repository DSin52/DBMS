We investigate 2d gravity quantized in the ADM formulation, where only theloop length $l(z)$ is retained as a dynamical variable of the gravitation, inorder to get an intuitive physical insight of the theory. The effective actionof $l(z)$ is calculated by adding scalar fields of conformal coupling, and theproblems of the critical dimension and the time development of $l$ areaddressed.
