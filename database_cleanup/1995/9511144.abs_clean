The problems of Classical Electrodynamics with the electron equation ofmotion and with non-integrable singularity of its self-field stress tensor arewell known. They are consequences, we show, of neglecting terms that are nulloff the charge world line but that gives a non null contribution on its worldline. The self-field stress tensor of a point classical electron is integrable,there is no causality violation and no conflict with energy conservation in itsequation of motion, and there is no need of any kind of renormalization nor ofany change in the Maxwell's theory for this.(This is part of the paper hep-th/9510160, stripped , for simplicity, ofits non-Minkowskian geometrization of causality and of its discussion aboutthe physical meaning of the Maxwell-Faraday concept of field).
