Title: Turbulence without pressure

Comments: 12 pages

We develop exact field theoretic methods to treat turbulence when the effectof pressure is negligible. We find explicit forms of certain probabilitydistributions, demonstrate that the breakdown of Galilean invariance isresponsible for intermittency and establish the operator product expansion. Wealso indicate how the effects of pressure can be turned on perturbatively.
