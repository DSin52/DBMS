We study quantum effects in five dimensions in heterotic superstring theorycompactified on K_3 x S_1 and analyze the conjecture that its dual effectivetheory is eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified on a Calabi-Yauthreefold. This theory is also equivalent to type II superstring theorycompactified on the same Calabi-Yau manifold, in an appropriate large volumelimit. In this limit the conifold singularity disappears and is replaced by asingularity associated to enhanced gauge symmetries, as naively expected fromthe heterotic description. Furthermore, we exhibit the existence of additionalmassless states which appear in the strong coupling regime of the heterotictheory and are related to a different type of singular points on Calabi-Yauthreefolds.
