In the first part, the induced vacuum spin around an Aharonov-Bohm fluxstring in massless three-dimensional QED is computed explicitly and the resultis shown to agree with a general index theorem. A previous observation in theliterature, that the presence of induced vacuum quantum numbers which are notperiodic in the flux make an integral-flux AB string visible, is reinforced. Inthe second part, a recent discussion of chiral symmetry breaking by externalmagnetic fields in parity invariant QED$_3$ and its relation to the inducedspin in parity non-invariant QED$_3$ is further elaborated. Finally othervacuum polarisation effects around flux tubes in different variants of QED, inthree and four dimensions are mentioned.
