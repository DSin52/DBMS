Ten dimensional type IIA and IIB theories with p-branes are compactified to8-dimensions. It is shown that resulting branes can be classified according tothe representations of $\bf {SL(3,Z) \times SL(2,Z)}$. These p-branes can alsobe obtained by compactification of M theory on three torus and variouswrappings of membrane and five brane of the eleven dimensional theory. It isargued that there is evidence for bound states of the branes in eightdimensions as is the case in the interpretation of $\bf {SL(2,Z)}$ family ofstring solutions obtained by Schwarz.
