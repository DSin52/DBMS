A charge-monopole theory is derived from simple and self-evident postulates.Charges and monopoles take an analogous theoretical structure. It is provedthat charges interact with free waves emitted from monopoles but not with thecorresponding velocity fields. Analogous relations hold for monopole equationsof motion. The system's equations of motion can be derived from a regularLagrangian function.
