Title: Boundary Effects in String Theory

Comments: Talk presented at the Strings '95 Conference, USC (March 1995).

Latex, 10 pagesSome of the properties of string theory defined on world-sheets withboundaries are reviewed. Particular emphasis is put on the possibility ofidentifying string configurations (\lq D-instantons' and \lq D-branes') thatgive rise to stringy non-perturbative effects.
