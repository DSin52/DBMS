The classic question of a nonabelian Yang-Mills analogue to electromagneticduality is here examined in a minimalist fashion at the strictly 4-dimensional,classical field and point charge level. A generalisation of the abelian Hodgestar duality is found which, though not yet known to give dual symmetry,reproduces analogues to many dual properties of the abelian theory. Forexample, there is a dual potential, but it is a 2-indexed tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$of the Freedman-Townsend type. Though not itself functioning as such,$T_{\mu\nu}$ gives rise to a dual parallel transport, $\tilde{A}_\mu$, for thephase of the wave function of the colour magnetic charge, this last being amonopole of the Yang-Mills field but a source of the dual field. The standardcolour (electric) charge itself is found to be a monopole of $\tilde{A}_\mu$.At the same time, the gauge symmetry is found doubled from say $SU(N)$ to$SU(N) \times SU(N)$. A novel feature is that all equations of motion,including the standard Yang-Mills and Wong equations, are here derived from a`universal' principle, namely the Wu-Yang (1976) criterion for monopoles, whereinteractions arise purely as a consequence of the topological definition of themonopole charge. The technique used is the loop space formulation of Polyakov(1980).
