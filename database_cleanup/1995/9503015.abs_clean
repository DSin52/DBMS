The method of differential regularization is applied to calculate explicitlythe one-loop effective potential of a bosonized Nambu--Jona-Lasinio modelconsisting of scalar and pseudoscalar fields. The regularization schemeindependent relation for the $\sigma$ mass sum rule is obtained. This methodcan be readily applied to extended NJL models with gauge fields.
