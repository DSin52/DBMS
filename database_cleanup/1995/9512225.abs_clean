As an illustration of the formalism of the master field we considergeneralised $QCD_2$. We show how Wilson Loop averages for an arbitrary contourcan be computed explicitly and with some ease. A generalised Hopf equation isshown to govern the behaviour of the eigenvalue density of Wilson loops. Thecollective field description of the theory is therefore deduced. Finally, thenon-trivial master gauge field and field strengths are obtained. These resultsdo not seem easily accessible with conventional means.
