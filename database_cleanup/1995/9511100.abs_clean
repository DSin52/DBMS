Title: Bosonization and Duality in Condensed Matter Systems

Comments: TeX, 14 pg

We show that abelian bosonization of 1+1 dimensional fermion systems can beinterpreted as duality transformation and, as a conseguence, it can begeneralized to arbitrary dimensions in terms of gauge forms of rank $d-1$,where $d$ is the dimension of the space. This permit to treat condensed mattersystems in $d>1$ as gauge theories. Furthermore we show that in the ``scaling"limit the bosonized action is quadratic in a wide class of condensed mattersystems.
