The properties of cosmic strings have been investigated in detail for theirimplications in early-universe cosmology. Although many variations of the basicstructure have been discovered, with implications for both the microscopic andmacroscopic properties of cosmic strings, the cylindrical symmetry of theshort-distance structure of the string is generally unaffected. In this paperwe describe some mechanisms leading to an asymmetric structure of the stringcore, giving the defects a quasi-two-dimensional character. We also begin toinvestigate the consequences of this internal structure for the microscopic andmacroscopic physics.
