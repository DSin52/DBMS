We study systematically the Lax description of the KdV hierarchy in terms of anoperator which is the geometrical recursion operator. We formulate the Laxequation for the $n$-th flow, construct the Hamiltonians which lead tocommuting flows. In this formulation, the recursion relation between theconserved quantities follows naturally. We give a simple and compact definitionof all the Hamiltonian structures of the theory which are related through apower law.
