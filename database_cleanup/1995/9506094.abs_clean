and $D=3$Authors: V. Berezovoj and A. Pashnev

Comments: LaTeX, 8 pages

The superfield formulation of two - dimensional $N=4$ Extended SupersymmetricQuantum Mechanics (SQM) is described. It is shown that corresponding classicalLagrangian describes the motion in the conformally flat metric with additionalpotential term. The Bose and Fermi sectors of two- and three-dimensional $N=4$SQM are analyzed. The structure of the quantum Hamiltonians is such, that theusual Shr\"{o}dinger equation in the flat space arises after some unitarytransformation, demonstrating the effect of transmutation of the couplingconstant and the energy of the initial model in some special cases.
