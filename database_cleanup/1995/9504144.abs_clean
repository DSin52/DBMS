Title: Topological Symmetries of Twisted N=2 Chiral Supergravity in Ashtekar

FormalismComments: 15 pages, Latex

In this paper a topological theory of gravity is studied on a four-manifoldusing the formalism of Capovilla {\sl et al}. We show that it is factequivalent to Anselmi and Fre's topological gravity using the topologicalsymmetries. Using this formalism gives us a new way to study topologicalgravity and the intersection theory of gravitational instantons if the (3+1)decomposition with respect to local coordinates is performed.
