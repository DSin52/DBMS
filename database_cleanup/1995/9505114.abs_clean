Following a remark advanced by Feynman,we study the connection between theform of the nonlinear vertices involving gauge particles and the Abelian gaugeinvariance of physical tree amplitudes. We show that this requirement, togetherwith some natural assumptions, fixes uniquely the structure of the Yang-Millstheory. However, the constraints imposed by the above property are notsufficient to single out the gauge theory of gravitation.
