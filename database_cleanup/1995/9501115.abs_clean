dimensional Field TheoriesAuthors: Wulf Boettger, Henning Wissowski and Hans A. Kastrup

Comments: 8 pages, no figures

The Hamilton--Jacobi formalism generalized to 2--dimensional field theoriesaccording to Lepage's canonical framework is applied to several covariant realscalar fields, e.g. massless and massive Klein--Gordon, Sine--Gordon, Liouvilleand $\phi^4$ theories. For simplicity we use the Hamilton--Jacobi equation ofDeDonder and Weyl. Unlike mechanics we have to impose certain integrabilityconditions on the velocity fields to guarantee the transversality relationsbetween Hamilton--Jacobi wave fronts and the corresponding families ofextremals embedded therein. B\"acklund Transformations play a crucial role insolving the resulting system of coupled nonlinear PDEs.
