Generalizing the Bogoliubov model of a weakly non-ideal Bose gas to massless$\lambda\varphi^4$ theory we show that spontaneous breaking of symmetry occursdue to condensation in a coherent vacuum % which is energetically favouredcompared to the perturbative one. and leads to a vacuum energy density which islower than that obtained by Coleman and Weinberg using the one-loop effectivepotential method. We discuss the alternative of a squeezed condensate and findthat for the massless $\lambda \varphi^4$ theory spontaneous symmetry breakingto a squeezed vacuum does not occur.
