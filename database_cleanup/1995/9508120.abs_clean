We consider 5D Kaluza-Klein type cosmological model with the fifth coordinatebeing a generalization of the invariant ``historical'' time $\tau $ of thecovariant theory of Horwitz and Piron. We distinguish between vacuum-,off-shell matter-, and on-shell matter-dominated eras as the solutions of thecorresponding 5D gravitational field equations, and build an inflationaryscenario according to which passage from the off-shell matter-dominated era tothe on-shell one occurs, probably as a phase transition. We study the effect ofthis phase transition on the expansion rate in both cases of local $O(4,1)$ and$O(3,2)$ invariance of the extended $(x^\mu ,\tau )$ manifold and show that itdoes not change in either case. The expansion of the model we consider is notadiabatic; the thermodynamic entropy is a growing function of cosmic time forthe closed universe, and can be a growing function of historical time for theopen and the flat universe. A complete solution of the 5D gravitational fieldequations is obtained for the on-shell matter-dominated universe. The open andthe closed universe are shown to tend asymptotically to the standard 4Dcosmological models, in contrast to the flat universe which does not have thecorresponding limit. Finally, possible cosmological implications are brieflydiscussed.
