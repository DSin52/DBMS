By carefully analyzing the relations between operator methods and thediscretized and continuum path integral formulations of quantum-mechanicalsystems, we have found the correct Feynman rules for one-dimensional pathintegrals in curved spacetime. Although the prescription how to deal with theproducts of distributions that appear in the computation of Feynman diagrams inconfiguration space is surprising, this prescription follows unambiguously fromthe discretized path integral. We check our results by an explicit two-loopcalculation.
