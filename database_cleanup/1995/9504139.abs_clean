The Kerr solution to axidilaton gravity is analyzed in theDebney--Kerr--Schild formalism. It is shown that the Kerr principal nullcongruence retains its property to be geodesic and shear free, however, theaxidilatonic Kerr solution is not algebraically special. A limiting form ofthis solution is considered near the ring-like Kerr singularity. This limitingsolution coincides with the field around a fundamental heterotic stringobtained by Sen.
