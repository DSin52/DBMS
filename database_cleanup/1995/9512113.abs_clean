The effective action for the local composite operator $\Phi^2(x)$ in thescalar quantum field theory with $\lambda\Phi^4$ interaction is obtained in theexpansion in two-particle-point-irreducible (2PPI) diagrams up to five-loops.The effective potential and 2-point Green's functions for elementary andcomposite fields are derived. The ground state energy as well as one- andtwo-particle excitations are calculated for space-time dimension $n=1$, whenthe theory is equivalent to the quantum mechanics of an anharmonic oscillator.The agreement with the exact spectrum of the oscillator is much better thanthat obtained within the perturbation theory.
