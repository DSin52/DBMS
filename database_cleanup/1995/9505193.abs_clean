We prove the renormalizability of quantum gravity near two dimensions. Thesuccessful strategy is to keep the volume preserving diffeomorphism as themanifest symmetry of the theory. The general covariance is recovered by furtherimposing the conformal invariance. The proof utilizes BRS formalism in parallelwith Yang-Mills theory. The crucial ingredient of the proof is the relationbetween the conformal anomaly and the $\beta$ functions.
