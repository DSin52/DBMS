In a recent paper, Duff and Rahmfeld argued that certain massive $N_R=1/2$states of the four-dimensional heterotic string correspond to extreme blackhole solutions. We provide further, dynamical, evidence for this identificationby comparing the scattering of these elementary string states with that of thecorresponding extreme black holes, in the limit of low velocities.
