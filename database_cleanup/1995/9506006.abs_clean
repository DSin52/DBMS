Comments: 3 pages, jytex; hep-th # change

Report in extended abstract form. Based on talk given at Strings '95, LosAngeles, CA. This is a summary of the findings initially presented inhep-th/9505080. Results of a step (the complete classification of freefermionic solutions to $N=1$ spacetime) in the search for stringythree-generation SO(10) SUSY-GUTs are reviewed.
