motion in $N=1, D=6$ supersymmetric gauge theoryAuthors: B.M.Zupnik

We consider the $SYM^1_6$ harmonic-superspace system of equations thatcontains superfield constraints and equations of motion for the simplestsix-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory. A special $A$-frame of theanalytic basis is introduced where a kinematic equation for the harmonicconnection $A^{\s--}$ can be solved . A dynamical equation in this frame isequivalent to the zero-curvature equation corresponding to the covariantconservation of analyticity. Using a simple harmonic gauge condition for thegauge group $SU(2)$ we derive the superfield equations that produce the general$SYM^1_6$ solution . An analogous approach for the analysis of integrabilityconditions for the $SYM^2_4$-theory and $SYM$-supergravity-matter systems inharmonic superspace is discussed briefly.
