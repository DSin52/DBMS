Title: Some approaches to 2+1-dimensional gravity coupled to point-particles

Comments: 24 pages Latex, 12 figures (uuencoded) Talk given at Kazan Summer

SchoolIn these notes we will review some approaches to 2+1 dimensional gravity andthe way it is coupled to point-particles. First we look into some exact staticand stationary solutions with and without cosmological constant. Next we studythe polygon approach invented by 't Hooft. The third section treats theChern-Simonons formulation of 2+1-gravity. In the last part we map the problemof finding the gravitational field around point-particles to theRiemann-Hilbert problem.
