Title: Topology and Inequivalent Quantizations of Abelian Sigma Model

Comments: 4 pages, Latex (proceedings of Second Pasific Winter School for

Theoretical Physics held at Sorak Mountain in Korea in January 1995)The abelian sigma model in (1+1) dimensions is a field theoretical model whichrespecting the topological aspect of the model. It is shown that the zero-modehas an infinite number of inequivalent quantizations. It is also shown thatwhen a central extension is introduced into the algebra, the winding operatorand the momenta operators satisfy anomalous commutators.
