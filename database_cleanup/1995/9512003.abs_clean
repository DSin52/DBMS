We show that the equations of motion defined over a specific field space arerealizable as operator conditions in the physical sector of a generalized Floertheory defined over that field space. The ghosts associated with such aconstruction are found not to be dynamical. This construction is applied togravity on a four dimensional manifold, $M$; whereupon, we obtain Einstein'sequations via surgery, along $M$, in a five-dimensional topological quantumfield theory.
