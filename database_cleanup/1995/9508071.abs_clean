Generically, string models with $N=1$ supersymmetry are not expected to havemoduli beyond perturbation theory; stringy non-perturbative effects as well aslow energy field-theoretic phenomena such as gluino condensation will lift anyflat directions. In this note, we describe models where some subspace of themoduli space survives non-perturbatively. Discrete $R$ symmetries forbid anyinherently stringy effects, and dynamical considerations control thefield-theoretic effects. The surviving subspace is a space of high symmetry;the system is attracted to this subspace by a potential which we compute.Models of this type may be useful for considerations of duality and raisetroubling cosmological questions about string theory. Our considerations alsosuggest a mechanism for fixing the expectation value of the dilaton.
