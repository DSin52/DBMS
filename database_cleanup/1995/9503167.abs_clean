Title: ``Th\'eorie de Liouville et gravitation quantique

couplage fort.''Paris)Comments: 108 pages, in french. PHD Thesis about Liouville Theory

The first chapters introduce briefly conformal theories, Moore and Seibergpolynomial equations and Gervais-Neveu quantization of Liouville theory. Thenext chapters present the original results of this thesis. First, the algebraof the chiral components is completely elucidated, both in the Bloch wave andin the Quantum Group basis. Then, in the strong coupling regime, the proof ofthe truncation theorem of Gervais to real weight operators for C = 7, 13, 19 iscompleted, especially including fractionnal spins. In this strong couplingregime, the new cosmological term yields a real string susceptibility equal tothe real part of the KPZ formula. And eventually the N-point functions of astrongly coupled topological model are obtained.
