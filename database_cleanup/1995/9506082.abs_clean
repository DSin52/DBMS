The theoretical foundation of the object moving faster than light in vacuum({\it tachyon}) is still missing or incomplete. Here we present the classicalfoundation of the relativistic dynamics including the tachyon. An anomaloussign-factor extracted from the transformation of ${ \sqrt{1-u^{2}/c^{2} } }$under the Lorentz transformation, which has been always missed in the usualformulation of the tachyon, has a crucial role in the dynamics of the tachyon.Due to this factor the mass of the tachyon transforms in the unusual wayalthough the energy and momentum, which are defined as the conserved quantitiesin all uniformly moving systems, transform in the usual way as in the case ofthe object moving slower than light ({\it bradyon}). We show that this resultcan be also obtained from the least action approach. On the other hand, we showthat the ambiguities for the description of the dynamics for the object movingwith the velocity of light ({\it luxon}) can be consistently removed only byintroducing a new dynamical variable. Furthermore, by using the fundamentaldefinition of the momentum and energy we show that the zero-point energy forany kind of the objects, {\it i.e.}, the tachyon, bradyon, and luxon, which hasbeen known as the undetermined constant, should satisfy some constraints forconsistency, and we note that this is essentially another novel relativisticeffect. Finally, we remark about the several unsolved problems.
