Journal-ref: Rev.Math.Phys. 8 (1996) 907-924

Within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory, we constructexplicitly localized morphisms of a Haag-Kastler net in 1+1-dimensionalMinkowski space showing abelian braid group statistics. Moreover, weinvestigate the scattering theory of the corresponding quantum fields.
