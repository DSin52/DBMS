Comments: 3 pages, latex, uuencoded postscript figures; talk given at 7th

Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General Relativity, Stanford University, July24-29, 1994We study the first-order phase transition in a model of scalar field with$O(3)$ symmetry coupled to gravity, and, in high temperature limit, discuss theexistence of new bubble solution with a global monopole at the center of thebubble.
