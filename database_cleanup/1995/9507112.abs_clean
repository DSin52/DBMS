We analyze in detail the possible breaking of spacetime supersymmetry underT-duality transformations. We find that when appropiate world-sheet effects aretaken into account apparent puzzles concerning supersymmetry in spacetime aresolved. We study T-duality in general heterotic $\sigma$-models analyzingpossible anomalies, and we find some modifications of Buscher's rules. We thenwork out a simple but representative example which contains most of thedifficulties. We also consider the issue of supersymmetry versus duality formarginal deformations of WZW models and present a mechanism that restoressupersymmetry dynamically in the effective theory.
