Title: The black hole information paradox

Comments: 15 pages (harvmac l mode)

A concise survey of the black hole information paradox and its current statusis given. A summary is also given of recent arguments against remnants. Theassumptions underlying remnants, namely unitarity and causality, would implythat Reissner Nordstrom black holes have infinite internal states. These can beargued to lead to an unacceptable infinite production rate of such black holesin background fields.
