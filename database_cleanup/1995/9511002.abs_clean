A general method is presented which allows one to determine from the localgauge invariant observables of a quantum field theory the underlying particleand symmetry structures appearing at the lower (ultraviolet) end of thespatio--temporal scale. Particles which are confined to small scales, i.e., donot appear in the physical spectrum, can be uncovered in this way withouttaking recourse to gauge fields or indefinite metric spaces. In this waynotions such as quark, gluon, colour symmetry and confinement acquire a new andintrinsic meaning which is stable under gauge or duality transformations. Themethod is illustrated by the example of the Schwinger model.
