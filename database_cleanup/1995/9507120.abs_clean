Title: One-Loop Quadratic Divergences of the Dual Non-Linear Sigma Model in

Four-Dimensional SpacetimeComments: 9 pages, LaTeX2e, no figures, uses axodraw package for Feynman

diagrams. Axodraw available via anonymous ftp,DVI version of preprint available via anonymous ftp or WWW;Following a review of the dual description of the non-linear sigma model weinvestigate the one-loop quadratic divergences. We use the covariant backgroundfield method for the general case and apply the results to the importantexample of $SU(2)$.
