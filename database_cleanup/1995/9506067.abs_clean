We study boundary bound states using the Bethe ansatz formalism for thefinite $XXZ$ $(\Delta>1)$ chain in a boundary magnetic field $h$. Boundarybound states are represented by the ``boundary strings'' similar to thosedescribed in the work of H.Saleur, S.Skorik. We find that for certain values of$h$ the ground state wave function contains boundary strings, and from thisinfer the existence of two ``critical'' fields in agreement with the results ofJimbo et al. An expression for the vacuum surface energy in the thermodynamiclimit is derived and found to be an analytic function of $h$. We argue thatboundary excitations appear only in pairs with ``bulk'' excitations or withboundary excitations at the other end of the chain. We mainly discuss the casewhere the magnetic fields at the left and the right boundaries areantiparallel, but we also comment on the case of the parallel fields. In theIsing ($\Delta=\infty$) and isotropic ($\Delta=1$) limits our results agreewith those previously known.
