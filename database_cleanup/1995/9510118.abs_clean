The spacetime singularities play a useful role in gravitational theories bydistinguishing physical solutions from non-physical ones. The problem, wequestion, we have analyzed the general problem of stability of the family ofthe static spherically symmetric solutions of the standard Einstein-Maxwellmodel coupled to an extra free massless scalar field. We have obtained theequations for the axial and polar perturbations. The stability against axialperturbations has been proven.
