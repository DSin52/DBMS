Schild's null (tensionless) strings are discussed in certain flat and curvedbackgrounds. We find closed, stationary, null strings as natural configurationsexisting on the horizons of spacetimes which possess such null hypersurfaces.Examples of these are obtained in Schwarzschild and Rindler spacetimes. Adynamic null string is also identified in Rindler spacetime. Furthermore, ageneral prescription (with explicit examples) is outlined by means of whichnull string configurations can be obtained in a large class of cosmologicalbackgrounds.
