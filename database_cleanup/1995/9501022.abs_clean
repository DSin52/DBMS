The infrared limit of $D=4,~~N=4$ Yang-Mills theory with compact gauge group$G$ compactified on a two-torus is governed by an effective superconformalfield theory. We conjecture that this is a certain orbifold involving themaximal torus of $G$. Yang-Mills $S$-duality makes predictions for allcorrelators of this effective conformal field theory. These predictions areshown to be implied by the standard $T$-duality of the conformal field theory.Consequently, Montonen-Olive duality between electric and magnetic statesreduces to the standard two-dimensional duality between momentum and windingstates.
