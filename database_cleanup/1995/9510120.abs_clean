Title: Quantum Mechanics Violating Effects to Masses of Nambu-Goldstone Bosons

A Lesson for MajoronAuthors: Y\={u}ichi Chikashige and Tadashi Kon

Comments: 10 pages Inproper words in the title, in the abstract and in the

contents are correctedWe study gravitational quantum mechanics violating (QMV) effects to masses ofNambu-Goldstone bosons, taking majoron as an example. We show a supersymmetricmajoron has either mass of O(keV) for the dimension five potential or smallermass for effective potentials with higher dimensions. We extend the Dashen'sformula for pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons to include possible effects of QMV.
