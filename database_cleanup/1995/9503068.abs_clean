In a recent paper \cite{[Good1]} Good postulated new rules of quantization,one of the major features of which is that the quantum evolution of the wavefunction is always given by ordinary differential equations. In this paper weanalyse the proposal in some detail and discuss its viability and itsrelationship with the standard quantum theory. As a byproduct, a simplederivation of the `mass spectrum' for the Klein-Gordon field is presented, butit is also shown that there is a complete additional spectrum of negative`masses'. Finally, two major reasons are presented against the viability offor the hydrogen atom. b) For field models, the standard quantum theory cannotbe recovered from this alternative description.
