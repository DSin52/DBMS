We study the system of two WZNW models coupled to each other via thecurrent-current interaction. The system is proven to possess the strong/weakcoupling duality symmetry. The strong coupling phase of this theory isdiscussed in detail. It is shown that in this phase the interacting WZNW modelsapproach non-trivial conformal points along the renormalization group flow. Therelation between the principal chiral model and interacting WZNW models isinvestigated.
