We study the mechanism for appearance of massless solitons in type II stringcompactifications. We find that by combining $T$-duality with strong/weakduality of type IIB in 10 dimensions enhanced gauge symmetries and masslesssolitonic hypermultiplets encountered in Calabi-Yau compactifications can bestudied perturbatively using D-strings (the strong/weak dual to type IIBstring) compactified on ``D-manifolds''. In particular the nearly masslesssolitonic states of the type IIB compactifications correspond to elementarystates of D-strings. As examples we consider the D-string description ofenhanced gauge symmetries for type IIA string compactification on ALE spaceswith $A_n$ singularities and type IIB on a class of singular Calabi-Yauthreefolds. The class we study includes as a special case the conifoldsingularity in which case the perturbative spectrum of the D-string includesthe expected massless hypermultiplet with degeneracy one.
