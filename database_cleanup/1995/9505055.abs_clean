ferromagnetic nearest neighbour two-dimensional lattice system with spinvariables taking values in -1,0,+1. We consider large but finite volume, smallfixed magnetic field h and chemical potential "lambda" in the limit of zerotemperature; we analyze the first excursion from the metastable -1configuration to the stable +1 configuration. We compute the asymptoticbehaviour of the transition time and describe the typical tube of trajectoriesduring the transition. We show that, unexpectedly, the mechanism of transitionchanges abruptly when the line h=2*lambda is crossed.
