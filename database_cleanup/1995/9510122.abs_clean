We study the propagation of string fields (metric $G_{\mu\nu}$, Mawxell gaugepotential $A_{\mu}$, dilaton $\Phi$, and tachyon $T$) in a two-dimensional (2D)charged black hole. It is shown that the tachyon is a propagating field bothinside and outside the black hole. This becomes infinitely blueshifted at theinner horizon. We confirm that the inner horizon is unstable, whereas the outerhorizon is stable.
