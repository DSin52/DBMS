We examine the possibility of a confinement-deconfinement phase transition atfinite temperature in both parity invariant and topologically massivethree-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. We review an argument showing thatthe Abelian version of the Polyakov loop operator is an order parameter forconfinement, even in the presence of dynamical electrons. We show that, in theparity invariant case, where the tree-level Coulomb potential is logarithmic,there is a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at a critical temperature($T_c=e^2/8\pi+{\cal O}(e^4/m)$, when the ratio of the electromagnetic couplingand the temperature to the electron mass is small). Above $T_c$ the electriccharge is not confined and the system is in a Debye plasma phase, whereas below$T_c$ the electric charges are confined by a logarithmic Coulomb potential,qualitatively described by the tree-level interaction. When there is atopological mass, no matter how small, in a strict sense the theory is notconfining at any temperature; the model exhibits a screening phase, analogousto that found in the Schwinger model and two-dimensional QCD with masslessadjoint matter. However, if the topological mass is much smaller than the otherdimensional parameters, there is a temperature for which the range of theCoulomb interaction changes from the inverse topological mass to the inverseelectron mass. We speculate that this is a vestige of the BKT transition of theparity-invariant system, separating regions with screening and deconfiningbehavior.
