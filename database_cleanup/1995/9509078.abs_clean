The covariant technique for calculating the heat kernel asymptotic expansionfor an elliptic differential second order operator is generalized to manifoldswith boundary. The first boundary coefficients of the asymptotic expansionwhich are proportional to $t^{1/2}$ and $t^{3/2}$ are calculated. Our resultscoincide with completely independent results of previous authors.
