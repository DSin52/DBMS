Using finite abelian automorphism groups of $K3$ we construct orbifoldcandidates for Type IIA-heterotic dual pairs with maximal supersymmetry in sixand lower dimensions. On the heterotic side, these results extend the series ofknown reduced rank theories with maximal supersymmetry. The corresponding TypeIIA theories generalize the Schwarz and Sen proposal for the dual of thesimplest of the reduced rank theories constructed as a novel Type IIA $\IZ_2$orbifold.
