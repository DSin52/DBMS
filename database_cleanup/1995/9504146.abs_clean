A topological gauge invariant lagrangian for Seiberg-Witten monopoleequations is constructed. The action is invariant under a huge class of gaugetransformations which after BRST fixing leads to the BRST invariant actionassociated to Seiberg-Witten monopole topological theory. The supersymmetrictransformation of the fields involved in the construction is obtained from thenilpotent BRST algebra.
