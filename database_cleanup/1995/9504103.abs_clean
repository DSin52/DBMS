Previous path integral treatments of Yang-Mills on a Riemann surfaceautomatically sum over principal fiber bundles of all possible topologicaltypes in computing quantum expectations. This paper extends the path integralformulation to treat separately each topological sector. The formulation issufficiently explicit to calculate Wilson line expectations exactly. Further,it suggests two new measures on the moduli space of flat connections, one ofwhich proves to agree with the small-volume limit of the Yang-Mills measure.\copyright {\em 1996 American Institute of Physics.}
