Background Field MethodAuthors: M. Chaichian and M. Hayashi

The evolution of QCD coupling constant at finite temperature is considered bymaking use of the finite temperature renormalization group equation up to theone-loop order in the background field method with the Feynman gauge and theimaginary time formalism. The results are compared with the ones obtained inthe literature. We point out, in particular, the origin of the discrepanciesbetween different calculations, such as the choice of gauge, the break-down ofLorentz invariance, imaginary versus real time formalism and the applicabilityof the Ward identities at finite temperature.
