Title: New algebraic equation determining anomalies

Comments: 9 pages, RevTeX

We derive a new algebraic relation which can be used to find various spinorloop anomalies. We show that this relation includes the Wess-Zumino consistencycondition. For an example, we consider the chiral anomaly. With this formalism,the consistent anomaly and the covariant anomaly are determined simultaneously.
