Title: The Energy-Momentum Tensor in Field Theory II

Comments: plain TeX with harvmac, 3 PS figures, 21 pages

In a previous paper, field theory in curved space was considered, and aformula that expresses the first order variation of correlation functions withrespect to the external metric was postulated. The formula is given as anintegral of the energy-momentum tensor over space, where the short distancesingularities of the product of the energy-momentum tensor and an arbitrarycomposite field must be subtracted, and finite counterterms must be added.These finite counterterms have been interpreted geometrically as a connectionfor the linear space of composite fields over theory space. In this paper wewill study a second order consistency condition for the variational formula anddetermine the torsion of the connection. A non-vanishing torsion results fromthe integrability of the variational formula, and it is related to the Bosesymmetry of the product of two energy-momentum tensors. The massive Ising modelon a curved two-dimensional surface is discussed as an example, and theshort-distance singularities of the product of two energy-momentum tensors arecalculated explicitly.
