Hooft consistency conditions for the external anomalies of the conserved Rcurrent contain no corrections beyond one loopJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D53 (1996) 4526-4537; Erratum-ibid. D59 (1999) 109903

We discuss duality in $N=1$ SUSY gauge theories in Seiberg's conformalwindow, $(3N_c/2)<N_f<3N_c$. The 't Hooft consistency conditions -- the basictool for establishing the infrared duality -- are considered taking intoaccount higher order $\alpha$ corrections. The conserved (anomaly free) $R$current is built to all orders in $\alpha$. Although this current contains allorders in $\alpha$ the 't Hooft consistency conditions for this current areshown to be one-loop. This observation thus justifies Seiberg's matchingprocedure. We also briefly discuss the inequivalence of the ``electric" and``magnetic" theories at short distances.
