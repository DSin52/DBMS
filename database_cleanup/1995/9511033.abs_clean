The ratio Z_1/Z_3 of vertex and wave-function renormalization factors, whichis universal (i.e., matter-independent), is shown to equal 1+u which gives theresidue of the scalar pole $\propto p_\mu p_\nu /p^2$ of 2-point function <D_\mu c D_\nu \bar c >. This relation is interesting since 1+u=0 has been knownto give a sufficient condition for color confinement. We also give an argumentthat, when 1+u=0 holds, it will be realized by the disappearance of themassless gauge boson pole and is related with the restoration of a certain``local gauge symmetry" as was discussed by Hata.
