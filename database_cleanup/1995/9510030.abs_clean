Title: A Superspace Formulation for the Master Equation

Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Nelson R. F. Braga

Comments: The constrained nature of standard BRST superfields and the

importance of using Alfaro and Damgaard's collective fields in the superspaceapproach to avoid undefined superfield derivatives was emphasized. To appearin Phys. Rev. D. Latex file, 20 pagesJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D54 (1996) 4080-4086

It is shown that the quantum master equation of the Field Antifieldquantization method at one loop order can be translated into the requirement ofa superfield structure for the action. The Pauli Villars regularization isimplemented in this BRST superspace and the case of anomalous gauge theories isinvestigated. The quantum action, including Wess Zumino terms, shows up as oneof the components of a superfield that includes the BRST anomalies in the othercomponent. The example of W2 quantum gravity is also discussed.
