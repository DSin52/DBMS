The sine-Gordon Y-systems and those of the minimal $M_{p,q}+\phi_{13}$ modelsare determined in a compact form and a correspondence between the rationalnumbers and a new infinite family of multi-parameter functional equations forthe Rogers dilogarithm is pointed out. The relation between the TBA-duality andthe massless RG fluxes in the minimal models recently conjectured is brieflydiscussed.
