We study the $O(n)$ loop model on the honeycomb lattice with open boundaryconditions. Reflection matrices for the underlying Izergin-Korepin $R$-matrixlead to three inequivalent sets of integrable boundary weights. One set, whichhas previously been considered, gives rise to the ordinary surface transition.The other two sets correspond respectively to the special surface transitionand the mixed ordinary-special transition. We analyse the Bethe ansatzequations derived for these integrable cases and obtain the surface energiestogether with the central charges and scaling dimensions characterizing thecorresponding phase transitions.
