We consider the metrics for cosmic strings and $p$-branes in spacetimedimension $N>4$, that is, we look for solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-Dilatongravity in $N$-dimensions with boost symmetry in the $p$-directions along thebrane. Focussing first in detail on the five dimensional uncharged cosmicstring we discuss the solution, which turns out to have a naked singularity onthe brane, as well as considering its Kaluza-Klein reduction. We show howsingularities may be avoided with particular core models. We then derive thegeneral uncharged $p$-brane solution in arbitrary dimension. Finally, weconsider an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton action, with arbitrary value of thedilaton coupling parameter, deriving the solutions for electrically andmagnetically charged branes, as well as a class of self-dual branes.
