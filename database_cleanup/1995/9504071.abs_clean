We prove that particle models whose action is given by the integrated $n$-thcurvature function over the world line possess $n+1$ gauge invariances. Ageometrical characterization of these symmetries is obtained via Frenetequations by rephrasing the $n$-th curvature model in $\reals^d$ in terms of astandard relativistic particle in $S^{d-n}$. We ``prove by example'' that thealgebra of these infinitesimal gauge invariances is nothing but $\W_{n+2}$,thus providing a geometrical picture of the $\W$-symmetry for these models. Asa spin-off of our approach we give a new global invariant for four-dimensionalcurves subject to a curvature constraint.
