Workshops on Elementary Particle Physics (Corfu, Greece, 3-24 September 1995)The generalized deformed oscillator schemes introduced as unified frameworksof various deformed oscillators are proved to be equivalent, their unifiedrepresentation leading to a correspondence between the deformed oscillator andthe N=2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY-QM) scheme. In addition, severalphysical systems (two identical particles in two dimensions, isotropicoscillator and Kepler system in a 2-dim curved space) and mathematicalstructures (quadratic algebra QH(3), finite W algebra $\bar {\rm W}_0$) areshown to possess the structure of a generalized deformed su(2) algebra, therepresentation theory of which is known. Furthermore, the generalized deformedparafermionic oscillator is identified with the algebra of several physicalsystems (isotropic oscillator and Kepler system in 2-dim curved space,Fokas--Lagerstrom, Smorodinsky--Winternitz and Holt potentials) andmathematical constructions (generalized deformed su(2) algebra, finite Walgebras $\bar {\rm W}_0$ and W$_3^{(2)}$). The fact that the Holt potential ischaracterized by the W$_3^{(2)}$ symmetry is obtained as a by-product.
