Authors: Ralf Kerschner

Comments: 22 pages, LateX

The existence of inequivalent representations in quantum field theory with{\it finitely} many degrees of freedom is shown. Their properties areexemplified and analysed for concrete and simple models. In particular therelations to Bogoliubov--Valatin quasi-particles, to thermo field dynamics, andto $q$--deformed quantum theories are put foreward. The thermal properties ofthe non-trivial vacuum are given and it is shown that the thermodynamicequilibrium state is uniquely obtained by an irreversible vacuum dynamics.superconductivity. An exact solution in order $O(N^{-1})$ for the full particlenumber conserving BCS--Hamiltonian with particle number symmetric ground stateis given.
