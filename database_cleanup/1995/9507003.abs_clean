In this letter we report on the computation of instanton-dominatedcorrelation functions in supersymmetric YM theories on ALE spaces. Followingthe approach of Kronheimer and Nakajima, we explicitly construct the self-dualconnection on ALE spaces necessary to perform such computations. We restrictour attention to the simplest case of an $SU(2)$ connection with lowest Chernclass on the Eguchi-Hanson gravitational background.
