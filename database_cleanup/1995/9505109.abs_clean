Title: Invariant Effective Actions and Cohomology

Comments: 15 pages, Plain TeX, no figures

We review the correspondence between effective actions resulting fromnon-invariant Lagrangian densities, for Goldstone bosons arising fromspontaneous breakdown of a symmetry group G to a subgroup H, and non-trivialgenerators of the de Rham cohomology of G/H. We summarize the construction ofcohomology generators in terms of symmetric tensors with certain invariance andvanishing properties with respect to G and H. The resulting actions in fourdimensions arise either from products of generators of lower degree such as theGoldstone-Wilczek current, or are of the Wess-Zumino-Witten type. Actions inthree dimensions arise as Chern-Simons terms evaluated on composite gaugefields and may induce fractional spin on solitons. {Contribution to theProceedings of STRINGS 95, held at University of Southern California, March 13
