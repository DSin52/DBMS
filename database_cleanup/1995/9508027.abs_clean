Title: Non-Hermitian quantum canonical variables and the generalized ladder

operatorsComments: 18 pages, plain LaTeX

Quantum canonical transformations of the second kind and the non-Hermitianrealizations of the basic canonical commutation relations are investigated witha special interest in the generalization of the conventional ladder operators.The operator ordering problem is shown to be resolved when the non-Hermitianrealizations for the canonical variables which can not be measuredsimultaneously with the energy are chosen for the canonical quantizations.Another merit of the non-Hermitian representations is that it naturally allowsus to introduce the generalized ladder operators with which one can solveeigenvalue problems quite neatly.
