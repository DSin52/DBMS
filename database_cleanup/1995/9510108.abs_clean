A group theory justification of one dimensional fractional supersymmetry isproposed using an analogue of a coset space, just like the one introduced in$1D$ supersymmetry. This theory is then gauged to obtain a local fractionalsupersymmetry {\it i.e.} a fractional supergravity which is then quantized {\it\`a la Dirac} to obtain an equation of motion for a particle which is in arepresentation of the braid group and should describe alternative statistics. Aformulation invariant under general reparametrization is given, by means of acurved fractional superline.
