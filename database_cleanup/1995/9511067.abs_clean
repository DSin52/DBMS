We find exact charged black hole solutions of a string effective action thatis invariant under S-duality transformations. These black hole solutions havethe same causal structure as the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) solutions. They reduceto the RN solutions for self-dual configurations of the dilaton and to theGarfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) solution in the weak (or strong) couplingregime. Using the purely magnetic solutions of the S-duality model we alsogenerate dyonic black hole solutions of the GHS model, which have the causalstructure of the RN solutions.
