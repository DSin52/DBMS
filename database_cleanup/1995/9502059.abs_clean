In this paper we investigate the canonical quantization of a non-Abeliantopologically massive Chern-Simons theory in which the gauge fields areminimally coupled to a multiplet of scalar fields in such a way that the gaugesymmetry is spontaneously broken. Such a model produces the Chern-Simons-Higgsmechanism in which the gauge excitations acquire mass both from theChern-Simons term and from the Higgs-Kibble effect. The symmetry breaking ischosen to be only partially broken, in such a way that in the broken vacuumthere remains a residual non-Abelian symmetry. We develop the canonicaloperator structure of this theory in the broken vacuum, with particularemphasis on the particle-content of the fields involved in theChern-Simons-Higgs mechanism. We construct the Fock space and express thedynamical generators in terms of creation and annihilation operator modes. Thecanonical apparatus is used to obtain the propagators for this theory, and weuse the Poincar\'e generators to demonstrate the effect of Lorentz boosts onthe particle states.
