We address the problem of finite-size anyons, i.e., composites of charges andfinite radius magnetic flux tubes. Making perturbative calculations in thisproblem meets certain difficulties reminiscent of those in the problem ofpointlike anyons. We show how to circumvent these difficulties for anyons ofarbitrary spin. The case of spin 1/2 is special because it allows for a directapplication of perturbation theory, while for any other spin, a redefinition ofthe wave function is necessary. We apply the perturbative algorithm to theN-body problem, derive the first-order equation of state and discuss someexamples.
