We study the first-order formalism of pure four-dimensional ${\rm SU}(2)$Yang--Mills theory with theta-term. We describe the Green functions associatedto electric and magnetic flux operators \`a la 't~Hooft by means ofgauge-invariant non-local operators. These Green functions are related toWitten's invariants of four-manifolds.
