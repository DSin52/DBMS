Under special conditions (Meissner-effect levitation in a high frequencymagnetic field and rapid rotation) a disk of high-$T_c$ superconductingmaterial has recently been found to produce a weak shielding of thegravitational field. We show that this phenomenon has no explanation in thestandard gravity theories, except possibly in the non-perturbative Euclideanquantum theory.
