Basic quantities related to 2-D gravity, such as Polyakov extrinsic action,Nambu-Goto action, geometrical action, and Euler characteristic are studiedusing generalized Weierstrass-Enneper (GWE) inducing of surfaces. Connection ofthe GWE inducing with conformal immersion is made and varius aspects of thetheory are shown to be invariant under the modified Veselov-Novikov hierarchyof flows. The geometry of certain surfaces is shown to be connected with thedynamics of infinite and finite dimensional integrable systems. Connections toLiouville-Beltrami gravity are indicated.
