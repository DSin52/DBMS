We present the hyper-elliptic curve describing the moduli space of the N=2supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the $G_2$ gauge group. The exactmonodromies and the dyon spectrum of the theory are determined. It is verifiedthat the recently proposed solitonic equation is also satisfied by oursolution.
