We clarify the role played by BPS states in the calculation of thresholdcorrections of D=4, N=2 heterotic string compactifications. We evaluate thesecorrections for some classes of compactifications and show that they are sumsof logarithmic functions over the positive roots of generalized Kac-Moodyalgebras. Moreover, a certain limit of the formulae suggests a reformulation ofheterotic string in terms of a gauge theory based on hyperbolic algebras suchas $E_{10}$. We define a generalized Kac-Moody Lie superalgebra associated tothe BPS states. Finally we discuss the relation of our results with stringduality.
