Title: Local Operators in Massive Quantum Field Theories

Comments: 6 pages, latex

Contribution to the proceedings of Schladming 1995. A review of the formfactor approach and its utilisation to determine the space of local operatorsof integrable massive quantum theories is given. A few applications arediscussed.
