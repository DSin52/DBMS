We discuss the structure of the vacua in $O(2)$ topologically massive gaugetheory on a torus. Since $O(2)$ has two connected components, there are fourclassical vacua. The different vacua impose different boundary conditions onthe gauge potentials. We also discuss the non-perturbative transitions betweenthe vacua induced by vortices of the theory.
