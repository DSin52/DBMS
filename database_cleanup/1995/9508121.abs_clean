Title: On Relativistic Bose-Einstein Condensation

Authors: L. Burakovsky, L.P. Horwitz and W.C. Schieve

We discuss the properties of an ideal relativistic gas of events possessingBose-Einstein statistics. We find that the mass spectrum of such a system isbounded by $\mu \leq m\leq 2M/\mu _K,$ where $\mu $ is the usual chemicalpotential, $M$ is an intrinsic dimensional scale parameter for the motion of anevent in space-time, and $\mu _K$ is an additional mass potential of theensemble. For the system including both particles and antiparticles, withnonzero chemical potential $\mu ,$ the mass spectrum is shown to be bounded by$|\mu |\leq m\leq 2M/\mu _K,$ and a special type of high-temperatureBose-Einstein condensation can occur. We study this Bose-Einstein condensation,and show that it corresponds to a phase transition from the sector ofcontinuous relativistic mass distributions to a sector in which the boson massdistribution becomes sharp at a definite mass $M/\mu _K.$ This phenomenonprovides a mechanism for the mass distribution of the particles to be sharp atsome definite value.
