We discuss minisuperspace aspects a non empty Robertson-Walker universecontaining scalar matter field. The requirement that the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW)operator be self adjoint is a key ingredient in constructing the physicalHilbert space and has non-trivial cosmological implications since it is relatedwith the problem of time in quantum cosmology. Namely, if time is parametrizedby matter fields we find two types of domains for the self adjoint WDWtype) wave functions and is parametrized by two new parameters, whereas thedomain of a self adjoint WDW operator acting on tunneling (Vilenkin type) wavefunctions is a {\em single} ray. On the other hand, if time is parametrized bythe scale factor both types of wave functions give rise to non trivial domainsfor the self adjoint WDW operators, and no new parameters appear in them.
