To appear in Journal of Physics AIn a space of $d=15 $ Grassmann coordinates, two types of generators of theLorentz transformations, one of spinorial and the other of vectorial character,both linear operators in Grassmann space, forming the group $ SO(1,14) $ whichcontains as subgroups $ SO(1,4) $ and $ SO(10) $ ${\supset SU(3)} { \timesSU(2)} { \times U(1)} $, define the fundamental and the adjoint representationsof the group, respectively. The eigenvalues of the commuting operators can beidentified with spins of fermionic and bosonic fields $ (SO(1,4)) $, as well aswith their Yang-Mills charges $ (SU(3)$, $ SU(2)$, $ U(1)) $, offering theunification of not only all Yang - Mills charges but of all the internaldegrees of freedom of fermionic and bosonic fields - Yang - Mills charges andspins - and accordingly of all interactions - gauge fields and gravity. Thetheory suggests that elementary particles are either in the "spinorial"representations with respect to spins and all charges, or they are in the"vectorial" representations with respect to spins and all charges, which indeedis the case with the quarks, the leptons and the gauge bosons.The algebras of the two kinds of generators of Lorentz transformations inGrassmann space were studied and the representations are commented on.
