Title: Nontrivial, Asymptotically Non-free Gauge Theories and Dynamical

Unification of CouplingsJournal-ref: Phys.Rev. D52 (1995) 6475-6480

An evidence for nontriviality of asymptotically non-free (ANF) Yang-Millstheories is found on the basis of optimized perturbation theory. It is arguedthat these theories with matter couplings can be made nontrivial by means ofthe reduction of couplings, leading to the idea of dynamical unification ofcouplings (DUC) The second-order reduction of couplings in the ANF$SU(3)$-gauged Higgs-Yukawa theory, which is assumed to be nontrivial here, iscarried out to motivate independent investigations on its nontriviality andDUC.
