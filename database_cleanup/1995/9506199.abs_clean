Working directly on affine Lie groups, we construct several new formulationsof the WZW model. In one formulation WZW is expressed as a one-dimensionalmechanical system whose variables are coordinates on the affine Lie group. Whenwritten in terms of the affine group element, this formulation exhibits atwo-dimensional WZW term. In another formulation WZW is written as atwo-dimensional field theory, with a three-dimensional WZW term, whose fieldsare coordinates on the affine group. On the basis of these equivalentformulations, we develop a translation dictionary in which the new formulationson the affine Lie group are understood as mode formulations of the conventionalWZW formulation on the Lie group. Using this dictionary, we also express WZW asa three-dimensional field theory on the Lie group with a four-dimensional WZWterm.
