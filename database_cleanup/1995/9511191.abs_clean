In this work we study the zero-charge sector of massive two-dimensionalQuantum Chromodynamics in the decoupled formulation. We find that some generalfeatures of the massless theory, concerning the constraints and the right- andleft-moving character of the corresponding BRST currents, survive in themassive case. The implications for the integrability properties previouslyvalid in the massless case, and the structure of the Hilbert space arediscussed.
