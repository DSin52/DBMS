Title: BRS Cohomology in Topological String Theory and Integrable Systems

Comments: 17 pages, latex, no figures, Talk presented at International

symposium on BRS symmetry, RIMS, Kyoto, September 18-22, 1995In cohomological field theory we can obtain topological invariants ascorrelation functions of BRS cohomology classes. A proper understanding of BRScohomology which gives non-trivial results requires the equivariant cohomologytheory. Both topological Yang-Mills theory and topological string theory aretypical examples of this fact. After reviewing the role of the equivariantcohomology in topological Yang-Mills theory, we show in purely algebraicframework how the $U(1)$ equivariant cohomology in topological string theorygives the gravitational descendants. The free energy gives a generatingfunction of topological correlation functions and leads us to consider adeformation family of cohomological field theories. In topological strings sucha family is controlled by the theory of integrable system. This is most easilyseen in the Landau-Ginzburg approach by looking at the contact terminteractions between topological observables.
