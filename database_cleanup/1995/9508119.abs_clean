Title: Covariant Thermodynamics and ``Realistic'' Friedmann Model

Authors: L. Burakovsky and L.P. Horwitz

We discuss a cosmological Friedmann model modified by inclusion of off-shellmatter which has an equation of state $p,\rho \propto T^5,$ $p=1/4\rho .$ Suchmatter is shown to have energy density comparable with that of non-interactingradiation at temperatures of the order of the Hagedorn temperature, $\sim10^{12}$ K, indicating the possibility of a phase transition. It is argued thatthe $T^5$-phase, or an admixture, lies below the high-temperature $T^4$-phase.
