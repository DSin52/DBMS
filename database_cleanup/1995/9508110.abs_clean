of ``Physique et Combinatiore'' held at CIRM Luminy March 27-31, 1995We present generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identities which relate the fermi andbose forms of all the characters of the superconformal model $SM(2,4\nu).$ Inparticular we show that to each bosonic form of the character there is aninfinite family of distinct fermionic $q-$ series representations.
