A construction of conservation laws for chiral models (generalizedsigma-models on a two-dimensional space-time continuum using differential formsis extended in such a way that it also comprises corresponding discreteversions. This is achieved via a deformation of the ordinary differentialcalculus. In particular, the nonlinear Toda lattice results in this way fromthe linear (continuum) wave equation. The method is applied to several furtherexamples. We also construct Lax pairs and B\"acklund transformations for theclass of models considered in this work.
