We consider a class of 2 dimensional Toda equations on discrete space-time.It has arisen as functional relations in commuting family of transfer matricesin solvable lattice models associated with any classical simple Lie algebra$X_r$. For $X_r = B_r, C_r$ and $D_r$, we present the solution in terms ofPfaffians and determinants. They may be viewed as Yangian analogues of theclassical Jacobi-Trudi formula on Schur functions.
