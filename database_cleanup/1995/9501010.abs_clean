We examine the relativistic Nambu-Goto model with Gauss-Bonnet boundary termadded to the action integral. The system is analysed using an invariantrepresentation of dynamical string degrees of freedom by complex Liouvillefields. The solutions of classical equations of motion for open strings aredescribed.
