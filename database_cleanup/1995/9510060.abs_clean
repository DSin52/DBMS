In this paper we consider 2+1-dimensional gravity coupled to Npoint-particles. We introduce a gauge in which the $z$- and$\bar{z}$-components of the dreibein field become holomorphic andanti-holomorphic respectively. As a result we can restrict ourselves to theequivalent to solving the Riemann-Hilbert problem for the group $SO(2,1)$. Wegive the explicit solution for 2 particles in terms of hypergeometricfunctions. In the N-particle case we give a representation in terms ofconformal field theory. The dreibeins are expressed as correlators of 2 freefermion fields and twistoperators at the position of the particles.
