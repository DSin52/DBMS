We construct a 1+1 dimensional superstring-bit model for D=3 Type IIBsuperstring. This low dimension model escapes the problems encountered innoninteracting polymers of bits, the exactly soluble linear superpotentialdescribing bit interactions is in a large universality class of superpotentialswhich includes ones bounded at spatial infinity; (3) The latter are used toconstruct a superstring-bit model with the clustering properties needed todefine an $S$-matrix for closed polymers of superstring-bits.
