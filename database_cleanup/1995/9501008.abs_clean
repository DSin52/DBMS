Title: On Abelian Bosonization of Free Fermi Fields in Three Space Dimensions.

Comments: Based on a talk given by C. Sommerfield at Gursey Memorial Conference

I, Bogazici Univerisity, Istanbul, Turkey, June 1994, 7 pages, plain TeX.One of the methods used to extend two-dimensional bosonization to fourspace-time dimensions involves a transformation to new spatial variables sothat only one of them appears kinematically. The problem is then reduced to anAbelian version of two-dimensional bosonization with extra ``internal''coordinates. On a formal level, putting these internal coordinates on a finitelattice seems to provide a well-defined prescription for calculatingcorrelation functions. However, in the infinite-lattice or continuum limits,certain difficulties appear that require very delicate specification of all ofthe many limiting procedures involved in the construction.
