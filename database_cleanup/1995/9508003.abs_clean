Consistent Yang--Mills anomalies $\int\om_{2n-k}^{k-1}$ ($n\in\N$, $ k=1,2,\ldots ,2n$) as described collectively by Zumino's descent equations$\delta\om_{2n-k}^{k-1}+\dd\om_{2n-k-1}^{k}=0$ starting with the Cherncharacter $Ch_{2n}=\dd\om_{2n-1}^{0}$ of a principal $\SU(N)$ bundle over a$2n$ dimensional manifold are considered (i.e.\ $\int\om_{2n-k}^{k-1}$ are theChern--Simons terms ($k=1$), axial anomalies ($k=2$), Schwinger terms ($k=3$)etc.\ in $(2n-k)$ dimensions). A generalization in the spirit of Connes'noncommutative geometry using a minimum of data is found. For an arbitrarygraded differential algebra $\CC=\bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty \CC^{(k)}$ with\CC^{(0)}}_{\mbox{{\small $(k-1)$ times}}} \times \CC^{(1)}\to \CC^{(2n-k)}$are constructed which are connected by generalized descent equations$\delta\om_{2n-k}^{k-1}+\dd\om_{2n-k-1}^{k}=(\cdots)$. Here $Ch_{2n}= (F_A)^n$where $F_A=\dd(A)+A^2$ for $A\in\CC^{(1)}$, and $(\cdots)$ is not zero but asum of graded commutators which vanish under integrations (traces). The problemof constructing Yang--Mills anomalies on a given graded differential algebra isthereby reduced to finding an interesting integration $\int$ on it. Examplesfor graded differential algebras with such integrations are given and therebynoncommutative generalizations of Yang--Mills anomalies are found.
