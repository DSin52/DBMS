We study a topological obstruction of a very stringy nature concerned withdeforming the target space of an $N=2$ non-linear \sm. This target space has asingularity which may be smoothed away according to the conventional rules ofgeometry but when one studies the associated conformal field theory one seesthat such a deformation is not possible without a discontinuous change in someof the correlation functions. This obstruction appears to come from torsion inthe homology of the target space (which is seen by deforming the theory by anirrelevant operator). We discuss the link between this phenomenon and orbifoldswith discrete torsion as studied by Vafa and Witten.
