Title: Notes on (0,2) Superconformal Field Theories

Comments: 30 pages. Uses harvmac.tex, epsf.tex and AMS fonts

In these lecture notes, I review the ``linear sigma model" approach to (0,2)string vacua. My aim is to provide the reader with a toolkit for studying avery broad class of (0,2) superconformal field theories with the requisiteproperties to be candidate string vacua. These lectures were delivered at the1994 Trieste Summer School.
