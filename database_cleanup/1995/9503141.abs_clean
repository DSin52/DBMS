We consider those two-dimensional rational conformal field theories (RCFTs)whose chiral algebras, when maximally extended, are isomorphic to the currentalgebra formed from some affine non-twisted Kac--Moody algebra at fixed level.In this case the partition function is specified by an automorphism of thefusion ring and corresponding symmetry of the Kac--Peterson modular matrices.We classify all such partition functions when the underlying finite-dimensionalLie algebra is simple. This gives all possible spectra for this class of RCFTs.While accomplishing this, we also find the primary fields with second smallestquantum dimension.
