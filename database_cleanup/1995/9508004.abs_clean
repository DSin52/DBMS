Title: Quantized Temperatures Spectra in Curved Spacetimes

We consider the thermal properties of a scalar field theory on curvedspacetimes. In particular, we argue for the existence in the de Sitter, Kruskaland Rindler manifolds of a discrete spectrum of allowed temperatures (the oddmultiples of a fundamental one). For each temperature we give an explicitconstruction of the relative two point function in terms of the lowesttemperature one. These results are actually valid for a wider class of staticmetrics with bifurcate Killing horizons, originally studied by Sewell. Somecomments on the interpretation of our results are given.
