Title: Quantum gravity, the Planck lattice and the Standard Model

Authors: Giuliano Preparata and She-Sheng Xue

Comments: Invited Talk at the ``VII Marcel Grossman Meeting on General

Relativity'' - Stanford, July 1994. 14 pages, latex, five figures, which willbe available upon request.A possible ground state of Quantum Gravity is Wheeler's ``space-time foam'',which can be modeled as a ``Planck-lattice'', a space-time cubic lattice oflattice constant $a_P\simeq 10^{33}$cm, the Planck length. I analyse thestructure of the Standard Model defined on the Planck Lattice, in the light ofthe ``no-go'' theorem of Nielsen and Ninomiya, which requires an extension ofthe continuum model through Nambu-Jona Lasinio terms, quadrilinear in theFermi-fields. As a result, a theory of masses (of both fermions and gaugebosons) is seen to emerge that, without Higgs excitations, agrees well withobservations.
