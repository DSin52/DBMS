Title: On Some Integrable Generalisations of the Continuous Toda System

Comments: 12 pages, no figures, LaTeX file

In the present paper we obtain some integrable generalisations of thecontinuous Toda system generated by a flat connection form taking values inhigher grading subspaces of the algebra of the area--preserving diffeomorphismof the torus $T^2$, and construct their general solutions. The gradingcondition which we use here, imposed on the connection, can be realised interms of some holomorphic distributions on the corresponding homogeneousspaces.
