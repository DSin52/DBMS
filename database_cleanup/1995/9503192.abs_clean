We discuss the Chern-Simons theory in three-dimensional curved space-time inthe vielbein formalism. Due to the additional presence of the local Lorentzsymmetry, beside the diffeomorphisms, we will include a local gravitationalsupersymmetry (superdiffeomorphisms and super-Lorentz transformations), whichallows us to show the perturbative finiteness at all orders.
