207-209The effective Lagrangian of arbitrary varying in space electromagnetic fieldin a dense medium is derived. It has been used for investigation of interactionbetween charged fermions in the medium. It is shown the possibility for theformation of metastable electron bound states in the medium when externalmagnetic field is applied.
