We give explicit expressions for the q-multinomial generalizations of theq-binomials and Andrews' and Baxter's q-trinomials. We show that theconfiguration sums for the generalized RSOS models in regime III studied byDate et al. can be expressed in terms of these multinomials. This generalizesthe work of ABF and AB where configuration sums of statistical mechanicalmodels have been expressed in terms of binomial and trinomial coefficients.These RSOS configuration sums yield the branching functions for the$\widehat{su}(2)_{M}\times \widehat{su}(2)_{N}/\widehat{su}(2)_{M+N}$ cosetmodels. The representation in terms of multinomials gives Rocha-Caridi likeformulas whereas the representation of Date et al. gives a double sumrepresentation for the branching functions.
