We explicitly construct the adjoint operator of coboundary operator andobtain the Hodge decomposition theorem and the Poincar\'e duality for the Liealgebra cohomology of the infinite-dimensional gauge transformation group. Weshow that the adjoint of the coboundary operator can be identified with theBRST adjoint generator $Q^{\dagger}$ for the Lie algebra cohomology induced byBRST generator $Q$. We also point out an interesting duality relation -Poincar\'e duality - with respect to gauge anomalies and Wess-Zumino-Wittentopological terms. We consider the consistent embedding of the BRST adjointgenerator $Q^{\dagger}$ into the relativistic phase space and identify thenoncovariant symmetry recently discovered in QED with the BRST adjoint N\"othercharge $Q^{\dagger}$.
