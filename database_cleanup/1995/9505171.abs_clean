We study in detail gaugino condensation in globally and locallysupersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We focus on models for which gauge-neutralmatter couples to the gauge bosons only through nonminimal gauge kinetic terms,for the cases of one and several condensing gauge groups. Using only symmetryarguments, the low-energy expansion, and general properties of supersymmetry,we compute the low energy Wilson action, as well as the (2PI) effective actionfor the composite {\it classical} superfield $U\equiv\langle \Tr\WW \rangle$,with $W_\alpha$ the supersymmetric gauge field strength. The 2PI effectiveaction provides a firmer foundation for the approach of Veneziano andYankielowicz, who treated the composite superfield, $U$, as a quantum degree offreedom. We show how to rederive the Wilson action by minimizing the 2PI actionwith respect to $U$. We determine, in both formulations and for global andlocal supersymmetry, the effective superpotential, $W$, the non-perturbativecontributions to the low-energy K\"ahler potential $K$, and the leading highersupercovariant derivative terms in an expansion in inverse powers of thecondensation scale. As an application of our results we include the stringmoduli dependence of the super- and K\"ahler potentials for simple orbifoldmodels.
