Title: Operator algebra of the 4D W_3 string

Comments: 15 pages; uses macros tables.tex and amssym.def (version 2.1 or

later)The noncritical $4D$ $\cW_3$ string is a model of $\cW_3$ gravity coupled totwo free scalar fields. In this paper we discuss its BRST quantization indirect analogy with that of the $2D$ (Virasoro) string. The physical operatorsform a BV-algebra. We model this BV-algebra on that of the polyderivations of acommutative ring on six variables with a quadratic constraint, or,equivalently, on the BV-algebra of (polynomial) polyvector fields on the baseaffine space of $SL(3,\CC)$.
