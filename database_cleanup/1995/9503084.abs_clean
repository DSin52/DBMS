We find U(1)_{E} \times U(1)_{M} non-extremal black hole solutions of6-dimensional Kaluza-Klein supergravity theories. Extremal solutions were foundby Cveti\v{c} and Youm\cite{C-Y}. Multi black hole solutions are alsopresented. After electro-magnetic duality transformation is performed, thesemulti black hole solutions are mapped into the the exact solutions found byHorowitz and Tseytlin\cite{H-T} in 5-dimensional string theory compactifiedinto 4-dimensions. The massless fields of this theory can be embedded into theheterotic string theory compactified on a 6-torus. Rotating black holesolutions can be read off those of the heterotic string theory found bySen\cite{Sen3}.
