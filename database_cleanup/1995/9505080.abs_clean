Consistent heterotic free fermionic string models are classified in terms oftheir number of spacetime supersymmetries, N. For each of the six distinctchoices of gravitino sector, we determine what number of supersymmetries cansurvive additional GSO projections. We prove by exhaustive search that onlythree of the six can yield N = 1, in addition to the N = 4, 2, or 0 that fiveof the six can yield. One choice of gravitino sector can only produce N = 4 or0. Relatedly, we find that only Z_2, Z_4, and Z_8 twists of the internalfermions with worldsheet supersymmetry are consistent with N=1 in freefermionic models. Any other twists obviate N=1.
