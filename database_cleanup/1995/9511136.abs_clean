We propose a possible internal structure for a Schwarzschild black holeresulting from the creation of multiple de Sitter universes with lightlikeboundaries when the curvature reaches Planckian values. The intersection of theboundaries is studied and a scenario leading to disconnected de Sitteruniverses is proposed. The application to the information loss problem is thendiscussed.
