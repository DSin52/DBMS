from suganuma@miho.rcnp.osaka-u.ac.jp )Correlation between instantons and QCD-monopoles is studied in theabelian-gauge-fixed QCD. From a simple topological consideration, instantonsare expected to appear only around the QCD-monopole trajectory in theabelian-dominating system. The QCD-monopole in the multi-instanton solution isstudied in the Polyakov-like gauge, where $A_4(x)$ is diagonalized. The worldline of the QCD-monopole is found to be penetrate the center of each instanton.For the single-instanton solution, the QCD-monopole trajectory becomes a simplestraight line. On the other hand, in the multi-instanton system, theQCD-monopole trajectory often has complicated topology including a loop or afolded structure, and is unstable against a small fluctuation of the locationand the size of instantons. We also study the thermal instanton system in thePolyakov-like gauge. At the high-temperature limit, the monopole trajectorybecomes straight lines in the temporal direction. The topology of theQCD-monopole trajectory is drastically changed at a high temperature.
