The Poisson bracket algebra corresponding to the second Hamiltonian structureof a large class of generalized KdV and mKdV integrable hierarchies iscarefully analysed. These algebras are known to have conformal properties, andtheir relation to $\cal W$-algebras has been previously investigated in someparticular cases. The class of equations that is considered includespractically all the generalizations of the Drinfel'd-Sokolov hierarchiesconstructed in the literature. In particular, it has been recently shown thatit includes matrix generalizations of the Gelfand-Dickey and the constrained KPhierarchies. Therefore, our results provide a unified description of therelation between the Hamiltonian structure of soliton equations and $\calW$-algebras, and it comprises almost all the results formerly obtained by otherauthors. The main result of this paper is an explicit general equation showingthat the second Poisson bracket algebra is a deformation of the Dirac bracketalgebra corresponding to the $\cal W$-algebras obtained through Hamiltonianreduction.
