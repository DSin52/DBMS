In this paper we consider affine Toda systems defined on the half-plane andstudy the issue of integrability, i.e. the construction of higher-spinconserved currents in the presence of a boundary perturbation. First at theclassical level we formulate the problem within a Lax pair approach whichallows to determine the general structure of the boundary perturbationcompatible with integrability. Then we analyze the situation at the quantumlevel and compute corrections to the classical conservation laws in specificexamples. We find that, except for the sinh-Gordon model, the existence ofquantum conserved currents requires a finite renormalization of the boundarypotential.
