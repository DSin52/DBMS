For any given algebra of local observables in relativistic quantum fieldtheory there exists an associated scaling algebra which permits one tointroduce renormalization group transformations and to construct the scaling(short distance) limit of the theory. On the basis of this result it isdiscussed how the phase space properties of a theory determine the structure ofits scaling limit. Bounds on the number of local degrees of freedom appearingin the scaling limit are given which allow one to distinguish between theorieswith classical and quantum scaling limits. The results can also be used toestablish physically significant algebraic properties of the scaling limittheories, such as the split property.
