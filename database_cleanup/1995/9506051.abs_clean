Title: Anomalous Supersymmetry Breaking by Instantons

Authors: A. Casher, V. Elkonin and Y. Shamir

Comments: LaTeX, 24 pages, 8 figures (uuencoded)

We show that instantons violate a supersymmetric identity in a classicallysupersymmetric Higgs model with no massless fermions. This anomalous breakingarises because the correct perturbative expansion in the instanton sector isnot supersymmetric. The attempt to construct a manifestly supersymmetricexpansion generates infra-red divergences.
