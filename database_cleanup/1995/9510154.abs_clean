The path integral computation of field strength correlation functions for twodimensional Yang-Mills theories over Riemann surfaces is studied. Thecalculation is carried out by abelianization, which leads to correlators thatare topological. They are nontrivial as a result of the topologicalobstructions to the abelianization. It is shown in the large N limit on thesphere that the correlators undergo second order phase transitions at thecritical point. Our results are applied to a computation of contractible Wilsonloops.
