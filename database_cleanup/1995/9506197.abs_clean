Title: Remarks on chiral symmetry breaking with massless fermions

Comments: LaTex, 7 pages, one misleading remark corrected and a comment added

In this talk I present recent results on Lorentz covariant correlationfunctions $\langle q(p_1)\overline{q}(p_2)\rangle$ on the cone $p^2=0$. Inparticular, chiral symmetry breaking terms are constructed which resemblefermionic 2--point functions of 2--D CFT up to a scalar factor.
