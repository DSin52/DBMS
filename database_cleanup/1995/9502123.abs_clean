Using thermodynamic arguments we find that the probability that there are noeigenvalues in the interval (-s,\infty) in the double scaling limit ofHermitean matrix models is O(exp(-s^{2m+1})) as s\rightarrow+\infty.Herem=1,2,3.. determine the m^{th} multi-critical point of the levelof the transition zone where the eigenvalue density becomes vanishingly smallat the tail of the spectrum is \sim N^{(m-3/2)/(2m+1)} in agreement withearlier work based on the string equation.
