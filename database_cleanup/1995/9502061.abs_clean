In this monograph we prove that the nonlinear Lie algebra representation givenby the manifestly covariant Maxwell-Dirac (M-D) equations is integrable to aglobal nonlinear representation $U$ of the Poincar\'e group ${\cal P}_0$ on adifferentiable manifold ${\cal U}_\infty$ of small initial conditions for theM-D equations. This solves, in particular, the Cauchy problem for the M-Dequations, namely existence of global solutions for initial data in ${\calU}_\infty$ at $t=0$. The existence of modified wave operators $\Omega_+$ and$\Omega_-$ and asymptotic completeness is proved. The asymptoticrepresentations $U^{(\varepsilon)}_g = \Omega^{-1}_\varepsilon \circ U_g \circ\Omega_\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon = \pm$, $g \in {\cal P}_0$, turn out to benonlinear. A cohomological interpretation of the results in the spirit ofnonlinear representation theory and its connection to the infrared tail of theelectron is given.
