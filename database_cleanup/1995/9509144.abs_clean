In order to construct a massive tensor theory with a smooth massless limit,we apply the Batalin-Fradkin algorithm to the ordinary massive tensor theory.By introducing an auxiliary vector field all second-class constraints areconverted into first-class ones. We find a gauge-fixing condition whichproduces a massive tensor theory of desirable property.
