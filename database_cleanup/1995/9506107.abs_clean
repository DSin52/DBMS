The fusion procedure of dilute $A_L$ models is constructed. It has been shownconcerned with the $su(2)$ fusion rule mainly and the corresponding functionalrelations of commuting transfer matrices in the $su(2)$ fusion hierarchy arefound. Specially, it has been found that the fusion hierarchy does not close.These two types of fusion generate different solvable models, but, they are nottotally irrelevant. The $su(2)$ fusion of level $2$ is equivalent to the$su(3)$ fusion of level $(1,1)$. According to this relationship the Betheansatz of fused model of level $(1,1)$ in $su(3)$ hierarchy has beenrepresented by that of level $2$ in $su(2)$ fusion hierarchy.
