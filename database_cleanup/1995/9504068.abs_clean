Title: Higgs Mechanism and Symmetry Breaking without Redundant Variables

Comments: 27 pages, no figures

The Higgs mechanism is reconsidered in the canonical Weyl gauge formulationof quantized gauge theories, using an approach in which redundant degrees offreedom are eliminated. As a consequence, its symmetry aspects appear in adifferent light. All the established physics consequences of the Higgsmechanism are recovered without invoking gauge symmetry breaking. The occurenceof massless vector bosons in non-abelian Higgs models is interpreted as signalof spontaneous breakdown of certain global symmetries. Characteristicdifferences between the relevant ``displacement symmetries'' of QED and theGeorgi Glashow model are exhibited. Implications for the symmetry aspects ofthe electroweak sector of the standard model and the interpretation of thephysical photon as Goldstone boson are pointed out.
