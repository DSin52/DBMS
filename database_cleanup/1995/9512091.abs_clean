After recalling a few basic concepts from cosmology and string theory, I willdiscuss the main ideas/assumptions underlying string cosmology and show howthese lead to a two-parameter family of ``minimal" models. I will then explainhow to compute, in terms of those parameters, the spectrum of scalar, tensorand electromagnetic perturbations, point at their ($T$ and $S$-type) dualitysymmetries, and mention their most relevant physical consequences.
