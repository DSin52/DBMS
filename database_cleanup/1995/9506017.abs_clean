We study the theory of systems with constraints from the point of view of theformal theory of partial differential equations. For finite-dimensional systemswe show that the Dirac algorithm completes the equations of motion to aninvolutive system. We discuss the implications of this identification for fieldtheories and argue that the involution analysis is more general and flexiblethan the Dirac approach. We also derive intrinsic expressions for the number ofdegrees of freedom.
