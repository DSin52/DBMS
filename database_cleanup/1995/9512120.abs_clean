The dynamical algebra associated to a family of Isospectral OscillatorHamiltonians, named {\it Distorted Heisenberg Algebra} because its dependenceon a distortion parameter $W \geq 0$, has been recently studied. The connectionof this algebra with the Hilbert space of entire functions of growth (1/2, 2)is analized.
