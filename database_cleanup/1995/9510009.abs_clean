Effective theories with the matter content of the minimal supersymmetricStandard Model below the string scale M_string predict a wrong value for theweak--mixing angle sin^2\theta_W and strong coupling constant \alpha_S at thescale M_Z. To resolve this problem one needs large threshold corrections. Atthe same time one would like to avoid introducing new intermediate scales thatare small compared to M_string. Two requests which seem to be incompatible. Weshow how both requirements can be satisfied in a class of (0,2) heteroticsuperstring compactifications with a natural choice of the vevs of the modulifields entering the moduli dependent string threshold corrections.
