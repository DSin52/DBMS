Recently the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation for first order constrained systemshas been developed. In such formalism the equations of motion are written astotal differential equations in many variables. We generalize theHamilton-Jacobi formulation for singular systems with second order Lagrangiansand apply this new formulation to Podolsky electrodynamics, comparing with theresults obtained through Dirac's method.
