We study the topologically twisted osp(2|2)+osp(2|2) conformal superalgebra.The algebra includes the Lagrangians which are intrinsic to the topologicalfield theory and composed of fermionic generators. Studying the Lagrangiansthrough a gauge system of osp(2|2)+osp(2|2), geometrical features inherent toand the crucial roles which the fermionic generators play in the moduli spaceare clarified It is argued that there exists a specific relation between thetopological twist and the moduli problem through a geometrical aspect of thealgebra.
