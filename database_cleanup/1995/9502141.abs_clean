We revise the twistor--like superfield approach to describing super--p--branesby use of the basic principles of the group--manifold approach \cite{rheo}. Asuper--p--brane action is constructed solely of geometrical objects as theintegral over a (p+1)--surface. The Lagrangian is the external product ofsupervielbein differential forms in world supersurface and target superspacewithout any use of Lagrange multipliers. This allows one to escape the problemof infinite irreducible symmetries and redundant propagating fields. All theconstraints on the geometry of world supersurface and the conditions of itsembedding into target superspace arise from the action as differential formequations.
