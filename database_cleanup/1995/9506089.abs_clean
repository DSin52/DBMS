String equations of the $p$-th generalized Kontsevich model and thecompactified $c = 1$ string theory are re-examined in the language of the Todalattice hierarchy. As opposed to a hypothesis postulated in the literature, thegeneralized Kontsevich model at $p = -1$ does not coincide with the $c = 1$string theory at self-dual radius. A broader family of solutions of the Todalattice hierarchy including these models are constructed, and shown to satisfygeneralized string equations. The status of a variety of $c \le 1$ stringmodels is discussed in this new framework.
