Title: Higher Derivative Gravitation in Superstrings

Comments: Talk presented at STRINGS'95, University of Southern California, Los

Angeles, CA, March 13-18, 1995; 6 pages, latexA discussion of the number of degrees of freedom, and their dynamicalproperties, in higher derivative gravitational theories is presented. It isshown that non-vanishing $(C_{mnpq})^{2}$ terms arise in N=1, D=4 superstringLagrangians due to one-loop radiative corrections with light field internallines.
