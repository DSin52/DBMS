Title: Classical Duality Symmetries in Two Dimensions

Comments: 14 pages, latex

Many two-dimensional classical field theories have hidden symmetries thatform an infinite-dimensional algebra. For those examples that correspond toeffective descriptions of compactified superstring theories, the duality groupis expected to be a large discrete subgroup of the hidden symmetry group. Withthis motivation, we explore the hidden symmetries of principal chiral modelsand symmetric space models.
