Electric-magnetic duality and higher dimensional analogues are obtained assymmetries in generalized coset constructions, similar to the axial-vectorduality of two dimensional coset models described by Rocek and Verlinde. Wealso study global aspects of duality between p-forms and (d-p-2)-forms ind-manifolds. In particular, the modular duality anomaly is governed by theEuler character as in four and two dimensions. Duality transformations ofWilson line operator insertions are also considered.
