Sogami recently proposed the new idea to express Higgs particle as a kind ofgauge particle by prescribing the generalized covariant derivative with gaugeand Higgs fields operating on quark and lepton fields. The field strengths forboth the gauge and Higgs fields are defined by the commutators of the covariantderivative by which he could obtain the Yang-Mills Higgs Lagrangian in thestandard model. Inspired by Sogami's work, we present a modification of ourprevious scheme to formulate the spontaneously broken gauge theory innon-commutative geometry on the discrete space; Minkowski space multiplied bytwo points space by introducing the generation mixing matrix in operation ofthe generalized derivative on the more fundamental fields a_i(x,y) whichcompose the gauge and Higgs fields. The standard model is reconstructedaccording to the modified scheme, which does not yields not only any specialrelations between the particle masses but also the special restriction on theHiggs potential.
