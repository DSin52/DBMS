By employing the symmetries of the underlying conformal field theory, thetree-level K\"ahler potentials for untwisted moduli of the heterotic stringcompactifications on orbifolds with continuous Wilson lines are derived. Thesesymmetries act linearly on bosonic (toroidal and $E_8\times E_8$ gauge) stringcoordinates as well as on the untwisted (toroidal and continuous Wilson lines)moduli; they correspond to the scaling of toroidal moduli, the axionic shift oftoroidal moduli and the shift of the continuous Wilson line moduli. In turnsuch symmetries provide sufficient constraints to determine the form of thelow-energy effective action associated with the untwisted moduli up to amultiplicative factor.
