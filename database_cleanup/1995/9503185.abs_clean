Title: Loop equations for multi-cut matrix models

Comments: 17 pages, 1 figure

The loop equation for the complex one-matrix model with a multi-cut structureis derived and solved in the planar limit. An iterative scheme for higher genuscontributions to the free energy and the multi-loop correlators is presentedfor the two-cut model, where explicit results are given up to and includinggenus two. The double-scaling limit is analyzed and the relation to the one-cutsolution of the hermitian and complex one-matrix model is discussed.
