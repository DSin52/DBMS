superspaceComments: 18 pages, LaTeX, Talk given at the Seminar ``Quantum Gravity'', June

12-19, 1995 MoscowWe present a manifestly supersymmetric off-shell formulation of a wide classof $(4,4)$ $2D$ sigma models with torsion and both commuting and non-commutingleft and right complex structures in the harmonic superspace with a double setof $SU(2)$ harmonic variables. The distinguishing features of the relevantensuring a correct number of physical degrees of freedom; (ii) an infinitetower of auxiliary fields. This action is derived from the most general one byimposing the integrability condition which follows from the commutativity ofthe left and right analyticity-preserving harmonic derivatives. For aparticular class of such models we explicitly demonstrate the non-commutativityof complex structures on the bosonic target.
