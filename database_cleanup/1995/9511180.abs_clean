We find low energy equivalences between $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theorieswith different simple gauge groups with and without matter. We give aconstruction of equivalences based on subgroups and find all examples withmaximal simple subgroups. This is used to solve some theories with exceptionalgauge groups $G_2$ and $F_4$. We are also able to solve an $E_6$ theory on acodimension one submanifold of its moduli space.
