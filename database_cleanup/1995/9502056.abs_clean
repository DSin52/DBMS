We show that a complete covariantization of the chiral constraint in theFloreanini-Jackiw necessitates an infinite number of auxiliary Wess-Zuminofields otherwise the covariantization is only partial and unable to remove thenonlocality in the chiral boson operator. We comment on recent works that claimto obtain covariantization through the use of Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin method,that uses just one Wess-Zumino field.
