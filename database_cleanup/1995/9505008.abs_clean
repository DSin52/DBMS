We consider the Hamiltonian of the closed $SU(2)_{q}$ invariant chain. Weproject a particular class of statistical models belonging to the unitaryminimal series. A particular model corresponds to a particular value of thecoupling constant. The operator content is derived. This class of models hascharge-dependent boundary conditions. In simple cases (Ising, 3-state Potts)corresponding Hamiltonians are constructed. These are non-local as the originalspin chain.
