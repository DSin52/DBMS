Title: OCTONIONS

Comments: 7 pages, latex, no figures

The Leech lattice, $\Lambda_{24}$, is represented on the space of octonionic3-vectors. It is built from two octonionic representations of $E_{8}$, and isreached via $\Lambda_{16}$. It is invariant under the octonion index cyclingand doubling maps.
