Title: Quasi-exactly solvable problems and random matrix theory

Comments: nine pages in Latex, no figures

There exists an exact relationship between the quasi-exactly solvableproblems of quantum mechanics and models of square and rectangular randomcomplex matrices. This relationship enables one to reduce the problem ofconstructing topological ($1/N$) expansions in random matrix models to theproblem of constructing semiclassical expansions for observables inquasi-exactly solvable problems. Lie algebraic aspects of this relationship arealso discussed.
