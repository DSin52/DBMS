We consider a six-dimensional solitonic string solution described by aconformal chiral null model with non-trivial $N=4$ superconformal transversepart. It can be interpreted as a five-dimensional dyonic solitonic string woundaround a compact fifth dimension. The conformal model is regular with theshort-distance (`throat') region equivalent to a WZW theory. At distanceslarger than the compactification scale the solitonic string reduces to a dyonicstatic spherically-symmetric black hole of toroidally compactified heteroticstring. The new four-dimensional solution is parameterised by five charges,saturates the Bogomol'nyi bound and has nontrivial dilaton-axion field andmoduli fields of two-torus. When acted by combined T- and S-dualitytransformations it serves as a generating solution for all the staticspherically-symmetric BPS-saturated configurations of the low-energy heteroticstring theory compactified on six-torus. Solutions with regular horizons havethe global space-time structure of extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black holes withthe non-zero thermodynamic entropy which depends only on conserved (quantised)charge vectors. The independence of the thermodynamic entropy on moduli andaxion-dilaton couplings strongly suggests that it should have a microscopicinterpretation as counting degeneracy of underlying string configurations. Thisinterpretation is supported by arguments based on the correspondingsix-dimensional conformal field theory. The expression for the level of the WZWtheory describing the throat region implies a renormalisation of the stringtension by a product of magnetic charges, thus relating the entropy and thenumber of oscillations of the solitonic string in compact directions.
