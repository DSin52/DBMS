The chiral boson actions of Floreanini and Jackiw (FJ), and of McClain,Wu andYu (MWY) have been recently shown to be different representations of the samechiral boson theory. MWY displays manifest covariance and also a (gauge)symmetry that is hidden in the FJ side, which, on the other hand, displays thephysical spectrum in a simple manner. We make use of the covariance of the MWYrepresentation for the chiral boson to couple it to background gravity showingexplicitly the equivalence with the previous results for the FJ representation
