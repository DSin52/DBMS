The two dimensional surface of a sphere can be parametrized by coordinatesrepresenting two charged pions acting as Goldstone bosons of a broken $SU_2$symmetry. We construct in full concrete detail, and in a general class ofcoordinate systems, all the relevant structure forming a framework for this lowenergy effective theory.
