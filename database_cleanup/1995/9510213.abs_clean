Title: Doubly Supersymmetric Geometric Approach for Heterotic String

Generalized Action Principle to Exactly Solvable Nonlinear EquationsComments: 25 pages. LATEX. Submitted to the Proc. of the Austrian-- Ukrainian

Workshop on Mathematical Physics, Rakhov, Ukraine, 1995, September 11-16The previously proposed generalized action principle approach tosupersymmetric extended objects is considered in some details for the case ofheterotic string in $D=3, 4, 6 ~and~ 10$ space--time dimensions. The proof ofthe 'off--shell' superdiffeomorphism invariance of the generalized action ispresented. The doubly supersymmetric geometric approach to heterotic string isconstructed on the basis of generalized action principle (instead of thegeometrodynamic condition, used for this previously). It is demonstrated that$D=3$ heterotic string is described by $n=(1,0)$ supersymmetric generalizationof the nonlinear Liouville equation.
