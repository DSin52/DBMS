Title: Modular Covariance, PCT, Spin and Statistics

Authors: Daniele Guido (U. Roma Tor Vergata)

Comments: 15 pages, plain TeX, talk presented to the Colloquium "New Problems

in the General Theory of Fields and Particles", Paris 1994. To appear in thespecial issue of the Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e devoted to the ColloquiumJournal-ref: Annales Poincare Phys.Theor. 63 (1995) 383-398

The notion of modular covariance is reviewed and the reconstruction of thePoincar\'e group extended to the low-dimensional case. The relations with thePCT symmetry and the Spin and Statistics theorem are described.
