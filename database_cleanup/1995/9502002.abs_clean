A two dimensional string effective action is obtained by dimensionally reducingthe bosonic part of the ten dimensional heterotic string effective action. Itis shown that this effective action, with a few restrictions on somebackgrounds describes a two dimensional model which admits an infinite sequenceof nonlocal conserved currents.
