Title: Strings, Unification and dilaton/moduli-induced SUSY-breaking

Comments: Few missprints fixed; reference added

I discuss several issues concerning the use of string models as unifiedtheories of all interactions. After a short review of gauge couplingunification in the string context, I discuss possible motivations for theconstruction of $SU(5)$ and $SO(10)$ String-GUTs. I describe the constructionof such String-GUTs using different orbifold techniques and emphasize thoseproperties which could be general. Although $SO(10)$ and $SU(5)$ String-GUTsare relatively easy to build, the spectrum bellow the GUT scale is in generalbigger than that of the MSSM and includes colour octets and $SU(2)$ triplets.The phenomenological prospects of these theories are discussed. I then turn todiscuss soft SUSY-breaking terms obtained under the assumption ofdilaton/moduli dominance in SUSY-breaking string schemes. I underline theunique finiteness pr of the soft terms induced by the dilaton sector. Theseimproved finiteness properties seem to be related to the underlying $SU(1,1)$structure of the dilaton couplings. I conclude with an outlook and somespeculations regarding $N=1$ duality.
