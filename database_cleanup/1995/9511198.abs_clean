In presence of string solitons, index theorems for the generalised Diracoperators have to be revisited. We show that in supersymmetric configurationsthe fermionic operators decouple, so that there are no mixing effects betweendifferent fermions in the index theorems. We extend the index theorems inpresence of torsion to the generic case of manifolds with boundary, whichnaturally appear in string solutions and apply this result to the solitonsolution by Callan, Harvey and Strominger.
