Factorization of string amplitudes is one way of constructing stringinteraction vertices. We show that correlation functions in string theory canbe conveniently factorized using loop variables representing delta functionals.We illustrate this construction with some examples where one particle isoff-shell. These vertices are ``correct'' in the sense that they areguaranteed, by construction, to reproduce S-matrix elements when combined withpropagators in a well defined way.
