Title: KdV type systems and W-algebras in the Drinfeld-Sokolov approach

Comments: LaTex, 16 pages, talk given at the Marseille 95 conference on

W-symmetry. An error in remark c was correctedIntegrable SystemsThe generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov construction of KdV systems is reviewed inthe case of an arbitrary affine Lie algebra paying particular attention toHamiltonian aspects and $\W$-algebras. Some extensions of known results as wellas a new interpretation of the construction are also presented.
