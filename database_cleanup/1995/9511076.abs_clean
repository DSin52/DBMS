The star-matrix models are difficult to solve due to the multiple powers ofthe Vandermonde determinants in the partition function. We apply to thesemodels a modified Q-matrix approach and we get results consistent with thoseobtained by other methods.As examples we study the inhomogenous gaussian modelon Bethe tree and matrix $q$-Potts-like model. For the last model in thespecial cases $q=2$ and $q=3$, we write down explicit formulas whichdeterminate the critical behaviour of the system.For $q=2$ we argue that thecritical behaviour is indeed that of the Ising model on the $\phi^3$ lattice.
