We analyze the constraints of general coordinate invariance for quantumtheories possessing conformal symmetry in four dimensions. The character ofthese constraints simplifies enormously on the Einstein universe $R \timesS^3$. The $SO(4,2)$ global conformal symmetry algebra of this space determinesuniquely a finite shift in the Hamiltonian constraint from its classical value.In other words, the global Wheeler-De Witt equation is {\it modified} at thequantum level in a well-defined way in this case. We argue that the highermoments of $T^{00}$ should not be imposed on the physical states {\it a priori}either, but only the weaker condition $\langle \dot T^{00} \rangle = 0$. Wepresent an explicit example of the quantization and diffeomorphism constraintson $R \times S^3$ for a free conformal scalar field.
