A study is made of the implications of heterotic string $T$-duality andextended gauge symmetry for the conjectured equivalence of heterotic and Type Isuperstrings. While at first sight heterotic string world-sheet dynamicsappears to conflict with Type I perturbation theory, a closer look shows thatType I perturbation theory ``miraculously'' breaks down, in some cases vianovel mechanisms, whenever the heterotic string has massless particles notpresent in Type I perturbation theory. This strongly suggests that the twotheories actually are equivalent. As further evidence in the same direction, weshow that the Dirichlet one-brane of type I string theory has the sameworld-sheet structure as the heterotic string.
