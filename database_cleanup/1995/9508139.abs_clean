In the framework of the prepotential description of superspacetwo-dimensional $(2,2)$ supergravity, we discuss the construction of invariantintegrals. In addition to the full superspace measure, we derive the measurefor chiral superspace, and obtain the explicit expressions for going fromsuperspace actions to component actions. We consider both the minimal $U_A(1)$and the extended $U_V(1) \otimes U_A(1)$ theories.
