By studying the pure Yang-Mills theory on a circle, as well as an adjointscalar coupled to the gauge field on a circle, we propose a quenchingprescription in which the combination of the spatial component of the gaugefield and $P$ is treated as a dynamic variable. Averaging over momentum is notnecessary, therefore the usual ultraviolet cut-off is eliminated. We then applythis prescription to study the large $N$ two dimensional supersymmetric gaugetheory. An one dimensional supersymmetric matrix model is obtained. It is notknown whether this model can be solved exactly. However, an extended model withone more complex fermion is exactly solvable, with $N=1$ supersymmetry asParisi-Sourlas supersymmetry. The exact solvability may have some implicationsfor the $N=1$ quenched model.
