We study the theory of non-relativistic matter with non-Abelian $U(2)$Chern-Simons gauge interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions. We adopt the mean fieldapproximation in the current-algebra formulation already applied to the Abeliananyons. We first show that this method is able to describe both ``boson-based''and ``fermion-based'' anyons and yields consistent results over the whole rangeof fractional statistics. In the non-Abelian theory, we find a superfluid (andsuperconductive) phase, which is smoothly connected with the Abelian superfluidphase originally discovered by Laughlin. The characteristic massless excitationis the Goldstone particle of the specific mechanism of spontaneous symmetrybreaking. An additional massive mode is found by diagonalizing the non-Abelian,non-local, Hamiltonian in the radial gauge.
