Title: Differential Geometry and Integrability of the Hamiltonian System of a

Closed Vortex FilamentComments: Title is changed ('a' is added). A mistake (absence of stating

F-linearity condition of a skew-adjoint op., Sect.4) is corrected. Onereference is added. The other changes are minor. 12 pages, LaTeXSystemsJournal-ref: Lett.Math.Phys. 39 (1997) 229-241

The system of a closed vortex filament is an integrable Hamiltonian one,namely, a Hamiltonian system with an infinite sequense of constants of motionin involution. An algebraic framework is given for the aim of describingdifferential geometry of this system. A geometrical structure related to theintegrability of this system is revealed. It is not a bi-Hamiltonian structurebut similar one. As a related topic, a remark on the inspection of J.Langer andR.Perline, J.Nonlinear Sci.1, 71 (1991), is given.
