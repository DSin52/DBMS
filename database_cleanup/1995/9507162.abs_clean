Title: Standard Grand Unification from Superstrings

Comments: 7 pages, Latex, no figures. Talk at Susy 95. Paris, May 1995

Recent developments about the construction of standard $SO(10)$ and $SU(5)$grand unified theories from 4-dimensional superstrings are presented. Explicittechniques involving higher level affine Lie algebras, for obtaining suchstringGUTs from symmetric orbifolds are discussed. Special emphasis is put onthe different constraints and selection rules for model building in this stringframework, trying to disentangle those which are generic from those dependingon the orbifold construction proposed. Some phenomenological implications fromsuch constraints are briefly discussed.
