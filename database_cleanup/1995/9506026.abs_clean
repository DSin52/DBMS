We show that the instantons induce the abelian monopoles in the MaximalAbelian Projection of $SU(2)$ gluodynamics. As an example we consider the caseof one instanton and the case of a set of instantons arranged along a straightline. The abelian monopoles which are induced by instantons may play some rolein the confinement scenario.
