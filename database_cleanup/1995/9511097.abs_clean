Title: Gauge invariant reformulation and BRST quantization of the nonconfining

Schwinger modelComments: 14 pages, Latex file, No figure

A new generalization of the vector Schwinger model is considered where gaugesymmetry is broken at the quantum mechanical level. By proper extension of thephase space this broken symmetry has been restored. Also an equivalent firstclass theory is reformulated in the actual phase space using Mitra andRajaraman's prescription \cite{mr1,mr2}. A BRST invariant effective action isalso formulated. The new dynamical fields introduced, turn into Wess-Zuminoscalar.
