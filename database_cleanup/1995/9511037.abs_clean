Title: Topological Quantum Field Theory

Authors: J.M.F. Labastida

Comments: latex, 17 pages, talk given at the IV Fall Workshop on Differential

Geometry and its Applications, 1995A brief introduction to Topological Quantum Field Theory as well as adescription of recent progress made in the field is presented. I concentratemainly on the connection between Chern-Simons gauge theory and Vassilievinvariants, and Donaldson theory and its generalizations and Seiberg-Witteninvariants. Emphasis is made on the usefulness of these relations to obtainexplicit expressions for topological invariants, and on the universal structureunderlying both systems.
