In the present paper we obtain some integrable generalisations of the Todasystem generated by flat connection forms taking values in higher ${\bfZ}$--grading subspaces of a simple Lie algebra, and construct their generalsolutions. One may think of our systems as describing some new fields of thematter type coupled to the standard Toda systems. This is of special interestin nonabelian Toda theories where the latter involve black hole target spacemetrics. We also give a derivation of our conformal system on the base of theHamiltonian reduction of the WZNW model; and discuss a relation between abelianand nonabelian systems generated by a gauge transformation that maps the firstgrading description to the second. The latter involves grades larger than one.
