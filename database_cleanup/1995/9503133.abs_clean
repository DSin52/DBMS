It is shown that there exists such collection of variables that the standardQCD Lagrangian can be represented as the sum of usual Palatini Lagrangian forEinstein general relativity and the Lagrangian of matter and some other fieldswhere the tetrad fields and the metric are constructed from initial $SU(3)$Yang - Mills fields.
