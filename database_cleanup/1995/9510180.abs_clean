An action principle for spacetimes with the topology of an Euclideanblack-hole is given. The gravitational field is described by the ordinaryvolume degrees of freedom plus additional surface fields at the horizon. Thesurface degrees of freedom correspond to diffeomorphisms on the sphere at thehorizon and a field of ``opening angles''. General covariance forces thesurface modes to be confined to a box of an unusual exponential shape, whosevolume must be specified as part of the definition of the statistical ensemble.This gives rise to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
