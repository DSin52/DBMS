The phase structure of a $(2+1)$ - dimensional model of relativistic fermionswith a four fermi interaction is analyzed in the strong coupling regime usingthe large $N$ perturbation theory. It is shown that, this model exhibits a lowtemperature superconducting phase due to the vortex-anti vortex binding viaKosterlitz-Thouless mechanism. Above a critical temperature, vortices unbindand superconductivity is destroyed; at a still higher temperature the vacuumexpectation value of a neutral order parameter vanishes. The ground staterespects parity and time reversal symmetries.
