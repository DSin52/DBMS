Using canonical quantization we find the Virasoro centre for a class ofconformally-invariant interacting Wess-Zumino-Witten theories. The theorieshave a group structure similar to that of Toda theories (both abelian andnon-abelian) but the usual Toda constraints on the coupling constants arerelaxed and the theories are not necessarily integrable. The general formulafor the Virasoro centre is compared to that derived by BRST methods in the Todacase, and helps to explain the structure of the latter.
