The total twist number, which represents the first non-trivial Vassiliev knotinvariant, is derived from the second order expression of the Wilson loopexpectation value in the Chern-Simons theory. Using the well-known fact thatthe analytical expression is an invariant, a non-recursive formulation of thetotal twist based on the evaluation of knot diagrams is constructed by anappropriate deformation of the knot line in the three-dimensional Euclidianspace. The relation to the original definition of the total twist iselucidated.
