Title: Universality of the Tearing Phase in Matrix Models

Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure non included

The spontaneous symmetry breaking associated to the tearing of a randomsurface, where large dynamical holes fill the surface, was recently analizedobtaining a non-universal critical exponent on a border phase. Here the issueof universality is explained by an independent analysis. The one hole sector ofthe model is useful to manifest the origin of the (limited) non-universalbehaviour, that is the existence of two inequivalent critical points.
