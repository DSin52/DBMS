Title: Adelic Integrable Systems

Authors: Mircea Pigli

Comments: 23 pages, uses plain TEX

Incorporating the zonal spherical function (zsf) problems on real and$p$-adic hyperbolic planes into a Zakharov-Shabat integrable system setting, wefind a wide class of integrable evolutions which respect the number-theoreticproperties of the zsf problem. This means that at {\it all} times these realand $p$-adic systems can be unified into an adelic system with an $S$-matrixwhich involves (Dirichlet, Langlands, Shimura...) L-functions.
