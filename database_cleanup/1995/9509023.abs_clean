We investigate whether dual strings could be solutions of themagnetohydrodynamics equations in the limit of infinite conductivity. We findthat the induction equation is satisfied, and we discuss the Navier-Stokesequation (without viscosity) with the Lorentz force included. We argue that thedual string equations (with a non-universal maximum velocity) should describethe large scale motion of narrow magnetic flux tubes, because of a largereparametrization (gauge) invariance of the magnetic and electric stringfields. It is shown that the energy-momentum tensor for the dual string can bereinterpreted as an energy-momentum tensor for magnetohydrodynamics, providedcertain conditions are satisfied. We also give a brief discussion of the casewhen magnetic monopoles are included, and indicate how this can lead to anon-relativistic "electrohydrodynamics" picture of confinement.
