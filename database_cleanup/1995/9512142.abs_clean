Strassler's formulation of the string-derived Bern-Kosower formalism isextended to consider QED processes in homogeneous constant external field. Acompact expression for the contribution of the one-loop with arbitrary numberof external photon lines is given for scalar QED. Extension to spinor QED isshortly discussed.
