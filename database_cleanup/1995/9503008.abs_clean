Title: 2D Principal Chiral Field at Large N as a Possible Solvable

2D String TheoryComments: 12 pages. Seminar presented at the 1994 Les Houches Summer School

``Fluctuating Geometries in Statistical Mechanics and Field Theory.''(based on papers written with V.A. Fateev and P.B. Wiegmann)We present the exact and explicit solution of the principal chiral field intwo dimensions for an infinitely large rank group manifold.  The energy ofthe ground state is explicitly found for the external Noether's fields ofan arbitrary magnitude.  At small field we found an inverse logarithmicsingularity in the ground state energy at the mass gap which indicates thatat $N=\infty$ the spectrum of the theory contains extended objects ratherthan pointlike particles.
