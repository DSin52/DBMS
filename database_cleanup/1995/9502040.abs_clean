We consider the six-vertex model with anti-periodic boundary conditions acrossa finite strip. The row-to-row transfer matrix is diagonalised by the`commuting transfer matrices' method. {}From the exact solution we obtain anindependent derivation of the interfacial tension of the six-vertex model inthe anti-ferroelectric phase. The nature of the corresponding integrableboundary condition on the $XXZ$ spin chain is also discussed.
