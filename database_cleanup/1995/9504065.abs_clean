We consider a N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons model, coupled tomatter, in the Wess-Zumino gauge. The theory is characterized by a superalgebrafield dependent gauge transformations, which give rise to an infinite algebra,and equations of motion. The aim is to put the formalism in a closed form,off-shell, without introducing auxiliary fields. In order to perform that, wecollect all the symmetries of the model into a unique nilpotent Slavnov-Tayloroperator. Furthermore, we prove the renormalizability of the model through theanalysis of the cohomology arising from the generalized Slavnov-Tayloroperator. In particular, we show that the model is free of anomaly.
