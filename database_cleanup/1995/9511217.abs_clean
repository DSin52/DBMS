We study the renormalizability of quantum gravity near two dimensions. Ourformalism starts with the tree action which is invariant under the volumepreserving diffeomorphism. We identify the BRS invariance which originates fromthe full diffeomorphism invariance. We study the Ward-Takahashi identities todetermine the general structure of the counter terms. We prove to all ordersthat the counter terms can be supplied by the coupling and the wave functionrenormalization of the tree action. The bare action can be constructed to bethe Einstein action form which ensures the full diffeomorphism invariance.
