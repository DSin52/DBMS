We study quantum aspects of the accelerated black holes in some detail.Explicitly shown is the fact that a uniform acceleration stabilizes certaincharged black holes against the well-known thermal evaporation. Furthermore, aclose inspection of the geometry reveals that this is possible only fornear-extremal black holes and that most nonextremal varieties continue toevaporate with a modified spectrum under the acceleration. We also introduce atwo-dimensional toy model where the energy-momentum flow is easily obtained forgeneral accelerations, and find the behavior to be in accordance with thefour-dimensional results. After a brief comparison to the classical system of auniformly accelerated charge, we close by pointing out the importance of thisresult in the WKB expansion of the black hole pair-creation rate.
