Classical integrability is investigated for affine Toda field theories in thepresence of a constant background tensor field. This leads to a further set ofdiscrete possibilities for integrable boundary conditions depending upon thetime-derivative of the fields at the boundary but containing no free parametersother than the bulk coupling constant.
