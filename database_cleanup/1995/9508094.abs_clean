In six spacetime dimensions, the heterotic string is dual to a Type $IIA$string. On further toroidal compactification to four spacetime dimensions, theheterotic string acquires an $SL(2,\BbbZ)_S$ strong/weak coupling duality andan $SL(2,\BbbZ)_T \times SL(2,\BbbZ)_U$ target space duality acting on thedilaton/axion, complex Kahler form and the complex structure fields $S,T,U$respectively. Strong/weak duality in $D=6$ interchanges the roles of $S$ and$T$ in $D=4$ yielding a Type $IIA$ string with fields $T,S,U$. This suggeststhe existence of a third string (whose six-dimensional interpretation is moreobscure) that interchanges the roles of $S$ and $U$. It corresponds in fact toa Type $IIB$ string with fields $U,T,S$ leading to a four-dimensionalstring/string/string triality. Since $SL(2,\BbbZ)_S$ is perturbative for theType $IIB$ string, this $D=4$ triality implies $S$-duality for the heteroticstring and thus fills a gap left by $D=6$ duality. For all three strings thetotal symmetry is $SL(2,\BbbZ)_S \times O(6,22;\BbbZ)_{TU}$. The$O(6,22;\BbbZ)$ is {\it perturbative} for the heterotic string but contains theconjectured {\it non-perturbative} $SL(2,\BbbZ)_X$, where $X$ is the complexscalar of the $D=10$ Type $IIB$ string. Thus four-dimensional triality alsoprovides a (post-compactification) justification for this conjecture. Weinterpret the $N=4$ Bogomol'nyi spectrum from all three points of view. Inparticular we generalize the Sen-Schwarz formula for short multiplets toinclude intermediate multiplets also and discuss the corresponding black holespectrum both for the $N=4$ theory and for a truncated $S$--$T$--$U$ symmetric$N=2$ theory. Just as the first two strings are described by thefour-dimensional {\it elementary} and {\it dual solitonic} solutions, so the
