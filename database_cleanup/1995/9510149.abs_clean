Title: Curiosities at c=-2

Comments: 26 pages, LaTeX

Conformal field theory at $c=-2$ provides the simplest example of a theorywith ``logarithmic'' operators. We examine in detail the $(\xi,\eta)$ ghostsystem and Coulomb gas construction at $c=-2$ and show that, incontradistinction to minimal models, they can not be described in terms ofconformal families of {\em primary\/} fields alone but necessarily containreducible but indecomposable representations of the Virasoro algebra. We thenpresent a construction of ``logarithmic'' operators in terms of ``symplectic''fermions displaying a global $SL(2)$ symmetry. Orbifolds with respect to finitesubgroups of $SL(2)$ are reminiscent of the $ADE$ classification of $c=1$modular invariant partition functions, but are isolated models and not linkedby massless flows.
