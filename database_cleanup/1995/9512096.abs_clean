Title: Weak quasitriangular Quasi-Hopf algebra structure of minimal models

Comments: 18 pages, amslatex, proof of prop. 6.2 corrected

The chiral vertex operators for the minimal models are constructed and usedto define a fusion product of representations. The existence of commutativityand associativity operations is proved. The matrix elements of theassociativity operations are shown to be given in terms of the 6-j symbols ofthe weak quasitriangular quasi-Hopf algebra obtained by truncating $\usl$ atroots of unity.
