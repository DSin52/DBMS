A microscopic formulation of Haldane's exclusions statistics is given in termsof a priori occupation probabilities of states. It is shown that negativeprobabilities are always necessary to reproduce fractional statistics. Based onthis formulation, a path-integral realization for systems with exclusionstatistics is derived. This has the advantage of being generalizable tointeracting systems, and can be used as the starting point for furthergeneralizations of statistics. As a byproduct, the vanishing of the heatcapacity at zero temperature for exclusion statistics systems is proved.
