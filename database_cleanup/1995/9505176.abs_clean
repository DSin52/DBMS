Title: Massive Dilaton and Topological Gravity

Comments: 10 pages, harvmac

A model in which the massive dilaton is introduced by minimally extending thetwo dimensional topological gravity is studied semi-classically. The theory isno longer topological because of the explicit Weyl scale symmetry breaking. Dueto the dilaton the semiclassical stress-energy tensor gets renormalized and itis shown how the gravitational background coupled to the the dilaton depends onthe dilaton mass as well as the renormalization mass scale, but not on theNewton's constant.
