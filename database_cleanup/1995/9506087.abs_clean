New aspects of the complex sine-Gordon theory are addressed through thereformulation of the theory in terms of the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten action. Adual transformation between the theory for the coupling constant $\b > 0$ andthe theory for $\b < 0$ is given which agrees with the Krammers-Wannier dualityin the context of perturbed conformal field theory. The B\"{a}cklund transformand the nonlinear superposition rule for the complex sine-Gordon theory arepresented and from which, exact solutions, solitons and breathers with U(1)charge, are derived. We clarify topological and nontopological nature ofneutral and charged solitons respectively, and discuss about the dualitybetween the vector and the axial U(1) charges.
