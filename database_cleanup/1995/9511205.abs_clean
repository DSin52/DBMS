A new four-dimensional $N=1$ superfield model is suggested. The model isinduced by supertrace anomaly of matter superfields in curved superspace andleads to effective theory of supergravity chiral compensator. A renormalizationstructure of this model is studied, one-loop counterterms are calculated andrenormalization group equations are investigated. It is shown that the theoryunder consideration is infrared free.
