We quantize the three-dimensional $BF$-model using axial gauge conditions.Exploiting the rich symmetry-structure of the model we show that theGreen-functions correspond to tree graphs and can be obtained as the uniquesolution of the Ward-Identities. Furthermore, we will show that the theory canbe uniquely determined by symmetry considerations without the need of an actionprinciple.
