We study the degenerating limits of superconformal theories forcompactifications on singular K3 and Calabi-Yau threefolds. We find that inboth cases the degeneration involves creating an Euclidean two-dimensionalblack hole coupled weakly to the rest of the system. Moreover we find that theconformal theory of A_n singularities of K3 are the same as that of thesymmetric fivebrane. We also find intriguing connections between ADE (1,n)non-critical strings and singular limits of superconformal theories on thecorresponding ALE space.
