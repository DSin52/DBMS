We discuss SU(N) gluo-dynamics at finite temperature and on a spatial circle.We show that the effective action for the Polyakov Loop operator is a onedimensional gauged SU(N) principle chiral model with variables in the loopspace and loop algebra of the gauge group. We find that the quantum states canbe characterized by a discrete $\theta$-angle which appears with a particular1-dimensional topological term in the effective action. We present an explicitcomputation of the partition function and obtain the spectrum of the model,together with its dependence on the discrete theta angle. We also presentexplicit formulae for 2-point correlators of Polyakov loop operators and analgorithm for computing all N-point correlators.
