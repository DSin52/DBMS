Title: Nonequilibrium problems in quantum field theory and Schwinger's Closed

Time Path formalismComments: 19 pages, 4 figures

We review the closed time path formalism of Schwinger using a path integralapproach. We apply this formalism to the study of pair production from strongexternal fields as well as the time evolution of a nonequilibrium chiral phasetransition.
