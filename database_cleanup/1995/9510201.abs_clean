The general structure of the Sp(2) covariant version of the field-antifieldquantization of general constrained systems in the Lagrangian formalism, the socalled triplectic quantization, as presented in our previous paper withA.M.Semikhatov is further generalized and clarified.We present new unified expressions for the generating operators which are moreinvariant and which yield a natural realization of the operator V^a and providefor a geometrical explanation for its presence. This V^a operator provides thenfor an invariant definition of a degenerate Poisson bracket on the triplecticmanifold being nondegenerate on a naturally defined submanifold. We alsodefine inverses to nondegenerate antitriplectic metrics and give a naturalgeneralization of the conventional calculus of exterior differential formswhich e g explains the properties of these inverses. Finally we define and givea consistent treatment of second class hyperconstraints.
