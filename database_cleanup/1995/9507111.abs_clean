The instanton configuration in the SU(2)-gauge system with a Higgs doublet isconstructed by using the new valley method. This method defines theconfiguration by an extension of the field equation and allows the exactconversion of the quasi-zero eigenmode to a collective coordinate. It does notrequire ad-hoc constraints used in the current constrained instanton method andprovides a better mathematical formalism than the constrained instanton method.The resulting instanton, which we call ``valley instanton'', is shown to havedesirable behaviors. The result of the numerical investigation is alsopresented.
