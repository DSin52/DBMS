We construct two classes of higher-derivative supergravity theoriesgeneralizing Einstein supergravity. We explore their dynamical content as wellas their vacuum structure. The first class is found to be equivalent toEinstein supergravity coupled to a single chiral superfield. It has a uniquestable vacuum solution except in a special case, when it becomes identical to asimple no-scale theory. The second class is found to be equivalent to Einsteinsupergravity coupled to two chiral superfields and has a richer vacuumstructure. It is demonstrated that theories of the second class can possess astable vacuum with vanishing cosmological constant that spontaneously breakssupersymmetry. We present an explicit example of this phenomenon and comparethe result with the Polonyi model.
