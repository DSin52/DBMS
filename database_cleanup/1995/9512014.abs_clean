Title: Is a truly marginal perturbation of the $G_k\times G_k$ WZNW model at

$k=-2c_V(G)$ an exception to the rule?Comments: Latex file, 12 pp

It is shown that there exists a truly marginal deformation of the direct sumof two $G_k$ WZNW models at $k=-2c_V(G)$ (where $c_V(G)$ is the eigenvalue ofthe quadratic Casimir operator in the adjoint representation of the group $G$)which does not seem to fit the Chaudhuri-Schwartz criterion for truly marginalperturbations. In addition, a continuous family of WZNW models is constructed.
