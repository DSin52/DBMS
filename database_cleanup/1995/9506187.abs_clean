The canonical structure of higher dimensional pure Chern-Simons theories isanalysed. It is shown that these theories have generically a non-vanishingnumber of local degrees of freedom, even though they are obtained by means of atopological construction. This number of local degrees of freedom is computedas a function of the spacetime dimension and the dimension of the gauge group.
