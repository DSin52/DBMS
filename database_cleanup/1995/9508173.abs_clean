Title: Gaugino Condensation and the Vacuum Expectation Value of the Dilaton

Comments: 10 pages, 1 postscript figure, uses epsf

The mechanism of gaugino condensation has emerged as a prime candidate forsupersymmetry breakdown in low energy effective supergravity (string) models.One of the open questions in this approach concerns the size of the gaugecoupling constant which is dynamically fixed through the vev of the dilaton. Weargue that a nontrivial gauge kinetic function $f(S)$ could solve the potentialproblem of a runaway dilaton. The actual form of $f(S)$ might be constrained bysymmetry arguments.
