Title: Amplification of Vacuum Fluctuations in String Cosmology Backgrounds

Comments: 25 pages, Plain TEX, 3 figures available by fax upon request, to

appear in "Proc. of the 3rd Colloque Cosmologie" (Observatoire de Paris,7-9June 1995)Inflationary string cosmology backgrounds can amplify perturbations in a moreefficient way than conventional inflationary backgrounds, because theperturbation amplitude may grow - instead of being constant - outside thehorizon. If not gauged away, the growing mode can limit the range of validityof a linearized description of perturbations. Even in the restricted linearrange, however, this enhanced amplification may lead to phenomenologicalconsequences unexpected in the context of the standard inflationary scenario.In particular, the production of a relic graviton background strong enough tobe detected in future by LIGO, and/or the generation of a stochasticelectromagnetic background strong enough to seed the cosmic magnetic fields andto be responsible for the observed large scale anisotropy.
