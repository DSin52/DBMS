In the present article we solve the Dirac equation in a de Sitter universewhen a constant electric field is present. Using the Bogoliubovtransformations, we compute the rate of spin 1/2 created particles by theelectric field. We compare our results with the scalar case. We also analyzethe behavior of the density of particles created in the limit H=0, when deSitter background reduces to a flat space-time.
