The conformal spectra of the critical dilute A-D-E lattice models are studiednumerically. The results strongly indicate that, in branches 1 and 2, thesemodels provide realizations of the complete A-D-E classification of unitaryminimal modular invariant partition functions given by Cappelli, Itzykson andZuber. In branches 3 and 4 the results indicate that the modular invariantpartition functions factorize. Similar factorization results are also obtainedfor two-colour lattice models.
