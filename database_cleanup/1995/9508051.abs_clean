A physical system composed by a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity anda thermal reservoir, as in thermo field dynamics, all of them in curved spacetime, is considered. When the formalism of thermo field dynamics is generalizedto the above mentioned case, an amplification in the number of createdparticles is predicted.
