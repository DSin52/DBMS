Title: The low energy effective Lagrangian for photon interactions in any

dimensionAuthors: A. Ritz and R. Delbourgo

Comments: In the revised version, the results have been expressed in terms of

Bernoulli polynomials instead of generalized zeta functions; they agree forspinor QED with those of Schubert and Schmidt (obtained differently by pathintegral methods).Journal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys. A11 (1996) 253-270

The subject of low energy photon-photon scattering is considered in arbitrarydimensional space-time and the interaction is widened to include scatteringevents involving an arbitrary number of photons. The effective interactionLagrangian for these processes in QED has been determined in a manifestlyinvariant form. This generalisation resolves the structure of the weak-fieldEuler-Heisenberg Lagrangian and indicates that the component invariantfunctions have coefficients related, not only to the space-time dimension, butalso to the coefficients of the Bernoulli polynomial.
