Title: Physical Spectra in String Theories --- BRST Operators and Similarity

TransformationsComments: 15 pages, latex, no figures, Invited talk given at the "International

Symposium on BRS Symmetry" (Sep. 18--22, 1995, RIMS Kyoto)Several examples of similarity transformations connecting two string theorieswith different backgrounds are reviewed. We also discuss general structurebehind the similarity transformations from the point of view of the topologicalconformal algebra and of the non-linear realization of gauge symmetry.
