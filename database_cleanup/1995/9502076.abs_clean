Title: Hamiltonian Structures of Multi-component Constrained KP Hierarchy

Comments: 7 pages, Latex

We consider the Hamiltonian theory for the multi-component KP hierarchy. Weshow that the second Hamiltonian structures constructed by Sidorenko andStrampp[J. Math. Phys. {\bf 34}, 1429(1993)] are not Hamiltonian. A candidatefor the second Hamiltonian Structures is proposed and is proved to lead tohereditary operators.
