We propose a solution to the problem of compatibility of Bose-Fermistatistics with symmetry transformations implemented by compact quantum groupsof Drinfel'd type. We use unitary transformations to conjugate multi-particlesymmetry postulates, so as to obtain a twisted realization of the symmetricgroups S_n.
