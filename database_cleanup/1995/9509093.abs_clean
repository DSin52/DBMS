In this work a deep relation between topology and thermodynamical features ofmanifolds with boundaries is shown. The expression for the Eulercharacteristic, through the Gauss- Bonnet integral, and the one for the entropyof gravitational instantons are proposed in a form which makes the relationbetween them self-evident. A generalization of Bekenstein-Hawking formula, inwhich entropy and Euler characteristic are related in the form $S=\chi A/8$, isobtained. This formula reproduces the correct result for extreme black hole,where the Bekenstein-Hawking one fails ($S=0$ but $A \neq 0$). In such a way itrecovers a unified picture for the black hole entropy law. Moreover, it isproved that such a relation can be generalized to a wide class of manifoldswith boundaries which are described by spherically symmetric metrics (e.g.Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m, static de Sitter).
