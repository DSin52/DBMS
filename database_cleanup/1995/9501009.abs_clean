At the classical level we study open bosonic strings. A generic description ofstring self-interactions localized at string ends is given. Self-interactionsare characterized by two dimensionless coupling constants. The model isrewritten using complex Liouville fields. Using these Lorentz andreparametrization invariant variables, equations of motion get greatlysimplified and reduce to some boundary problem for Liouville equation.
