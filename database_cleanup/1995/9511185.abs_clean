We present an explicit construction for the central extension of the group$\Map(X, G)$ where $X$ is a compact manifold and $G$ is a Lie group. If $X$ isa complex curve we obtain a simple construction of the extension by the Picardvariety $\Pic(X)$. The construction is easily adapted to the extension of$\Aut(E)$, the gauge group of automorphisms of a nontrivial vector bundle $E$.
