Two-dimensional fermionic string theory is shown to have a structure oftopological model, which is isomorphic to a tensor product of two topologicalghost systems independent of each other. One of them is identified with $c=1$bosonic string theory while the other has trivial physical contents. This factenables us to regard two-dimensional fermionic string theory as an embedding of$c=1$ bosonic string theory in the moduli space of fermionic string theories.Upon this embedding, the discrete states of $c=1$ string theory are mapped tothose of fermionic string theory, which is considered to be the origin of thesimilarity between the physical spectra of these two theories. We also discussa novel BRST operator associated with this topological structure.
