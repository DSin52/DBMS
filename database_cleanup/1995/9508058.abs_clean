conferenceWe summarize results for all four-dimensional Bogomol'nyi-Sommerfield-Prasat(BPS) saturated and non-extreme solutions of the ($4+n$)-dimensional AbelianKaluza-Klein theory. Within effective $N=4$ supersymmetric string vacua,parameterized in terms of fields of the heterotic string on a six-torus, wethen present a class of BPS saturated states and the corresponding non-extremesolutions, specified by $O(6,22,Z)$ and $SL(2,Z)$ orbits of general dyoniccharge configurations with zero axion. The BPS saturated states withnon-negative $O(6,22,Z)$ norms for electric and magnetic charge vectors, alongwith the corresponding set of non-extreme solutions, are regular with non-zeromasses. BPS saturated states with the negative charge norms are singular,unaccompanied by non-extreme solutions and become massless at particular pointsof the moduli space. The role that such massless states may play in theenhancement of non-Abelian gauge symmetry as well as local supersymmetry isaddressed.
