The mean field like gauge invariant variational method formulated recently,is applied to a topologically massive QED in 3 dimensions. We find that thetheory has a phase transition in the Chern Simons coefficient $n$. The phasetransition is of the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz - Thouless type, and is triggered bythe liberation of Polyakov monopoles, which for $n>8$ are tightly bound intopairs. In our Hamiltonian approach this is seen as a similar behaviour of themagnetic vortices, which are present in the ground state wave functional of thecompact theory. For $n>8$, the low energy behavior of the theory is the same asin the noncompact case. For $n<8$ there are no propagating degrees of freedomon distance scales larger than the ultraviolet cutoff. The distinguishingproperty of the $n<8$ phase, is that the magnetic flux symmetry isspontaneoously broken.
