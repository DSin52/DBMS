We consider the soliton solutions in 1- and (1+1)-dimensional Toda latticemodels with a boundary. We make use of the solutions already known on a fullline by means of the Hirota's method. We explicitly construct the solutionssatisfying the boundary conditions. The ${\bf Z}_{\infty}$-symmetric boundarycondition can be introduced by the two-soliton solutions naturally.
