Title: Functional determinants on Moebius corners

Authors: J.S.Dowker

Comments: 11p,PlainTeX

A general method of finding functional determinants is presented that dependson the asymptotic behaviour of the resolvent. Its application to the case of abounded trihedral corner for which the eigenvalues are known only implicitly isoutlined and a generalisation of Barnes' product form of multiple gammafunctions is given
