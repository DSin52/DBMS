The nonlocal regularization method, recently proposed inref.\,\ct{emkw91,kw92,kw93}, is extended to general gauge theories byreformulating it along the ideas of the antibracket-antifield formalism. Fromthe interplay of both frameworks a fully regularized version of thefield-antifield (FA) formalism arises, being able to deal with higher orderloop corrections and to describe higher order loop contributions to the BRSTanomaly. The quantum master equation, considered in the FA framework as thequantity parametrizing BRST anomalies, is argued to be incomplete at two andhigher order loops and conjectured to reproduce only the one-loop correctionsto the $\hbar^p$ anomaly generated by the addition of $O(\hbar^{k})$, $k<p$,counterterms. Chiral $W_3$ gravity is used to exemplify the nonlocallyregularized FA formalism. First, the regularized one-loop quantum masterequation is used to compute the complete one-loop anomaly. Its two-loop order,however, is shown to reproduce only the modification to the two-loop anomalyproduced by the addition of a suitable one-loop counterterm, thereby providingan explicit verification of the previous statement for $p=2$. The well-knownuniversal two-loop anomaly, instead, is alternatively obtained from the BRSTvariation of the nonlocally regulated effective action. Incompleteness of thequantum master equation is thus concluded to be a consequence of a naivederivation of the FA BRST Ward identity.
