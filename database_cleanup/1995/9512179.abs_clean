We discuss the vacuum structure of $\phi^4$-theory in 1+1 dimensionsquantised on the light-front $x^+ =0$. To this end, one has to solve anon-linear, operator-valued constraint equation. It expresses that mode of thefield operator having longitudinal light-front momentum equal to zero, as afunction of all the other modes in the theory. We analyse whether this zeromode can lead to a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value of the field $\phi$and thus to spontaneous symmetry breaking. In perturbation theory, we get nosymmetry breaking. If we solve the constraint, however, non-perturbatively,state itself remains trivial, we find a non-vanishing vacuum expectation valueabove a critical coupling. Exactly the same result is obtained within alight-front Tamm-Dancoff approximation, if the renormalisation is done in thecorrect way.
