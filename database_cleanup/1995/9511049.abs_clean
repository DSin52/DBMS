We present an algebraic approach to string theory. An embedding of $sl(2|1)$in a super Lie algebra together with a grading on the Lie algebra determines anilpotent subalgebra of the super Lie algebra. Chirally gauging this subalgebrain the corresponding Wess-Zumino-Witten model, breaks the affine symmetry ofthe Wess-Zumino-Witten model to some extension of the $N=2$ superconformalalgebra. The extension is completely determined by the $sl(2|1)$ embedding. Therealization of the superconformal algebra is determined by the grading. For aparticular choice of grading, one obtains in this way, after twisting, the BRSTstructure of a string theory. We classify all embeddings of $sl(2|1)$ into Liesuper algebras and give a detailed account of the branching of the adjointrepresentation. This provides an exhaustive classification and characterizationof both all extended $N=2$ superconformal algebras and all string theorieswhich can be obtained in this way.
