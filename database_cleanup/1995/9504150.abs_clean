Physical mass spectra of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in 1+1 dimensionsare evaluated in the light-cone gauge with a compact spatial dimension. Thesupercharges are constructed and the infrared regularization is unambiguouslyprescribed for supercharges, instead of the light-cone Hamiltonian. Thisprovides a manifestly supersymmetric infrared regularization for thediscretized light-cone approach. By an exact diagonalization of the superchargematrix between up to several hundred color singlet bound states, we find arapidly increasing density of states as mass increases.
