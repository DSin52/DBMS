Title: On T-Duality and Supersymmetry

Comments: To appear in the proceedings of the Conference on Gauge Theories,

Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum Gravity, Leuven, 10-14 July 1995Journal-ref: Leuven Notes in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics, Series B

Vol. 6, 139-148The interplay between T-duality and supersymmetry in string theory isexplored. It is shown that T-duality is always compatible with supersymmetryand simply changes a local realization to a non-local one and vice versa.Non-local realizations become natural using classical parafermions of theunderlying conformal field theory. Examples presented include hyper-kahlermetrics and the backgrounds for the SU(2) X U(1) and SU(2)/U(1) X U(1) X U(1)exact conformal field theories.
