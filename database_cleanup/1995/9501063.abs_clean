For any given algebra of local observables in Minkowski space an associatedscaling algebra is constructed on which renormalization group (scaling)transformations act in a canonical manner. The method can be carried over toarbitrary spacetime manifolds and provides a framework for the systematicanalysis of the short distance properties of local quantum field theories. Itis shown that every theory has a (possibly non-unique) scaling limit which canbe classified according to its classical or quantum nature. Dilation invarianttheories are stable under the action of the renormalization group. Within thisframework the problem of wedge (Bisognano-Wichmann) duality in the scalinglimit is discussed and some of its physical implications are outlined.
