The overlap formulation is applied to calculate the chiral determinant on atwo-dimensional torus with twisted boundary conditions. We evaluate first thecontinuum overlap, which is convergent and well-defined, and yields the correctstring theory result for both the real and imaginary parts of the effectiveaction. We then show that the lattice version of the overlap gives thecontinuum overlap results in the limit when the lattice spacing tends to zero,and that the subleading terms in that limit are irrelevant.
