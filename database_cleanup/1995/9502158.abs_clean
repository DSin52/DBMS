The usual prescription for constructing gauge-invariant Lagrangian isgeneralized to the case where a Lagrangian contains second derivatives offields as well as first derivatives. Symmetric tensor fields in addition to theusual vector fields are introduced as gauge fields. Covariant derivatives andgauge-field strengths are determined.
