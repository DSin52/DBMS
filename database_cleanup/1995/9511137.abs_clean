Title: Anyons as spin particles

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX; Talk given at the Conference ``Theories of

Fundamental Interactions", Maynooth, Ireland, May 1995; to be published in``Topics in Quantum Field Theory" (World Scientific, Ed. T. Thcrakian, 1995)(2+1)-dimensional relativistic fractional spin particles are consideredwithin the framework of the group-theoretical approach to anyons starting fromthe level of classical mechanics and concluding by the construction of theminimal set of linear differential field equations.
