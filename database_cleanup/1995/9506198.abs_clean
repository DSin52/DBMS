The quantum affine symmetry of the sine-Gordon theory at q^2 = 1, whichoccurs at the reflectionless points, is studied. Conserved currents thatcorrespond to the closure of simple root generators are considered, and shownto be local. We argue that they satisfy the affine sl(2) algebra. Examples ofthese currents are explicitly constructed.
