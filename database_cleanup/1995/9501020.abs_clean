Infrared regularized versions of 4-D N=1 superstring ground states areconstructed by curving the spacetime. A similar regularization can be performedin field theory. For the IR regularized string ground states we derive theexact one-loop effective action for non-zero U(1) or chromo-magnetic fields aswell as gravitational and axionic-dilatonic fields. This effective action is IRand UV finite. Thus, the one-loop corrections to all couplings (gravitational,gauge and Yukawas) are unabiguously computed. These corrections are necessaryfor quantitative string superunification predictions at low energies. Theone-loop corrections to the couplings are also found to satisfy Infrared FlowEquations.
