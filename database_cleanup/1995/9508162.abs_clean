Seiberg-Witten InvariantsAuthors: Seungjoon Hyun, Jaemo Park and Jae-Suk Park

Comments: 53 pages, harvmac, no figures; Revised version (Some typos and

expressions are corrected.)GeometryWe study the path integral of a twisted $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory coupled with hypermultiplet having the bare mass. We explicitly computethe topological correlation functions for the $SU(2)$ theory on a compactoriented simply connected simple type Riemann manifold with $b_2^+ \geq 3$. Asthe corollaries, we determine the topological correlation functions of thetheory without the bare mass and those of the theory without coupling to thehypermultiplet. This includes a concrete field theoretic proof of the relationbetween the Donaldson and the Seiberg-Witten invariants.
