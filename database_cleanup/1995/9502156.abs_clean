We present a unified point of view on the different methods available in theliterature to extract gauge theory renormalization constants from thelow-energy limit of string theory. The Bern-Kosower method, based on anoff-shell continuation of string theory amplitudes, and the construction oflow-energy string theory effective actions for gauge particles, can both beunderstood in terms of strings interacting with background gauge fields, andthus reproduce, in the low-energy limit, the field theory results of thebackground field method. We present in particular a consistent off-shellcontinuation of the one-loop gluon amplitudes in the open bosonic string thatreproduces exactly the results of the background field method in the Feynmangauge.
