Title: Partition Function of a Quadratic Functional and Semiclassical

Approximation for Witten's 3-Manifold InvariantAuthors: David H. Adams and Siddhartha Sen

Comments: Some typo's are corrected. One of these which may have caused

confusion is in the chain of maps at the top of page 22 (or bottom of page 21in the first version), where --Gamma1--T1--Gamma--T1*--Gamma1-- should havebeen --Gamma1--T1--Gamma--T--Gamma--T1*--Gamma1--. (latex, 56p.)An extension of the method and results of A. Schwarz for evaluating thepartition function of a quadratic functional is presented. This enables thepartition functions to be evaluated for a wide class of quadratic functionalsof interest in topological quantum field theory, for which no other method haspreviously been available. In particular it enables the partition functionsappearing in the semiclassical approximation for the Witten-invariant to beevaluated in the most general case. The resulting k-dependence is preciselythat conjectured by D. Freed and R. Gompf.
