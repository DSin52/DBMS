We investigate the effect of gravitational back-reaction on the black holeevaporation process. The standard derivation of Hawking radiation isre-examined and extended by including gravitational interactions between theinfalling matter and the outgoing radiation. We find that these interactionslead to substantial effects. In particular, as seen by an outside observer,they lead to a fast growing uncertainty in the position of the infalling matteras it approaches the horizon. We argue that this result supports the idea ofblack hole complementarity, which states that, in the description of the blackhole system appropriate to outside observers, the region behind the horizondoes not establish itself as a classical region of space-time. We also give anew formulation of this complementarity principle, which does not make anyspecific reference to the location of the black hole horizon.
