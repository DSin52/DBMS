We present evidence for renormalization group fixed points with dual magneticdescriptions in fourteen new classes of four-dimensional $N=1$ supersymmetricmodels. Nine of these classes are chiral and many involve two or three gaugegroups. These theories are generalizations of models presented earlier bySeiberg, by Kutasov and Schwimmer, and by the present authors. The differentclasses are interrelated; one can flow from one class to another usingconfinement or symmetry breaking.
