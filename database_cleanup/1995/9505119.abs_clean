We explicitly construct the metric and torsion couplings of two-dimensional(4,0)-super\-sym\-metric sigma models with target space a four-manifold thatare invariant under a $U(1)$ symmetry generated by a tri-holomorphic Killingvector field that leaves in addition the torsion invariant. We show that themetric couplings arise from magnetic monopoles on the three-sphere which is thespace of orbits of the group action generated by the tri-holomorphic Killingvector field on the sigma model target manifold. We also examine the globalstructure of a subclass of these metrics that are in addition $SO(3)$-invariantand find that the only non-singular one, for models with non-zero torsion, isthat of $SU(2)\times U(1)$ WZW model.
