TrialityComments: 13 pages, uses harvmac, to appear in the Proc. of Strings 95

We discuss the phases of four dimensional gauge theories and demonstrate themin solvable examples. Some of our simple examples exhibit confinement andoblique confinement. The theory has dual magnetic and dual dyonic descriptionsin which these phenomena happen at weak coupling. Combined with the underlyingelectric theory, which gives a weak coupling description of the Higgs phase, wehave electric-magnetic-dyonic triality. In an appendix we clarify some pointsregarding the use of 1PI superpotentials in these theories.
