We study symmetry breaking in the static coordinate-system of de Sitter space.This is done with the help of the functional-Schr\"odinger approach used inprevious calculations by Ratra [1]. We consider a massless, minimally coupledscalar field as the parameter of a continuous symmetry (the angular componentof an O(2) symmetry). Then we study the correlation function of the masslessscalar field, to derive the correlation function of the original field, whichfinally shows the restoration of the continuous symmetry.
