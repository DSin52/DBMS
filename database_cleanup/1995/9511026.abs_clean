Spectrum of elementary string states in type II string theory compactified ona torus contains short multiplets which are invariant under only one quarter ofthe space-time supersymmetry generators. $U$-duality transformation convertsthese states into bound states of Dirichlet branes which wrap aroundintersecting cycles of the internal torus. We study a class of these boundstates that are dual to the elementary string states at the first excitedlevel, and argue that the degeneracy of these bound states is in agreement withthe $U$-duality prediction.
