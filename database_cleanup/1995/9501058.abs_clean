We calculate correlation functions in matrix models modified by trace-squaredterms. First we study scaling operators in modified one-matrix models and findthat their correlation functions satisfy modified Virasoro constraints. Then weturn to dressed order parameters in minimal models and show that theircorrelators satisfy Goulian-Li formulae continued to negative Liouvilledressing exponents. Our calculations provide additional support for the ideathat the modified matrix models contain operators with the negative branch ofgravitational dressing.
