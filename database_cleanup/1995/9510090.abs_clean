The Schwinger model (QED_2) with N flavors of massive fermions on a circle ofcircumference L, or equivalently at finite temperature T, is reduced to aquantum mechanical system of N-1 degrees of freedom. With degenerate fermionmasses (m) the chiral condensate develops a cusp singularity at $\theta=\pm\pi$ in the limit L -> $\infty$ or T -> 0, which is removed by a largeasymmetry in the fermion masses. Physical quantities sensitively depend on theparameter mL or m/T, and the m -> 0 and L -> $\infty$ (or T -> 0) limits do notcommute. A detailed analysis is given for N=3.
