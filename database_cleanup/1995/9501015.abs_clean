Unlike Einstein gravity, dilaton-Maxwell gravity with matter is renormalizablein $2+\epsilon$ dimensions and has a smooth $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ limit.Byperforming a renormalization- group study of this last theory we show that thegravitational coupling constant $G$ has a non-trivial,ultraviolet stable fixedpoint (asymptotic freedom) and that the dilatonic coupling functions (includingthe dilatonic potential) exhibit also a real, non-trivial fixed point. At suchpoint the theory represents a standard charged string-inspired model.Stabilityand the gauge dependence of the fixed-point solution is discussed.It is shownthat all these properties remain valid in a dilatonic-Yang-Mills theory with$n$ scalars and $m$ spinors, that has the UF stable fixed point $G^* =3\epsilon (48+12N-m-2n)^{-1}$.In addition, it is seen that by increasing $N$(number of gauge fields) the matter central charge $C=n+m/2$ ($0<C<24+6N$) canbe increased correspondingly ( in pure dilatonic gravity $0<C<24$).
