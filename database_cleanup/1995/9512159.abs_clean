Journal-ref: International Journal of Theoretical Physics IJTP

VOL.39,No.4,(2000)We investigate the internal space of Bessel functions which is associated tothe group Z of positive and negative integers defining their orders. As aresult we propose and prove a new unifying formula (to be added to the hugeliterature on Bessel functions) generating Bessel functions of real orders outof integer order one's. The unifying formula is expected to be of great use inapplied mathematics. Some applications of the formula are given forillustration.
