In recent works by Singer, Douglas and Gopakumar and Gross an application ofresults of Voiculescu from non-commutative probability theory to constructionsof the master field for large $N$ matrix field theories have been suggested. Inthis note we consider interrelations between the master field and quantumgroups. We define the master field algebra and observe that it is isomorphic tothe algebra of functions on the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ for $q=0$. The masterfield becomes a central element of the quantum group Hopf algebra. The quantumHaar measure on the $SU_q(2)$ for any $q$ gives the Wigner semicircledistribution for the master field. Coherent states on $SU_q(2)$ become coherentstates in the master field theory.
