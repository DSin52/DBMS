Title: The String Equation and Solitons

Comments: 9 pages, Based on lectures delivered at the Erice Chalonge School,

`String Gravity and Physics at the Planck Scale', 8-19 September 1995We present a brief survey of the results of the Theory of Solitons from theviewpoint of the periodic theory including some new results in the theory ofSolitons and Algebraic Geometry, The Theory of Solitons and the Stringequation, Topologically trivial and nontrivial periodic two-dimensionalSchrodinger operators and Riemann surfaces and Cyclic and semicyclic chains ofLaplace transformations (new results of the present author and A.Veselov).
