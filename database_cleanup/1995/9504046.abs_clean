Recently we have shown that a phase transition occurs in the leadingapproximation of the large N limit in rigid strings coupled to long rangeKalb-Ramond interactions. The disordered phase is essentially theNambu-Goto-Polyakov string theory while the ordered phase is a new theory. Inthis part II letter we study the first sub-leading quantum corrections westarted in I. We derive the renormalized mass gap equation and obtain therenormalized critical line of the interacting theory. Our main and final resultis that the phase transition does indeed survive quantum fluctuations.
