Non-perturbative instanton corrections to the moduli space geometry of typeIIA string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau space are derived and found tocontain order $e^{-1/g_s}$ contributions, where $g_s$ is the string coupling.The computation reduces to a weighted sum of supersymmetric extremal maps ofstrings, membranes and fivebranes into the Calabi-Yau space, all three of whichenter on equal footing. It is shown that a supersymmetric 3-cycle is one forwhich the pullback of the K\"ahler form vanishes and the pullback of theholomorphic three-form is a constant multiple of the volume element. Quantummirror symmetry relates the sum in the IIA theory over supersymmetric,odd-dimensional cycles in the Calabi-Yau space to a sum in the IIB theory oversupersymmetric, even-dimensional cycles in the mirror.
