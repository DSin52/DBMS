The master fields for the large $N$ limit of matrix models and gauge theoryare constructed. The master fields satisfy to standard equations ofrelativistic field theory but fields are quantized according to a new rule. Todefine the master field we use the Yang-Feldman equation with a free fieldquantized in the Boltzmannian Fock space. The master field for gauge theorydoes not take values in a finite-dimensional Lie algebra however there is anon-Abelian gauge symmetry. For the construction of the master field it isessential to work in Minkowski space-time and to use the Wightman correlationfunctions. The BRST quantization of the master field for gauge theory and aloop equation are considered.
