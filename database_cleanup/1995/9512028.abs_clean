We analyze the interaction between the massless RR states with a dilaton in atype IIB superstring. By constructing vertex operators for massless and massiveRR states and computing their correlation functions with a dilaton we find theRamond-Ramond part of the superstring low-energy effective action. The RR termsappearing in the action do not contain the standard dilatonic factor (stringcoupling constant). The geometrical interpretation of this fact ispresented. Namely we argue that the spin operators in the RR verticeseffectively decrease the Euler character of the worldsheet by 1 unit. As aresult, the additional dilatonic term proportional to string coupling constantappears in the worldsheet string action.
