Title: The equations of some dispersionless limit

Comments: AmSTeX, 6 pages, amsppt.sty

This short article presents a table of new equations which can be regarded asthe generalized equations of the dispersionless limit of several nonlinearequations. From the definition expressed in an algebraic formula, one can getan equation for any positive numbers p and q. The equations were calculated byusing the computers and were examined by hand-calculation up to p=10. Relationswith some dispersionless hierarchies are mentioned.
