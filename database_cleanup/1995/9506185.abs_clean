Maynooth (Ireland), May 1995. (LaTeX file)Relevant physical models are described by singular Lagrangians, so that theirHamiltonian description is based on the Dirac theory of constraints. Thequalitative aspects of this theory are now understood, in particular the roleof the Shanmugadhasan canonical transformation in the determination of acanonical basis of Dirac's observables allowing the elimination of gaugedegrees of freedom from the classical description of physical systems. Thisprogramme was initiated by Dirac for the electromagnetic field with chargedfermions. Now Dirac's observables for Yang-Mills theory with fermions (whosetypical application is QCD) have been found in suitable function spaces wherethe Gribov ambiguity is absent. Also the ones for the Abelian Higgs model areknown and those for the $SU(2) \times U(1)$ electroweak theory with fermionsare going to be found with the same method working for the Abelian case. Themain task along these lines will now be the search of Dirac's observables fortetrad gravity in the case of asymptotically flat 3-manifolds. The philosophysymplectic separation of the physical variables from the gauge ones so that therole of differential geometry applied to smooth field configurations isdominating, in contrast with the standard approach of ``first quantizing, thenreducing", where, in the case of gauge field theory, the reduction processtakes place on distributional field configurations, which dominate in quantummeasures. This global separation has been accomplished till now, at least at aheuristic level, and one is going to have a classical (pseudoclassical for thefermion) variables basis for the physical description of the $SU(3)\timesSU(2)\times U(1)$ standard model; instead, with tetrad gravity one expects to
