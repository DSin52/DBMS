The $e^-$-$e^+$ bound state spectrum of QED3 is investigated in the quenchedladder approximation to the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation with fermionpropagators from a rainbow approximation Schwinger-Dyson equation. A detailedanalysis of the analytic structure of the fermion propagator is performed so asto test the appropriateness of the methods employed. The large fermion masslimit of the Bethe-Salpeter equation is also considered, including a derivationof the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, and comparisons made with existingnon-relativistic calculations.
