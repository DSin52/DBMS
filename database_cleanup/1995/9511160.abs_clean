An extended free fermionic construction of the internal N=1 world sheetsupercurrent for four-dimensional superstring theory is given. We show how itcan describe theories with massless fermions, and we discuss the correspondingN=2 superconformal algebra. As an intermediate step, we show that an internalN=2 global superconformal invariance occurs in any superstring theory withmassless fermions at tree level. To demonstrate this fact, we give the N=2supercurrents for a model with N=1 space-time supersymmetry and a model withoutspace-time supersymmetry.
