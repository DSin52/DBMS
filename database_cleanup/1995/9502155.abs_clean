We discuss the status of the black hole entropy formula $S_{\rm BH} = A_H/4G$ in low energy effective field theory. The low energy expansion of thedecay of hot flat space by black hole nucleation. In this context the entropycan be defined as an enhancement factor in the semiclassical decay rate, whichis dominated by a sphaleron-like saddle point. We find that all perturbativedivergences appearing in Euclidean calculations of the entropy can berenormalized in low energy couplings. We also discuss some formal aspects ofthe relation between the Euclidean and Hamiltonian approaches to the one loopcorrections to black hole entropy and geometric entropy, and we emphasize thevirtues of the use of covariant regularization prescriptions. In fact, thedefinition of black hole entropy in terms of decay rates {\it requires} the useof covariant measures and accordingly, covariant regularizations in pathintegrals. Finally, we speculate on the possibility that low energy effectivefield theory could be sufficient to understand the microscopic degrees offreedom underlying black hole entropy. We propose a qualitative physicalpicture in which black hole entropy refers to a space of quasi-coherent statesof infalling matter, together with its gravitational field. We stress that thisscenario might provide a low energy explanation of both the black hole entropyand the information puzzle.
