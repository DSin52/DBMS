An explicit orbifold example of the non-zero correlation functions related tothe additional contribution to the induced mass term for Higgs particles at lowenergies is given. We verify that they form finite dimensional representationsof the target space modular transformation $SL_2(Z)$. This action of themodular group is shown to be consistent with its action on the fixed points setdefining the twisted fields.
