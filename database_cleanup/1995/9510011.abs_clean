A non--commutative analogue of the classical differential forms isconstructed on the phase--space of an arbitrary quantum system. Thenon--commutative forms are universal and are related to the quantum mechanicaldynamics in the same way as the classical forms are related to classicaldynamics.They are constructed by applying the Weyl--Wigner symbol map to thedifferential envelope of the linear operators on the quantum mechanical Hilbertspace. This leads to a representation of the non--commutative forms consideredby A.~Connes in terms of multiscalar functions on the classical phase--space.In an appropriate coincidence limit they define a quantum deformation of theclassical tensor fields and both commutative and non--commutative forms can bestudied in a unified framework. We interprete the quantum differential forms inphysical terms and comment on possible applications.
