We consider correlation functions of operators and the operator productexpansion in two-dimensional quantum gravity. First we introduce correlationfunctions with geodesic distances between operators kept fixed. Next by makingtwo of the operators closer, we examine if there exists an analog of theoperator product expansion in ordinary field theories. Our results suggest thatthe operator product expansion holds in quantum gravity as well, though specialcare should be taken regarding the physical meaning of fixing geodesicdistances on a fluctuating geometry.
