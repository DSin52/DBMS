We show that the kinetic approach to statistical mechanics permits an elegantand efficient treatment of fractional exclusion statistics. By using theexclusion-inclusion principle recently proposed [Phys. Rev. E49, 5103 (1994)]as a generalization of the Pauli exclusion principle, which is based on aproper definition of the transition probability between two states, we derive avariety of different statistical distributions interpolating between bosons andfermions. The Haldane exclusion principle and the Haldane-Wu fractionalexclusion statistics are obtained in a natural way as particular cases. Thethermodynamic properties of the statistical systems obeying the generalizedexclusion-inclusion principle are discussed.
