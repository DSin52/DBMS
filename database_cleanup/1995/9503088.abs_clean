We study bosonization of the sine-Gordon theory in the presence of boundaryinteractions at the free fermion point. In this way we obtain the boundaryS-matrix as a function of physical parameters in the boundary sine-GordonLagrangian. The boundary S-matrix can be matched onto the solution of Ghoshaland Zamolodchikov, thereby relating the formal parameters in the lattersolution to the physical parameters in the lagrangian.
