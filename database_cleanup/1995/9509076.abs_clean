We classify the spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-MaxwellDilaton field equations in D dimensions and find some exact solutions of thestring theory at all orders of the string tension parameter. We also show theuniqueness of the black hole solutions of this theory in static axiallysymmetric spacetimes.
