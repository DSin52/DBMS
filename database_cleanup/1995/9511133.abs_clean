The radiation from the black holes of a 1+1-dimensional chiral quantumgravity model is studied. Most notably, a non-trivial dependence on arenormalization parameter that characterizes the anomaly relations is uncoveredin an improved semiclassical approximation scheme; this dependence is notpresent in the naive semiclassical approximation.
