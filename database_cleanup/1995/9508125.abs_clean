Title: The structure of the ground ring in critical $W_3$ gravity

Authors: Chuan-Jie Zhu

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX (elsart)

By explicit calculation, I determine the structure of the ground ring of thecritical $W_3$ gravity and show that there is an $su(3)$ invariant quadraticrelation among the six basic elements. By using this result, I also constructsome discrete physical states of the critical $W_3$ gravity.
