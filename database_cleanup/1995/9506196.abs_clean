We begin an investigation of supersymmetric theories based on exceptionalgroups. The flat directions are most easily parameterized using theircorrespondence with gauge invariant polynomials. Symmetries and holomorphytightly constrain the superpotentials, but due to multiple gauge invariantsother techniques are needed for their full determination. We give an explicittreatment of $G_2$ and find gaugino condensation for $N_f\leq 2$, and aninstanton generated superpotential for $N_f=3$. The analogy with $SU(N_c)$gauge theories continues with modified and unmodified quantum moduli spaces for$N_f=4$ and $N_f=5$ respectively, and a non-Abelian Coulomb phase for$N_f\geq6$. Electric variables suffice to describe this phase over the fullrange of $N_f$. The appendix gives a self-contained introduction to $G_2$ andits invariant tensors.
