The dynamical behaviour of domain boundaries between different realizations ofthe vacuum of scalar fields with spontaneously broken phases is investigated.They correspond to zero-modes of the Goldstone fields, moving with the speed oflight, and turn out to be accompanied by strongly oscillating gravitationalfields. In certain space-time topologies this leads to a quantization conditionfor the symmetry breaking scale in terms of the Planck mass.
