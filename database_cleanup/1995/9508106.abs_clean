The ($p=2$) parabose-parafermi supersymmetry is studied in general terms. Itis shown that the algebraic structure of the ($p=2$) parastatistical dynamicalvariables allows for (symmetry) transformations which mix the parabose andparafermi coordinate variables. The example of a simple parabose-parafermioscillator is discussed and its symmetries investigated. It turns out that thisoscillator possesses two parabose- -parafermi supersymmetries. The combined setof generators of the symmetries forms the algebra of supersymmetric quantummechanics supplemented with an additional central charge. In this sense thereis no relation between the parabose-parafermi supersymmetry and theparasupersymmetric quantum mechanics. A precise definition of a quantum systeminvolving this type of parabose- parafermi supersymmetry is offered, thusintroducing ($p=2$) Supersymmetric Paraquantum Mechanics. The spectrumdegeneracy structure of general ($p=2$) supersymmetric paraquantum mechanics isanalyzed in detail. The energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors for theparabose-parafermi oscillator are then obtained explicitly. The latter confirmsthe validity of the results obtained for general supersymmetric paraquantummechanics.
