Title: Relation between space-time inversion and particle-antiparticle symmetry

and the microscopic essence of special relativityAuthors: Guang-jiong Ni and Su-qing Chen (Fudan University, Shanghai, China and

After analyzing the implication of investigations on the C, P and Ttransformations since 1956, we propose that there is a basic symmetry inparticle physics. The combined space-time inversion is equivalent toparticle-antiparticle transformation, denoted by ${\cal PT=C}$. It is shownthat the relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory do containthis invariance explicitly or implicitly. In particular, (a) the appearance ofnegative energy or negative probability density in single particle theory --corresponding to the fact of existence of antiparticle, (b) spin- statisticsconnection, (c) CPT theorem, (d) the Feynman propagator are linked together viathis symmetry. Furthermore, we try to derive the main results of specialrelativity, especially, (e) the mass-energy relation, (f) the Lorentztransformation by this one ``relativistic'' postulate and some``nonrelativistic'' knowledge.
