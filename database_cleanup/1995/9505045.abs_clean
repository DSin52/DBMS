A class of 4-dimensional supersymmetric dyonic black hole solutions thatarise in an effective 11-dimensional supergravity compactified on a 7-torus ispresented. We give the explicit form of dyonic solutions with diagonal internalmetric, associated with the Kaluza-Klein sector as well as the three-formfield, and relate them to a class of solutions with a general internal metricby imposing a subset of $SO(7)\subset E_7$ transformations. We also give thefield transformations which relate the above configurations to 4-dimensionalground state configurations of Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarzsector of type-IIA strings on a 6-torus.
