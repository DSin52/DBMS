We formulate QCD in (d+1) dimensions using Dirac's front form with periodicboundary conditions, that is, within Discretized Light-Cone Quantization. Theformalism is worked out in detail for SU(2) pure glue theory in (2+1)dimensions which is approximated by restriction to the lowest {\it transverse}momentum gluons. The dimensionally-reduced theory turns out to be SU(2) gaugetheory coupled to adjoint scalar matter in (1+1) dimensions. The scalar fieldis the remnant of the transverse gluon. This field has modes of both non-zeroand zero {\it longitudinal} momentum. We categorize the types of zero modesthat occur into three classes, dynamical, topological, and constrained, eachwell known in separate contexts. The equation for the constrained mode isexplicitly worked out. The Gauss law is rather simply resolved to extractphysical, namely color singlet states. The topological gauge mode is treatedaccording to two alternative scenarios related to the In the one, a spectrum isfound consistent with pure SU(2) gluons in (1+1) dimensions. In the other, thegauge mode excitations are estimated and their role in the spectrum withgenuine Fock excitations is explored. A color singlet state is given whichsatisfies Gauss' law. Its invariant mass is estimated and discussed in thephysical limit.
