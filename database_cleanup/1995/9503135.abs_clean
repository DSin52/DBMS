Title: QUANTUM DISSIPATION AND COHERENCE

Comments: Invited talk at the Workshop on Quantum-like models and coherent

effects, Erice, Sicily, 13-20 June 1994.We discuss dissipative systems in Quantum Field Theory by studying thecanonical quantization of the damped harmonic oscillator (dho). We show thatthe set of states of the system splits into unitarily inequivalentrepresentations of the canonical commutation relations. The irreversibility oftime evolution is expressed as tunneling among the unitarily inequivalentrepresentations. Canonical quantization is shown to lead to time dependentSU(1,1) coherent states. We derive the exact action for the dho from the pathintegral formulation of the quantum Brownian motion developed by Schwinger andby Feynman and Vernon. The doubling of the phase-space degrees of freedom fordissipative systems is related to quantum noise effects. Finally, we expressthe time evolution generator of the dho in terms of operators of the$q$-deformation of the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra. The $q$-parameter acts as alabel for the unitarily inequivalent representations.
