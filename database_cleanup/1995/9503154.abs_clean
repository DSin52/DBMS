We explicitly obtain the generalization of the Ehlers transformation forstationary axisymmetric Einstein equations to string theory. This isaccomplished by finding the twist potential corresponding to the moduli fieldsin the effective two dimensional theory. Twist potential and symmetric moduliare shown to transform under an $O(d,d)$ which is a manifest symmetry of theequations of motion. The non-trivial action of this $O(d,d)$ is given by theEhlers transformation and belongs to the set $O(d) \times O(d)\over O(d) $.
