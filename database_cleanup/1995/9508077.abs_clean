We adapt a calculation due to Massacand and Schmid to the coordinateindependent definition of time and vacuum given by Capri and Roy in order tocompute the trace anomaly for a massless scalar field in a curved spacetime in1+1 dimensions. The computation which requires only a simple regulator andnormal ordering yields the well-known result $\frac{R}{24\pi}$ in astraightforward manner.
