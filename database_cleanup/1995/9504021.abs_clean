General static solutions for a massless scalar field coupled to a class ofeffectively 2-d gravity theories continuously connecting spherically symmetric$d$-dimensional Einstein gravity ($d >3$) and the CGHS model are analyticallyobtained. They include black holes and point scalar charge solutions with nakedsingularities, and are used to give an analytic proof of no-hair theorem. Exactscattering solutions in $s$-wave 4-d Einstein gravity are constructed as ageneralization of corresponding static solutions. They show the existence ofblack hole formation threshold for square pulse type incoming stress-energyflux, above which trapped surfaces are dynamically formed. The relationshipbetween this behavior and the numerically studied phase transition in thissystem \cite{choptuik} is discussed.
