We study in detail the space of perturbations of a pair of dual $N=1$supersymmetric theories based on an $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with an adjoint $X$and fundamentals with a superpotential which is polynomial in $X$. Theequivalence between them depends on non-trivial facts about polynomialequations, i.e.\ singularity theory. The classical chiral rings of the twotheories are different. Quantum mechanically there are new relations in thechiral rings which ensure their equivalence. Duality interchanges ``trivial''classical relations in one theory with quantum relations in the other and viceversa. We also speculate about the behavior of the theory without thesuperpotential.
