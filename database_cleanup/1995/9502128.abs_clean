A model for planar phenomena introduced by Jackiw and Pi and described by aLagrangian including a Chern-Simons term is considered. The associatedequations of motion, among which a 2+1 gauged nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation,are rewritten into a gauge independent form involving the modulus of the matterfield. Application of a Painlev\'e analysis, as adapted to partial differentialequations by Weiss, Tabor and Carnevale, shows up resonance values that are allinteger. However, compatibility conditions need be considered which cannot besatisfied consistently in general. Such a result suggests that the examinedequations are not integrable, but provides tools for the investigation of theintegrability of different reductions. This in particular puts forward thefamiliar integrable Liouville and 1+1 nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations.
