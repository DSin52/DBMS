Target space duality symmetries, which acts on K\"ahler and continuous Wilsonline moduli, of a ${\bf Z}_N$ ($N\not=2$) 2-dimensional subspace of the modulispace of orbifold compactification are modified to include twisted moduli.These spaces described by the cosets $SU(n,1)\over SU(n)\times U(1)$ are$special$ K\"ahler, a fact which is exploited in deriving the extension of treelevel duality transformation to include higher orders of the twisted moduli.Also, restrictions on these higher order terms are derived.
