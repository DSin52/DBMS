We compute the spectrum of scalar and tensor metric perturbations generated,as amplified vacuum fluctuations, during an epoch of dilaton-driven inflationof the type occurring naturally in string cosmology. In the tensor case thecomputation is straightforward while, in the scalar case, it is made delicateby the appearance of a growing mode in the familiar longitudinal gauge. Inspite of this, a reliable perturbative calculation of perturbations far outsidethe horizon can be performed by resorting either to appropriate gauge invariantvariables, or to a new coordinate system in which the growing mode can be"gauged down". The simple outcome of this complicated analysis is that bothscalar and tensor perturbations exhibit nearly Planckian spectra, whose common"temperature" is related to some very basic parameters of the string-cosmologybackground.
