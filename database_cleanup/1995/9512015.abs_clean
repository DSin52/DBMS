Considering the conformal anomaly in an effective action, the criticaldimension of string theory can be decided in the harmonic gauge, in which ithad been reported before to be indefinite. In this gauge, there is no anomalyfor the ghost number symmetry. This can be naturally understood in terms ofFaddeev-Popov conjugation in the theory.
