We present a dual formulation of the construction of N=2 nonlinear sigma-modeltype conformal field theories with c=9 which are mainly used as internalsectors of Calabi-Yau heterotic string compactifications. The supercurrents andthe higher components of the spectral flow superfields turn out in each case tobe tensor products of two simple currents of a c=1 and a non-supersymmetricparafermionic c=8 CFT. The characters of the latter model can be regarded asstring functions of the coset sigma/U(1). In particular, for the (1)^9 Gepnermodel we discuss these string functions in detail, realizing this modelcontains a broken E_8 gauge symmetry of which only the abelian subalgebraremains a symmetry of the spectrum. As an example, we construct a simple modelleading to a string theory with a massless spectrum of 36 E_6 generations andan extended gauge symmetry E_6 x SU(3)^4.
