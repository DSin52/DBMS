We investigate the Chung-Fukuma-Shapere theory, or Kuperberg theory, ofthree-dimensional lattice topological field theory. We construct a functorwhich satisfies the Atiyah's axioms of topological quantum field theory byreformulating the theory as Turaev-Viro type state-sum theory on a triangulatedmanifold. The theory can also be extended to give a topological invariant ofmanifolds with boundary.
