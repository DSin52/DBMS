We define the Bondi energy for two-dimensional dilatonic gravity theories bygeneralizing the known expression of the ADM energy. We show that ourdefinition of the Bondi energy is exactly the ADM energy minus the radiationenergy at null infinity. An explicit calculation is done for the evaporatingblack hole in the RST model with the Strominger's ghost decoupling term. It isshown that the infalling matter energy is completely recovered through theHawking radiation and the thunderpop.
