The zeta function associated with higher-spin fields on the Euclidean$4$-ball is investigated. The leading coefficients of the correspondingheat-kernel expansion are given explicitly and the zeta functional determinantis calculated. For fermionic fields the determinant is shown to differ forlocal and spectral boundary conditions.
