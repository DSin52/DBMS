It was previously shown that most of the superstrings can be obtained fromthose with higher world-sheet supersymmetry as spontaneously broken phases. Inthis paper, we show that the small $N=4$ superstring, which was left out ofthis hierarchy of the universal string, can be obtained from the large $N=4$strings. We also show that the $N=2$ string is a special vacuum of small $N=4$string. Thus all the known superstring theories can be derived from a universalstring by spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry.
