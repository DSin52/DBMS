We present the exact effective superpotentials in $4d$, $N=1$ supersymmetric$SU(2)$ gauge theories with $N_3$ triplets and $N_2$ doublets of mattersuperfields. For the theories with a single triplet matter superfield wepresent the exact gauge couplings for arbitrary bare masses and Yukawacouplings.
