We consider an internal space of two discrete points in the fifth dimensionof the Kaluza-Klein theory by using the formalism of noncommutative geometrydeveloped in a previous paper \cite{VIWA} of a spacetime supplemented by twodiscrete points. With the nonvanishing internal torsion 2-form there are noconstraints implied on the vielbeins. The theory contains a pair of tensor, apair of vector and a pair of scalar fields. Using the generalized Cartanstructure equation we are able not only to determine uniquely the hermitian andmetric compatible connection 1-forms, but also the nonvanishing internaltorsion 2-form in terms of vielbeins. The resulting action has a rich andcomplex structure, a particular feature being the existence of massive modes.Thus the nonvanishing internal torsion generates a Kaluza-Klein type model withzero and massive modes.
