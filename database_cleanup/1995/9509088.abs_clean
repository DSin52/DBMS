Relaxing first-class constraint conditions in the usual Drinfeld-SokolovHamiltonian reduction leads, after symmetry fixing, to realizations of Walgebras expressed in terms of all the J-current components. General resultsare given for G a non exceptional simple (finite and affine) algebra. Suchcalculations directly provide the commutant, in the (closure of) G envelopingalgebra, of the nilpotent subalgebra $G_-$, where the subscript refers to thechosen gradation in G. In the affine case, explicit expressions are presentedfor the Virasoro, $W_3$, and Bershadsky algebras at the quantum level.
