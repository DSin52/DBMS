Title: An Exact Membrane Quantization from W(Infinity) Symmetry

Comments: 15 pages

An exact quantization of the spherical membrane moving in flat targetspacetime backgrounds is performed. Crucial ingredients are the exactintegrabilty of the $3D~SU(\infty)$ continuous Toda equation and thequasi-finite highest weight irreducible representations of $W_{\infty}$algebras. Both continuous and discrete energy levels are found. The latter arefound for periodic-like solutions. Membrane wavefunctionals solutions are foundin terms of Bessel's functions and plausible relations to singleton fieldtheory are outlined.
