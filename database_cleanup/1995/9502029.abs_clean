We show that there is a series of topological string theories whose integrablestructure is described by the Toda lattice hierarchy. The monodromy group ofthe Frobenius manifold for the matter sector is an extension of the affine Weylgroup $\widetilde W (A_N^{(1)})$ introduced by Dubrovin. These models aregeneralizations of the topological $CP^1$ string theory with scaling violation.The logarithmic Hamiltonians generate flows for the puncture operator and itsdescendants. We derive the string equation from the constraints on the Lax andthe Orlov operators. The constraints are of different type from those for the$c=1$ string theory. Higher genus expansion is obtained by considering the Laxoperator in matrix form.
