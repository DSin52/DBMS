We review the new approach to the theory of nonlinear $W$-algebras which isdeveloped recently and called {\it conformal linearization}. In this approach$W$-algebras are embedded as subalgebras into some {\it linear conformal}algebras with a finite set of currents and most of their properties could beunderstood in a much simpler way by studing their linear counterpart. Thegeneral construction is illustrated by the examples of $u(N)$-superconformal,$W(sl(N),sl(2))$, $W(sl(N),sl(N))$ as well as $W(sl(N),sl(3))$ algebras.Applications to the construction of realizations (included modulo null fieldsrealizations) as well as central charge spectrum for minimal models ofnonlinear algebras are discussed.
