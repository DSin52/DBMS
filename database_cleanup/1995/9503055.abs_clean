We demonstrate that string consistency in four spacetime dimensions leads toa spectrum of string states which satisfies the supertrace constraintsStr(M^0)=0 and Str(M^2)=\Lambda at tree level, where \Lambda is the one-loopstring cosmological constant. This result holds for a large class of stringtheories, including critical heterotic strings. For strings lacking spacetimesupersymmetry, these supertrace constraints will be satisfied as a consequenceof a hidden ``misaligned supersymmetry'' in the string spectrum. These resultsthus severely constrain the possible supersymmetry-breaking scenarios in stringtheory, and suggest a new intrinsically stringy mechanism whereby suchsupertrace constraints may be satisfied without phenomenologically unacceptableconsequences.
