Some years ago, one of the authors~(MM) revived a concept to which he gavethe name of single-particle Dirac oscillator, while another~(CQ) showed that itcorresponds to a realization of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The Diracoscillator in its one- and many-body versions has had a great number ofapplications. Recently, it included the analytic expression for the eigenstatesand eigenvalues of a two-particle system with a new type of Dirac oscillatorinteraction of frequency~$\omega$. By considering the latter together with itspartner corresponding to the replacement of~$\omega$ by~$-\omega$, we are ableto get a supersymmetric formulation of the problem and find the superalgebrathat explains its degeneracy.
