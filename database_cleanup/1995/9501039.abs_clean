We introduce a new parametrisation for the Fermi sea of the $c = 1$ matrixmodel. This leads to a simple derivation of the scattering matrix, and acalculation of boundary corrections in the corresponding $1+1$--dimensionalstring theory. The new parametrisation involves relativistic chiral fields,rather than the non-relativistic fields of the usual formulations. Thecalculation of the boundary corrections, following recent work of Polchinski,allows us to place restrictions on the boundary conditions in the matrix model.We provide a consistent set of boundary conditions, but believe that they needto be supplemented by some more subtle relationship between the space-time andmatrix model. Inspired by these boundary conditions, some thoughts on the blackhole in $c=1$ string theory are presented.
