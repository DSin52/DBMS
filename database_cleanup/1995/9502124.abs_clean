We explore geometrical properties of fermionic vertex operators for a NSRsuperstring in order to establish connection between worldsheet and targetspace supersymmetries. The mechanism of picture-changing is obtained as aresult of imposing certain constraints on a world-sheet gauge group of the NSRtheory. It is found that picture-changing operators of various integer ghostnumbers form a polynomial ring. By using properties of the picture-changingformalism we establish connection between the NSR and GS superstring theories.We explore the properties of the $\kappa$-symmetry in the NSR formalism andshow that it leads to some new identities between correlation functions.
