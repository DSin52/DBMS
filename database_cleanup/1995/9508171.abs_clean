We examine supersymmetric quantum mechanics on $SO(4)$ to realize Witten'sidea. We find instanton solutions connecting approximate vacuums. We calculateHessian matrices for these solutions to determine true vacuums. Our result isin agreement with de Rham cohomology of $SO(4)$. We also give a criterion forcancellation of instanton effects for a pair of instanton paths.
