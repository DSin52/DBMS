We evaluate the quantum corrections of the Einstein-Hilbert action withboundaries in the $2+\epsilon$ dimensional expansion approach. We find theEinstein-Hilbert action with boundaries to be renormalizable to the one looporder. We compute the geometric entropy beyond the semiclassical approximation.It is found that the exact geometric entropy is related to the stringsucceptibility by the analytic continuation in the central charge. Our resultsalso show that we can renormalize the divergent quantum corrections for theBekenstein-Hawking entropy of blackholes by the gravitational coupling constantrenormalization beyond two dimensions.
