The Regge behaviour of the scattering amplitudes in perturbative QCD isgoverned in the generalized leading logarithmic approximation by thecontribution of the color--singlet compound states of Reggeized gluons. Theinteraction between Reggeons is described by the effective hamiltonian, whichin the multi--color limit turns out to be identical to the hamiltonian of thecompletely integrable one--dimensional XXX Heisenberg magnet of noncompact spin$s=0$. The spectrum of the color singlet Reggeon compound states - perturbativePomerons and Odderons, is expressed by means of the Bethe Ansatz in terms ofthe fundamental $Q-$function, which satisfies the Baxter equation for the XXXHeisenberg magnet. The exact solution of the Baxter equation is known only inthe simplest case of the compound state of two Reggeons, the BFKL Pomeron. Forhigher Reggeon states the method is developed which allows to find its generalsolution as an asymptotic series in powers of the inverse conformal weight ofthe Reggeon states. The quantization conditions for the conserved charges forinteracting Reggeons are established and an agreement with the results ofnumerical solutions is observed. The asymptotic approximation of the energy ofthe Reggeon states is defined based on the properties of the asymptotic series,and the intercept of the three--Reggeon states, perturbative Odderon, isestimated.
