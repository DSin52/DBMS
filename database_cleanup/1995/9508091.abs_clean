We show how a solitonic ``magnetically'' charged $p$-brane solution of agiven supergravity theory, with the magnetic charge carried by an antisymmetrictensor gauge field, can be generalized to a dyonic solution. We discuss thecases of ten-dimensional and eleven-dimensional supergravity in more detail anda new dyonic five-brane solution in ten dimensions is given. Unlike the purelyelectrically or magnetically charged five-brane solution the dyonic five-branecontains non-zero Ramond--Ramond fields and is therefore an intrinsicallytype~II solution. The solution preserves half of the type~II spacetimesupersymmetries. It is obtained by applying a solution-generating $SL(2,\R)\times SL(2,\R)$ $S$~duality transformation to the purely magnetically chargedfive-brane solution. One of the $SL(2,\R)$ duality transformations is basicallyan extension to the type~II case of the six-dimensional $\Z_2$ string/stringduality. We also present an action underlying the type IIB supergravity theory.
