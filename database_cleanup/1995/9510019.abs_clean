Starting from the structural similarity between the quantum theory of gaugesystems and that of the Kepler problem, an SU(2) gauge description of thefive-dimensional Kepler problem is given. This non-abelian gauge system is usedas a testing ground for the application of an algebraic constraint quantizationscheme which can be formulated entirely in terms of observable quantities. Forthe quantum mechanical reduction only the quadratic Casimir of the constraintalgebra, interpreted as an observable, is needed.
