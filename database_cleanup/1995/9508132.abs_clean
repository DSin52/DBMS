Different compactifications of six-dimensional string theory on $M_4 \timesT^2$ are considered. Particular attention is given to the roles of the reducedmodes as the $S$ and $T$ fields. It is shown that there is a discrete group ofinvariances of an equilateral triangle hidden in the model. This group isrealized as the interchanges of the two-form fields present in the intermediatestep of dimensional reduction in five dimensions. The key ingredient for theexistence of this group is the presence of an additional $U(1)$ gauge field infive dimensions, arising as the dual of the Kalb-Ramond axion field strength.As a consequence, the theory contains more four-dimensional $SL(2,R)$representations, with the resulting complex scalar axidilaton related to thecomponents of the Kaluza-Klein vector fields of the naive dimensionalreduction. An immediate byproduct of this relationship is a triadiccorrespondence among the fundamental string, the solitonic string, and asingular Brinkmann pp wave.
