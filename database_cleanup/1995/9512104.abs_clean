It is known that any minimal model M_p receives along its phi_31 irrelevantphi_{13}, the other from Z_{p-1} parafermionic model perturbed by itsgenerating parafermion field. By comparing Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz data and``predictions'' of infrared Conformal Perturbation Theory we show that thesetwo flows are received by M_p with opposite coupling constants of the phi_31irrelevant perturbation. Some comments on the massless S matrices of these twoflows are added.
