Recently we have shown that a phase transition occurs in the leading andsub-leading approximation of the large N limit in rigid strings coupled to longrange Kalb-Ramond interactions. The disordered phase is essentially theNambu-Goto-Polyakov string theory while the ordered phase is a new theory. Inthis letter we compute the free energy per unit length of the interacting rigidstring at finite temperature. We show that the mass of the winding statessolves that of QCD strings in the limit of high temperature. We obtain aprecise identification of the QCD coupling constant and those of theinteracting rigid string. The relation we obtain is$Ng_{QCD}^2=({4\pi^2(D-2)\over 3})^2{1\over 3\kappa}$ where$\kappa={Dt\alpha\over\pi\mu_{c}}$ is the ratio of the extrinsic curvaturecoupling constant t, the Kalb-Ramond coupling constant $\alpha$, and thecritical string tension $\mu_{c}$. The running beta function of $\kappa$reproduces correctly the asymptotic behaviour of QCD.
