We conjecture an exact S-matrix for the scattering of solitons in$d_{n+1}^{(2)}$ affine Toda field theory in terms of the R-matrix of thequantum group $U_q(c_n^{(1)})$. From this we construct the scatteringamplitudes for all scalar bound states (breathers) of the theory. This S-matrixconjecture is justified by detailed examination of its pole structure. We showthat a breather-particle identification holds by comparing the S-matrixelements for the lowest breathers with the S-matrix for the quantum particlesin real affine Toda field theory, and discuss the implications for variousforms of duality.
