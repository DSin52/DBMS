Title: A Gauge-Invariant Regularization of the Weyl Determinant Using Wavelets

Comments: 11 pages, latex

In line with a previous paper, a gauge-invariant regularization is developedfor the Weyl determinant of a Euclidean gauged chiral fermion. We restrictourselves to gauge configurations with the $A$ field going to zero at infinityin Euclidean space; and thus restrict gauge transformations to those with $U$the identity at infinity. For each finite cutoff one gets a strictlygauge-invariant expression for the Weyl determinant. Full Euclidean invarianceis only to be sought in the limit of removing the cutoff. We expect the limitto be Euclidean invariant, but this has not yet been proved. One need notenforce the no-anomaly condition on the representation of the gauge group! Weleave to future research relating the present results to conventional physicswisdom.
