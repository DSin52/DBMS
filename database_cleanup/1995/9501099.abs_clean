We show that the large N partition functions and Wilson loop observables oftwo-dimensional Yang-Mills theories admit a universal functional formirrespective of the gauge group. We demonstrate that U(N) QCD_2 undergoes alarge N, third-order phase transition on the projective plane at anarea-coupling product of \pi^2/2. We use this as a lemma to provide a directtranscription of the partition functions and phase portraits of Yang-Millstheory from the U(N) on RP^2 at large N to the other classical Lie groups onS^2. We compute the expectation value of the Wilson loops in the fundamentalrepresentation for SO(N) and Sp(N) on the two sphere. Finally we compare thestrong- and weak-coupling limit of these expressions with those found elswherein the literature.
