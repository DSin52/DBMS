Given a finite dimensional C-*-Hopf algebra H and its dual H^ we constructthe infinite crossed product A=... x H x H^ x H x ... and study itsrepresentations. A is the observable algebra of a generalized spin model withH-order and H^-disorder symmetries. By pointing out that A possesses a certaincompressibility property we can classify all DHR-sectors of A --- relative tosome Haag dual vacuum representation --- and prove that their symmetry isdescribed by the Drinfeld double D(H). Complete, irreducible, translationcovariant field algebra extensions F > A are shown to be in one-to-onecorrespondence with cohomology classes of 2-cocycles u in D(H) @ D(H).
