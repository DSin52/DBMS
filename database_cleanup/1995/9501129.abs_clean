The time evolution in a supersymmetric extension of the Kodomtsev-Petviashvillihierarchy, a classical integrable system, is shown to be Hamiltonian. Thecanonical bracket associated to the Hamiltonian evolution is the classicalanalog of the antibracket encountered in the quantization of gauge theories.This provides a new understanding of supersymmetric Hamiltonian systems.
