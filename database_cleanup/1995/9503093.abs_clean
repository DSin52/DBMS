We study the Riemannian aspect and the Hilbert-Einstein gravitational action ofthe non-commutative geometry underlying the Connes-Lott construction of theaction functional of the standard model. This geometry involves a two-sheeted,Euclidian space-time. We show that if we require the space of forms to belocally isotropic and the Higgs scalar to be dynamical, then the Riemannianmetrics on the two sheets of Euclidian space-time must be identical. We alsoshow that the distance function between the two sheets is determined by asingle, real scalar field whose VEV sets the weak scale.
