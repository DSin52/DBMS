We consider BRST-invariant inner product states for quantum electrodynamicsconstructed from trivial BRST-invariant states and a gauge regulator. Thetrivial states are products of matter and ghost states and are annihilated byhermitian operators. The co-BRST operator and some further gauge-fixingregulators are found. The relation between gauge fixing and time evolution ofboth the trivial and the inner product states is discussed.
