Starting from a reformulation of the Thirring model as a gauge theory, weconsider the bosonization of the $D$-dimensional multiflavor massive Thirringmodel $(D \ge 2)$ with four-fermion interaction of the current-current type.Our method leads to a novel interpolating Lagrangian written in terms of twogauge fields. Especially we pay attention to the case of very massive fermion$m \gg 1$ in (2+1) and (1+1) dimensions. Up to the next-to-leading order of$1/m$, we show that the (2+1)-dimensional massive Thirring model is mapped tothe Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and that the (1+1)-dimensional massive Thirringmodel is equivalent to the massive free scalar field theory. In the process ofthe bosonization of the Thirring model, we point out the importance of thegauge-invariant formulation. Finally we discuss a possibility of extending thismethod to the non-Abelian case.
