Drawing on the parallel between general relativity and Yang-Mills theory weobtain an exact Schwarzschild-like solution for SU(2) gauge fields coupled to amassless scalar field. Pushing the analogy further we speculate that thisclassical solution to the Yang-Mills equations shows confinement in the sameway that particles become confined once they pass the event horizon of theSchwarzschild solution. Two special cases of the solution are considered.
