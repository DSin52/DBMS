Title: Randomly coupled minimal models

Comments: 12 pages, latex, 1 eps figures; new results added

Using 1-loop renormalisation group equations, we analyze the effect ofrandomness on multi-critical unitary minimal conformal models. We study thecase of two randomly coupled $M_p$ models and found that they flow in twodecoupled $M_{p-1}$ models, in the infra-red limit. This result is then extendto the case with $M$ randomly coupled $M_p$ models, which will flow toward $M$decoupled $M_{p-1}$.
