We investigate the compactification of D=11 supergravity to D=5,4,3, oncompact manifolds of holonomy $SU(3)$ (Calabi-Yau), $G_2$, and $Spin(7)$,respectively, making use of examples of the latter two cases found recently byJoyce. In each case the lower dimensional theory is a Maxwell/Einsteinsupergravity theory. We find evidence for an equivalence, in certain cases,with heterotic string compactifications from D=10 to D=5,4,3, on compactmanifolds of holonomy $SU(2)$ ($K_3\times S^1$), $SU(3)$, and $G_2$,respectively. Calabi-Yau manifolds with Hodge numbers $h_{1,1}=h_{1,2}=19$ playa significant role in the proposed equivalences.
