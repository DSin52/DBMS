We search for $N=2$, $d=4$ theories which can be realized both as heteroticstring compactifications on $K_{3}\times T^{2}$ and as type II stringcompactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. In such cases, the exactnon-perturbative superpotential of one string theory is given in terms of treelevel computations in the other string theory. In particular we find concreteexamples which provide the stringy realization of the results of Seiberg andWitten on N=2 Yang-Mills theory, corrected by gravitational/stringy effects. Wealso discuss some examples which shed light on how the moduli spaces ofdifferent N=2 heterotic vacua are connected.
