"New Developments in string gravity and physics at the Planck energy scale"(World Scientific, Singapore, 1995)Recent results on classical and quantum strings in a variety of black holeand cosmological spacetimes, in various dimensions, are presented. The curvedbackgrounds under consideration include the $2+1$ black hole anti de Sitterspacetime and its dual, the black string, the ordinary $D\geq 4$ black holeswith or without a cosmological constant, the de Sitter and anti de Sitterspacetimes and static Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Exact solutions to thestring equations of motion and constraints are obtained in these backgroundsand their physical properties (length, energy, pressure) are described. Theexistence of {\it multi-string} solutions, describing finitely or infinitelymany strings, is shown to be a general feature of spacetimes with a positive ornegative cosmological constant. Furthermore, using a canonical quantizationprocedure, we find the string mass spectrum in de Sitter and anti de Sitterspacetimes. New features as compared to the string spectrum in flat Minkowskispacetime appear, for instance the {\it fine-structure effect} at all levelsbeyond the graviton in both de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetimes, and the{\it non-existence} of a Hagedorn temperature in anti de Sitter spacetime.Finally, we consider the effect of spatial curvature on the string dynamics inRobertson-Walker spacetimes.
