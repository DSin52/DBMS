In these lectures we review the quantum physics of large Schwarzschild blackholes. Hawking's information paradox, the theory of the stretched horizon andthe principle of black hole complementarity are covered. We then discuss howthe ideas of black hole complementarity may be realized in string theory.Finally, arguments are given that the world may be a hologram. Lecturesdelivered at ICTP Spring School on String Theory, Gauge Theory, and QuantumGravity, 1995.
