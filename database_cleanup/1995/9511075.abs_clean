We investigate some classical aspects of fundamental strings via numericalexperiments. In particular, we study the thermodynamics of a string networkwithin a toroidal universe, as a function of string energy density and spacedimensionality. We find that when the energy density of the system is low, thedominant part of the string is in the form of closed loops of the shortestallowed size, which correspond to the momentum string modes. At a certaincritical energy density corresponding to the Hagedorn temperature, the systemundergoes a phase transition characterized by the formation of very long loops,winding a number of times around the torus. These loops correspond to thewinding string modes. As the energy density is increased, all the extra energygoes into these long strings. We then study the lifetime of winding modes as afunction of the space densionality. We find that in the low--energy densityregime, long winding strings decay only if the space dimensionality of thetoroidal universe is equal to 3. This finding supports the proposedcosmological scenario by Brandenberger and Vafa, which attempts to explain thespace dimensionality and to avoid the initial singularity by means of stringtheory.
