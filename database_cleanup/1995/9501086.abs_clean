Comments: Amstex file (version 2,0), 11 pages, no figures

The 3+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory with the Pontryagin term included isstudied on manifolds with a boundary. Based on the geometry of the universalbundle for Yang-Mills theory, the symplectic structure of this model isexhibited. The topological type of the quantization line bundles is shown to bedetermined by the torsion elements in the cohomology of the gauge orbit space.
