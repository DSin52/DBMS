We argue for the presence of a ${\bf Z}_2$ topological structure in the spaceof static gauge-Higgs field configurations of $SU(2n)$ and $SO(2n)$ Yang-Millstheories. We rigorously prove the existence of a ${\bf Z}_2$ homotopy group ofmappings from the 2-dim. projective sphere ${\bf R}P^2$ into $SU(2n)/{\bf Z}_2$and $SO(2n)/{\bf Z}_2$ Lie groups respectively. Consequently the symmetricphase of these theories admits infinite surfaces of odd-parity static andunstable gauge field configurations which divide into two disconnected sectorswith integer Chern-Simons numbers $n$ and $n+1/2$ respectively. Such a ${\bfZ}_2$ structure persists in the Higgs phase of the above theories and accountsfor the existence of $CS=1/2$ odd-parity saddle point solutions to the fieldequations which correspond to spontaneous symmetry breaking mass scales.
