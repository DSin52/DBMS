In this paper we show how the BRST quantization can be applied to systemspossessing only second-class constraints through their conversion to somefirst-class ones starting with our method exposed in [Nucl.Phys. B456(1995)473]. Thus, it is proved that i) for a certain class of second-classsystems there exists a standard coupling between the variables of the originalphase-space and some extravariables such that we can transform the originalsystem into a one-parameter family of first-class systems; ii) the BRSTquantization of this family in a standard gauge leads to the same path integralas that of the original system. The analysis is accomplished in both reducibleand irreducible cases. In the same time, there is obtained the Lagrangianaction of the first-class family and its provenience is clarified. In thiscontext, the Wess-Zumino action is also derived. The results from thetheoretical part of the paper are exemplified in detail for the massiveYang-Mills theory and for the massive abelian three-form gauge fields.
