Witten proposed that the low energy physics of strongly coupled D=10 type-IIAsuperstring may be described by D=11 supergravity. To explore the stringyaspects of the underlying theory we examine the stringy massive states. Wepropose a systematic formula for identifying non-perturbative states in D=10type-IIA superstring theory, such that, together with the elementary excitedstring states, they form D=11 supersymmetric multiplets multiplets in SO(10)representations. This provides hints for the construction of a weakly coupledD=11 theory that is dual to the strongly coupled D=10 type IIA superstring.
