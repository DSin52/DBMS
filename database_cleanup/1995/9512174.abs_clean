In this paper we present a detailed study of the quantum conservation lawsfor Toda field theories defined on the half plane in the presence of a boundaryperturbation. We show that total derivative terms added to the currents, whileirrelevant at the classical level, become important at the quantum level and ingeneral modify significantly the quantum boundary conservation. We consider thefirst nontrivial higher--spin currents for the simply laced $a^{(1)}_n $ Todacharge only if the boundary potential is appropriately redefined through afinite renormalization. Contrary to the expectation we demonstrate instead thatat spin four the classical symmetry does not survive quantization and wesuspect that this feature will persist at higher--spin levels. Finally weexamine the first nontrivial conservations at spin four for the $d^{(2)}_3$ and$c^{(1)}_2$ nonsimply laced Toda theories. In these cases the addition of totalderivative terms to the bulk currents is necessary but sufficient to ensure theexistence of corresponding quantum exact conserved charges.
