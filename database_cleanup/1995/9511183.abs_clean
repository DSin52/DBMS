Title: A remark on the gauging of chiral bosons

Comments: LATEX file, severely revised version, LATEX, 18 pages

We study the interacting chiral boson and observe that a naive gaugingprocedure leaves the covariant chiral constraint incompatible with the fieldchiral scalar, only the coupling with the left chiral currents leads toconsistent results, in discordance with current literature.
