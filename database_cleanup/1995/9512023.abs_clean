It is shown that for 2D field theories only the first order coefficient ofthe gravitationally dressed RG $\beta$-function is scheme independent. This isvalid even for matter theories with one dimensionless coupling, where the firsttwo coefficients of the original $\beta$-function are scheme independent.
