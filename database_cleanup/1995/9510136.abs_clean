We present several forms in which the BRST transformations of QCD incovariant gauges can be cast. They can be non-local and even not manifestlycovariant. These transformations may be obtained in the path integral formalismby non standard integrations in the ghost sector or by performing changes ofghost variables which leave the action and the path integral measure invariant.For different changes of ghost variables in the BRST and anti-BRSTtransformations these two transformations no longer anticommute.
