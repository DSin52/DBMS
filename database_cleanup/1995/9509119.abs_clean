The noncritical $D=4$ $W_3$ string is a model of $W_3$ gravity coupled to twofree scalar fields. In this paper we discuss its BRST quantization in directanalogy with that of the $D=2$ (Virasoro) string. In particular, we calculatethe physical spectrum as a problem in BRST cohomology. The correspondingoperator cohomology forms a BV-algebra. We model this BV-algebra on that of thepolyderivations of a commutative ring on six variables with a quadraticconstraint, or, equivalently, on the BV-algebra of (polynomial) polyvectorfields on the base affine space of $SL(3,C)$. In this paper we attempt topresent a complete summary of the progress made in these studies. [...]
