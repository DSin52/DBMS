We consider the model of self-interacting complex scalar fields with a rigidgauge invariance under an arbitrary gauge group $G$. In order to analyze thephenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation finite temperature and the possibilityof a finite background charge is included. Different approaches to derive therelevant high-temperature behaviour of the theory are presented.
