We present a new quantization scheme for $2D$ gravity coupled to an $SU(2)$principal chiral field and a dilaton; this model represents a slightlysimplified version of stationary axisymmetric quantum gravity. The analysismakes use of the separation of variables found in our previous work [1] and isbased on a two-time hamiltonian approach. The quantum constraints are shown toreduce to a pair of compatible first order equations, with the dilaton playingthe role of a ``clock field''. Exact solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equationare constructed via the integral formula for solutions of theKnizhnik-Zamolodchiokov equations.
