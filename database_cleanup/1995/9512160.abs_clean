Trends in QFT (August 1995), Razlog, BulgariaW_{1+infty} is defined as an infinite dimensional Lie algebra spanned by theunit operator and the Laurent modes of a series of local quasiprimary chiralfields V^l(z) of dimension l+1 (l=0,1,2,...). These fields are neutral withrespect to the u(1) current J(z)=V^0(z); as a result the (l+2)-fold commutatorof J with V^l vanishes. We outline a construction of rational conformal fieldtheories with stress energy tensor T(z)=V^1(z) whose chiral algebras includeall V^l's. It is pointed out that earlier work on local extensions of the u(1)current algebra solves the problem of classifying all such theories forVirasoro central charge c=1.
