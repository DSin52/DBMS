It has recently been conjectured that the type IIA string theory compactifiedon K3 and the heterotic string theory compactified on a four dimensional torusdescribe identical string theories. The fundamental heterotic string can beregarded as a non-singular soliton solution of the type IIA string theory witha semi-infinite throat. We show that this solution admits 24 parameternon-singular deformation describing a fundamental heterotic string carryingelectric charge and current. The charge is generated due to the coupling of thegauge fields to the anti-symmetric tensor field, and not to an explicit sourceterm. This clarifies how soliton solutions carrying charge under theRamond-Ramond fields can be constructed in the type IIA theory, and providesfurther support to the string string duality conjecture. Similarly, thefundamental type IIA string can be regarded as a non-singular solution of theheterotic string theory with a semi-infinite throat, but this solution does notadmit any deformation representing charged string. This is also consistent withthe expectation that a fundamental type IIA string does not carry any chargethat couples to the fields originating in the Ramond-Ramond sector.
