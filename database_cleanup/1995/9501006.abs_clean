The possibility of the application of the free field representation developedby Lukyanov for massive integrable models is investigated in the context of theO(3) sigma model. We use the bootstrap fusion procedure to construct a freefield representation for the O(3) Zamolodchikov- Faddeev algebra and to writedown a representation for the solutions of the form-factor equations which issimilar to the ones obtained previously for the sine-Gordon and SU(2) Thirringmodels. We discuss also the possibility of developing further thisrepresentation for the O(3) model and comment on the extension to otherintegrable field theories.
