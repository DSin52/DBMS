We present some generalizations of a recently proposed alternative approachto nonabelian gauge theories based on the causal Epstein-Glaser method inperturbative quantum field theory. Nonabelian gauge invariance is defined by asimple commutator relation in every order of perturbation theory separatelyusing only the linear (abelian) BRS-transformations of the asymptotic fields.This condition is sufficient for the unitarity of the S-matrix in the physicalsubspace. We derive the most general specific coupling compatible with theconditions of nonabelian gauge invariance and normalizability. We explicitlyshow that the quadrilinear terms, the four-gluon-coupling and thefour-ghost-coupling, are generated by our linear condition of nonabelian gaugeinvariance. Moreover, we work out the required generalizations for lineargauges.
