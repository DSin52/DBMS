We prove gauge-independence of one-loop path integral for on-shell quantumgravity obtained in a framework of modified geometric approach. We useprojector on pure gauge directions constructed via quadratic form of theaction. This enables us to formulate the proof entirely in terms ofdeterminants of non-degenerate elliptic operators without reference to anyrenormalization procedure. The role of the conformal factor rotation inachieving gauge-independence is discussed. Direct computations on $CP^2$ in ageneral three-parameter background gauge are presented. We comment on gaugedependence of previous results by Ichinose.
