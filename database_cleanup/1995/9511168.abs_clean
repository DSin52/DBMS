We show that the zero-temperature physics of planar Josephson junction arraysin the self-dual approximation is governed by an Abelian gauge theory withperiodic mixed Chern-Simons term describing the charge-vortex coupling. Theperiodicity requires the existence of (Euclidean) topological excitations whichdetermine the quantum phase structure of the model. The electric-magneticduality leads to a quantum phase transition between a superconductor and asuperinsulator at the self-dual point. We also discuss in this framework therecently proposed quantum Hall phases for charges and vortices in presence ofcharge-vortex coupling can lead to transitions to anyon superconductivityphases. We finally generalize our results to three dimensions, where therelevant gauge theory is the so-called BF system, with an antisymmetricKalb-Ramond gauge field.
