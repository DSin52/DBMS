Title: A Topological Study of Induced Representation

Comments: 15 pages, no figures

From the point of view of topology we study the induced representationtechnique which E. Wigner proposed in 1939. We comment on the gauge structurein the induced representation technique and construc the explicit form of thegauge fields. The topological results ofour study are applied to quantummechanics on a d-dimensional sphere and its path integral is formulated.
