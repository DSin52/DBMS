(ysmyung@physics.inje.ac.kr)We discuss the stability of the extremal ground states of a two-dimensional(2D) charged black hole which carries both electric ($Q_E$) and magnetic($Q_M$) charges. The method is first to find the physical field and then toderive the equation of the Schr\"odinger type. It is found that the presentingpotential to an on-coming tachyon (as a spectator) takes a barrier-well type.This provides the bound state solution, which implies an exponentially growingmode with respect to time. The 2D extremal ground states all are classicallyunstable. We conclude that the 2D extremal charged black holes are notconsidered as the candidates for the stable endpoint of the Hawkingevaporation.
