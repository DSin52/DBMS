We use path-integrals to derive a general expression for the semiclassicalapproximation to the partition function of a one-dimensional quantum-mechanicalsystem. Our expression depends solely on ordinary integrals which involve thepotential. For high temperatures, the semiclassical expression is dominated bysingle closed paths. As we lower the temperature, new closed paths appear,including tunneling paths. The transition from single to multiple-path regimecorresponds to well-defined catastrophes. Tunneling sets in whenever theyoccur. (Our formula fully accounts for this feature.)
