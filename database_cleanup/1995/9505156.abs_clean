Requiring that a Lagrangian path integral leads to certain identities (Wardidentities in a broad sense) can be formulated in a general BRST language, ifnecessary by the use of collective fields. The condition of BRST symmetry canthen be expressed with the help of the antibracket, and suitablegeneralizations thereof. In particular, a new Grassmann-odd bracket, whichreduces to the conventional antibracket in a special limit, naturally appears.We illustrate the formalism with various examples.
