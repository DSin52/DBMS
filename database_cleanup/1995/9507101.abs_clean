The two-point Green function of the massive scalar $(3+1)$-quantum fieldtheory with $\lambda\varphi^4$ interaction at finite temperature is evaluatedup to the 2nd order of perturbation theory. The averaging on the vacuumfluctuations is separated from the averaging on the thermal fluctuationsexplicitly. As a result, the temperature dependent part of the propagator isexpressed through the scattering amplitudes. The obtained expression isgeneralized for higher orders of perturbation theory.
