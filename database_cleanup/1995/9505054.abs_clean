The existence of maximally supersymmetric solutions to heterotic stringtheory that are not toroidal compactifications of the ten-dimensionalsuperstring is established. We construct an exact fermionic realization of anN=1 supersymmetric string theory in D=8 with non-simply-laced gauge groupSp(20). Toroidal compactification to six and four dimensions gives maximallyextended supersymmetric theories with reduced rank (4,12) and (6,14)respectively.
