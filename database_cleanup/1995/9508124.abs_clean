We derive, for $N\is2$ super-Yang--Mills with gauge group $SU(2)$ andmassless matter, the supersymmetric quantum mechanical models describing thetime evolution of multi-monopole configurations in the low energyapproximation. This is a first step towards identifying the solitonic statesmapped to fundamental excitations by duality in the model with fourhypermultiplets in the fundamental representation.
