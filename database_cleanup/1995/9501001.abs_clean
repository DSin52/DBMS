Title: Anomaly and Exotic Statistics in One Dimension

Comments: LATEX file, 38 pages

We study the influence of the anomaly on the physical quantum picture of thechiral Schwinger model (CSM) defined on $S^1$. We show that such phenomena asthe total screening of charges and the dynamical mass generation characteristicfor the standard Schwinger model do not take place here. Instead of them, theanomaly results in the background linearly rising electric field or,equivalently, in the exotic statistics of the physical matter field. Weconstruct the algebra of the Poincare generators and show that it differs fromthe Poincare one. For the CSM on $R^1$, the anomaly influences only the massgeneration mechanism.
