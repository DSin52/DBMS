There exist certain intrinsic relations between the ultraviolet divergentgraphs and the convergent ones at the same loop order in renormalizable quantumfield theories. Whereupon we may establish a new method, the intrinsicregularization method, to regularize those divergent graphs. In this paper, weapply this method to QCD at the one loop order. It turns out to bethe same as those derived by means of other regularization methods.
