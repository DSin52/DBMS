In the spirit of previous papers, but using more general fieldconfigurations, the non-linear O(3) model in (2+1)-D, modified by the additionof both a potential-like term and a Skyrme-like term, is considered. Theinstanton solutions are numerically evolved in time and some of their stabilityproperties studied. They are found to be stable, and a repulsive force is seento exist among them. These results, which are restricted to the case of zerospeed systems, confirm those obtained in previous investigations, in which asimilar problem was studied for a different choice of the potential-like term.
