A recent result of Gusynin, Miransky and Shovkovy concerning chiral symmetrybreaking by a constant external magnetic field in parity-invariantthree-dimensional QED is generalised to the case of inhomogeneous fields byrelating the phenomenon to the zero modes of the Dirac equation. Virtual photonradiative corrections and four-dimensional QED are briefly discussed.
