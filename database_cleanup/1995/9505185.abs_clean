It is shown that nonvacuum pseudoparticles can account for quantum tunnelingand metastability. In particular the saddle-point nature of the pseudoparticlesis demonstrated, and the evaluation of path-integrals in their neighbourhood.Finally the relation between instantons and bounces is used to derive a resultconjectured by Bogomolny and Fateyev.
