Title: A WAY TO BREAK SUPERSYMMETRY

Comments: 20 pages, Latex file

I study the spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry when higher-dimensionalYang-Mills or the type-I $SO(32)$ string theory are compactified on magnetizedtori. Because of the universal gyromagnetic ratio $g=2$, the splittings of allmultiplets are given by the product of charge times internal helicityoperators. As a result such compactifications have two remarkable and robustlow-energy supersymmetry in the limit of large tori, and {\it (b)} they cantrigger gauge-symmetry breaking, via Nielsen-Olesen instabilities, at a scaletied classically to $m_{SUSY}$. I exhibit a compactification of the $SO(32)$superstring, in which magnetic fields break spontaneously $N=4$ supersymmetry,produce the standard-model gauge group with three chiral families of quarks andleptons, and trigger electroweak symmetry breaking. I discuss supertracerelations and the ensuing ultraviolet softness. As with other known mechanismsthreat to perturbative calculability in the decompactification limit, and theproblem of gravitational stability and in particular of the cosmologicalconstant. I explain, however, why a good classical description of the vacuummay require small tadpoles for the dilaton, moduli and metric.
