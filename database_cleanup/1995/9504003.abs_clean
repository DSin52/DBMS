Recently, certain higher dimensional complex manifolds were obtained in[hep-th/9412078] by associating a higher dimensional uniformisation to thegeneralised Teichm\"uller spaces of Hitchin. The extra dimensions are providedby the ``times'' of the generalised KdV hierarchy. In this paper, we completethe proof that these manifolds provide the analog of superspace for W-gravityand that W-symmetry linearises on these spaces. This is done by explicitlyconstructing the relationship between the Beltrami differentials whichnaturally occur in the higher dimensional manifolds and the Beltramidifferentials which occur in W-gravity. This also resolves an old puzzleregarding the relationship between KdV flows and W-diffeomorphisms.
