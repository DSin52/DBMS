We exhibit the gauge-group independence (``universality'') of all normalizednon-intersecting Wilson loop expectation values in the large N limit oftwo-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. This universality is most easily understoodvia the string theory reformulation of these gauge theories. By constructing anisomorphism between the string maps contributing to normalized Wilson loopexpectation values in the different theories, we prove the large N universalityof these observables on any surface. The string calculation of the Wilson loopexpectation value on the sphere also leads to an indication of the large Nphase transition separating strong- and weak-coupling phases.
