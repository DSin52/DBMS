Title: Hidden Symmetry and S-duality in N=4 D=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory

Comments: Contr. Proc. VI Quantum Gravity Seminar, June, 1995; 6 pages, LATEX

In this talk the Schwarz hypothesis that the duality symmetries should bepieces of the hidden gauge symmetry in a string theory is discussed. Usingauxiliary linear system special dual transformations for $N=4$ SYM generalizingthe Schwarz dual transformations for a principal chiral model are constructed.These transformations are related with a continuous group of hidden symmetry ofa new model involving more fields as compare with $N=4$ SYM. We conjecture thatthe $Z_{2}$ discrete subgroup of this hidden symmetry group has a stable set ofN=4 YM fields and transforms a self-dual configuration to an anti-self-dual andvia versa.
