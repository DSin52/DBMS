We study two--loop renormalization in $(2+\epsilon)$--dimensional quantumgravity. As a first step towards the full calculation, we concentrate on thedivergences which are proportional to the number of matter fields. We calculatethe $\beta$ functions and show how the nonlocal divergences as well as theinfrared divergences cancel among the diagrams. Although the formalism includesa subtlety concerning the general covariance due to the dynamics of theconformal mode, we find that the renormalization group allows the existence ofa fixed point which possesses the general covariance. Our results stronglysuggest that we can construct a consistent theory of quantum gravity by the$\epsilon$ expansion around two dimensions.
