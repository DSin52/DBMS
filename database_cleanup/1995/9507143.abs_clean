Magnetic fields in five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory compactified on acircle correspond to ``twisted'' identifications of five dimensional Minkowskispace. We show that a five dimensional generalisation of the Kerr solution canbe analytically continued to construct an instanton that gives rise to twopossible decay modes of a magnetic field. One decay mode is the generalisationof the ``bubble decay" of the Kaluza-Klein vacuum described by Witten. Theother decay mode, rarer for weak fields, corresponds in four dimensions to thecreation of monopole-anti-monopole pairs. An instanton for the latter processis already known and is given by the analytic continuation of the \KK\ Ernstmetric, which we show is identical to the five dimensional Kerr solution. Weuse this fact to illuminate further properties of the decay process. It appearsthat fundamental fermions can eliminate the bubble decay of the magnetic field,while allowing the pair production of Kaluza-Klein monopoles.
