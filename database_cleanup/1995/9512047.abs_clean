It is known that gauge fields defined on manifolds with spatial boundariessupport states localized at the boundaries. In this paper, we demonstrate howcoarse-graining over these states can lead to an entanglement entropy. Inparticular, we show that the entanglement entropy of the ground state for thequantum Hall effect on a disk exhibits an approximate ``area " law.
