We obtain a bilocal classical field theory as the large $N$ limit of the chiralGross--Neveu (or non--abelian Thirring) model. Exact classical solutions thatdescribe topological solitons are obtained. It is shown that their massspectrum agrees with the large $N$ limit of the spectrum of the chiralGross--Neveu model.
