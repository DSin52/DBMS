Title: COMPLEX STRING AS SOURCE OF KERR GEOMETRY

Comments: This paper is dedicated to the memory of Professor Dmitri Ivanenko

who died on 30th December 1994. 12 pages., LaTeXThe Kerr solution is considered as a soliton-like background for spinningelementary particles. Two stringy structures may be found in the Kerr geometry,one string is real and another one is complex. The main attention in this paperis paid to the complex string, which is connected with the Lind-Newmanrepresentation of the Kerr metric source as an object with a complexworld-line. In a separate note, one new result is announced concerning the realas a heterotic string, the field near the Kerr singularity coincides with thesolution obtained by Sen for heterotic string.
