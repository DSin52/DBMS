We evaluate zeta-functions $\zeta(s)$ at $s=0$ for invariant non-minimal2nd-order vector and tensor operators defined on maximally symmetric evendimensional spaces. We decompose the operators into their irreducible parts andobtain their corresponding eigenvalues. Using these eigenvalues, we are able toexplicitly calculate $\zeta(0)$ for the cases of Euclidean spaces and$N$-spheres. In the $N$-sphere case, we make use of the Euler-Maclaurin formulato develop asymptotic expansions for the required sums. The resulting$\zeta(0)$ values for dimensions 2 to 10 are given in the Appendix.
