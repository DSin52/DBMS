We obtain three generation SU(3)_c X SU(2)_L X U(1)_Y string models in all ofthe exactly solvable (0,2) constructions sampled by fermionization. None ofthese examples, including those that are symmetric abelian orbifolds, rely onthe Z_2 X Z_2 orbifold underlying the NAHE basis. We present the first knownthree generation models for which the hypercharge normalization, k_1, takesvalues smaller than that obtained from an SU(5) embedding, thus lowering theeffective gauge coupling unification scale. All of the models containfractional electrically charged and vectorlike exotic matter that could survivein the light spectrum.
