We argue that, at finite temperature, parity invariant non-compactelectrodynamics with massive electrons in 2+1 dimensions can exist in bothconfined and deconfined phases. We show that an order parameter for theconfinement-deconfinement phase transition is the Polyakov loop operator whoseaverage measures the free energy of a test charge that is not an integralmultiple of the electron charge. The effective field theory for the Polyakovloop operator is a 2-dimensional Euclidean scalar field theory with a globaldiscrete symmetry $Z$, the additive group of the integers. We argue that therealization of this symmetry governs confinement and that theconfinement-deconfinement phase transition is ofBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. We compute the effective action toone-loop order and argue that when the electron mass $m$ is much greater thanthe temperature $T$ and dimensional coupling $e^2$, the effective field theoryis the Sine-Gordon model. In this limit, we estimate the critical temperature,$T_{\rm crit.}=e^2/8\pi(1-e^2/12\pi m+\ldots)$.
