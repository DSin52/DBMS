We study radiation from black holes in the effective theory produced byintegrating gravity and the dilaton out of $1+1$ dilaton gravity. Thesemiclassical wavefunctions for the dressed particles show that theself-interactions produce an unusual renormalization of the frequencies ofoutgoing states. Modes propagating in the dynamical background of an incomingquantum state are seen to acquire large scattering phases that neverthelessconspire, in the absence of self-interactions, to preserve the thermality ofthe Hawking radiation. However, the in-out scattering matrix does not commutewith the self-interactions and this could lead to observable corrections to thefinal state. Finally, our calculations explicitly display the limited validityof the semiclassical theory of Hawking radiation and provide support for aformulation of black hole complementarity.
