For fields that vary slowly on the scale of the lightest mass the logarithmof the vacuum functional can be expanded as a sum of local functionals, howeverthis does not satisfy the obvious form of the Schr\"odinger equation. For$\varphi^4$ theory we construct the appropriate equation that this expansiondoes satisfy. This reduces the eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian to a setof algebraic equations. We suggest two approaches to their solution. The firstis equivalent to the usual semi-classical expansion whilst the other is a newscheme that may also be applied to theories that are classically massless butin which mass is generated quantum mechanically.
