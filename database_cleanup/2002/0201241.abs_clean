It has recently been shown that there exist stable inhomogeneous neutralblack strings in higher dimensional gravity. These solutions were motivated bythe fact that the corresponding homogeneous solutions are unstable. We showthat there exist new inhomogeneous black string and black p-brane solutionseven when the corresponding translationally invariant solutions are stable. Inparticular, we show there exist inhomogeneous near-extremal black strings andp-branes. Some of these solutions remain inhomogeneous even when the size ofthe compact direction (at infinity) is very small.
