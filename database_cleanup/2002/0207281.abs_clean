Under certain conditions some solutions to five-dimensional heteroticM-theory can be accurately described by the four-dimensional action of thetheory - they have a four-dimensional limit. We consider the connection betweensolutions of four and five-dimensional heterotic M-theory when movingfive-branes are present in the bulk. We begin by describing how to raise theknown four-dimensional moving brane solutions to obtain approximate solutionsto the five-dimensional theory, presenting for the first time the metrictemplate necessary for this procedure. We then present the first solutions tothe five-dimensional theory containing moving five-branes. We can then discussthe connection between our new exact five-dimensional solution and thefour-dimensional ones. It is shown that our new solution corresponds to asolution with a static brane in four-dimensions. In other words our newsolution could not have been identified as containing a moving brane from apurely four-dimensional viewpoint.
