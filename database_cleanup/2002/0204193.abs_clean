summer school and Workshops on High Energy Physics, Corfu, Greece, 13 Aug.-13Sept. 2001Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we study vacua of N=4 SYM for which part ofthe gauge symmetry is broken by expectation values of scalar fields. A specificsubclass of such vacua can be analyzed with gauged supergravity and thecorresponding domain wall solutions lift to continuous distributions ofD3-branes in type IIB string theory. Due to the non-trivial expectation valueof the scalars, the SO(6) R-symmetry is spontaneously broken and field theorypredicts the existence of Goldstone bosons. We explicitly show that, in thedual supergravity description, these emerge as massless poles in the currenttwo-point functions, while the bulk gauge fields which are dual to the brokencurrents become massive via the Higgs mechanism. We find agreement with fieldtheory expectations and, hence, provide a non-trivial test of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence far away from the conformal point.
