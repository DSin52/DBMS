For the purpose of analyzing non-perturbative dynamics of string theory,Nishimura and Sugino have applied an improved mean field approximation (IMFA)to IIB matrix model. We have extracted the essence of the IMFA and obtained ageneral scheme, an improved Taylor expansion, that can be applied to a wideclass of series which is not necessarily convergent. This approximation schemewith the help of the 2PI free energy enables us to perform higher ordercalculations. We have shown that the value of the free energy is stable athigher orders, which supports the validity of the approximation. Moreover, theratio between the extent of ``our'' space-time and that of the internal spaceis found to increase rapidly as we take the higher orders into account. Ourresults suggest that the four dimensional space-time emerges spontaneously inIIB matrix model.
