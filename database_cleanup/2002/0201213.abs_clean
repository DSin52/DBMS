In this paper we calculate the Casimir energy for spherical shell withmassless self-interacting scalar filed which satisfying Dirichlet boundaryconditions on the shell. Using zeta function regularization and heat kernelcoefficients we obtain the divergent contributions inside and outside ofCasimir energy. The effect of self-interacting term is similar with existing ofmass for filed. In this case some divergent part arises. Using therenormalization procedure of bag model we can cancel these divergent parts.
