focusing on discussion of high density matterWe consider the evolution of small rotational perturbations, with azimuthalsymmetry, of the brane-world cosmological models. The equations describing thetemporal, radial, and angular dependence of the perturbations are derived bytaking into account the effects of both scalar and tensor parts of the darkenergy term on the brane. The time decay of the initial rotation isinvestigated for several types of equation of state of the ultra-high densitycosmological matter. For an expanding Universe, rotation always decays in thecase of the perfect dragging, for which the angular velocity of the matter onthe brane equals the rotation metric tensor. For non-perfect dragging, thebehavior of the rotation is strongly equation of state dependent. For someclasses of dense matter, like the stiff causal or the Chaplygin gas, theangular velocity of the matter on the brane is an increasing function of time.For other types of the ultra-dense matter, like the Hagedorn fluid, rotation issmoothed out by the expansion of the Universe. Therefore the study of dynamicsof rotational perturbations of brane world models, as well as in generalrelativity, could provide some insights on the physical properties and equationof state of the cosmological fluid filling the very early Universe.
