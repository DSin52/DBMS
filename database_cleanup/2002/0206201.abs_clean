Title: VEV's and condensates from the Schr\"odinger Wave-functional

Authors: David Nolland

Comments: LaTeX, 9pp

We show how VEV's and condensates can be read off from the Schr\"odingerwave-functional without further calculation. This allows us to studynon-perturbative physics by solving the Schr\"odinger equation. To illustratethe method we calculate fermion condensates from the exact solution of theSchwinger model, and other (1+1) dimensional models. The chiral condensate isseen to be a large-distance effect due to propagators reflecting off thespace-time boundary.
