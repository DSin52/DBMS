In this paper a de Sitter Space version of Black Hole Complementarity isformulated which states that an observer in de Sitter Space describes thesurrounding space as a sealed finite temperature cavity bounded by a horizonwhich allows no loss of information. We then discuss the implications of thisfor the existence of boundary correlators in the hypothesized dS/cftcorrespondence. We find that dS complementarity precludes the existence of theappropriate limits. We find that the limits exist only in approximations inwhich the entropy of the de Sitter Space is infinite. The reason that thecorrelators exist in quantum field theory in the de Sitter Space background istraced to the fact that horizon entropy is infinite in QFT.
