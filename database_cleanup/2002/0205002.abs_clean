We describe a global approach to the study of duality transformations betweenantisymmetric fields with transitions and argue that the natural geometricalsetting for the approach is that of gerbes, these objects are mathematicalconstructions generalizing U(1) bundles and are similarly classified byquantized charges. We address the duality maps in terms of the potentialsrather than on their field strengths and show the quantum equivalence betweendual theories which in turn allows a rigorous proof of a generalized Diracquantization condition on the couplings. Our approach needs the introduction ofan auxiliary form satisfying a global constraint which in the case of 1-formpotentials coincides with the quantization of the magnetic flux. We apply ourglobal approach to refine the proof of the duality equivalence between d=11supermembrane and d=10 IIA Dirichlet supermembrane.
