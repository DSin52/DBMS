9+1 dimensional spaceAuthors: J. Besprosvany

Comments: 13 pages, Fig. 1(a)-(d)

We consider a Dirac equation set on an extended spin space that containsfermion and boson solutions. At given dimension, it determines the scalarsymmetries. The standard field equations can be equivalently written in termsof such degrees of freedom, and are similarly constrained. At 9+1 dimensions,the SU(3) X SU(2)_L X U(1) gauge groups emerge, as well as solutionrepresentations with quantum numbers of related gauge bosons, leptons, quarks,Higgs-like particles and others as lepto-quarks. Information on the couplingconstants is also provided; e. g., for the hypercharge g'=(1/2) sqrt(3/5) ~>.387, at tree level.
