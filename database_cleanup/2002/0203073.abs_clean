We investigate the issues of unitarity and reality of the spectrum for theimaginary coupled affine Toda field theories based on a_1(1) and a_2(2) and theperturbed minimal models that arise from their various RSOS restrictions. Weshow that while all theories based on a_1(1) have real spectra in finitevolume, the spectra of a_2(2) models is in general complex, with someexceptions. We also correct the S matrices conjectured earlier for the phi(1,5)perturbations of minimal models and give evidence for a conjecture that theRSOS spectra can be obtained as suitable projections of the folded ATFTs infinite volume.
