We give examples of string compactifications to 4d Minkowski space withdifferent amounts of supersymmetry that can be connected by spherical domainwalls. The tension of these domain walls is tunably lower than the 4d Planckscale. The ``stringy'' description of these walls is known in terms of certainconfigurations of wrapped Dirichlet and NS branes. This construction allows usto connect a variety of vacua with 4d N=4,3,2,1 supersymmetry.
