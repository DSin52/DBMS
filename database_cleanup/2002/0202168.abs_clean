Compactifications of type II theories on Calabi-Yau threefolds includingelectric and magnetic background fluxes are discussed. We derive the bosonicpart of the four-dimensional low energy effective action and show that it is anon-canonical N=2 supergravity which includes a massive two-form. Thesymplectic invariance of the theory is maintained as long as the fluxparameters transform as a symplectic vector and a massive two-form whichcouples to both electric and magnetic field strengths is present. The mirrorsymmetry between type IIA and type IIB compactified on mirror manifolds isshown to hold for R-R fluxes at the level of the effective action. We alsocompactify type IIA in the presence of NS three-form flux but the mirrorsymmetry in this case remains unclear.
