Maxwell-Chern-Simons models in the presence of an instanton anti-instantonbackground are studied. The saddle-point configuration corresponds to thecreation and annihilation of a vortex localized around the Dirac string neededto support the nontrivial background. This configuration is generalized to thecase in which a nonlocal Maxwell term is allowed in order to fulfill the finiteaction requirement. Following 't Hooft procedure, we compute the vortexcorrelation functions and we study the possibility of obtaining spin 1/2excitations. A possible connection with the bosonization of interactingthree-dimensional massive fermionic systems is also discussed.
