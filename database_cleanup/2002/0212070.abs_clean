four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theoriesAuthors: Friedemann Brandt

Comments: 45 pages

The local cohomology of an extended BRST differential which includes globalN=1 supersymmetry and Poincare transformations is completely and explicitlycomputed in four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories withsuper-Yang-Mills multiplets, chiral matter multiplets and linear multipletscontaining 2-form gauge potentials. In particular we determine to first orderall N=1 supersymmetric and Poincare invariant consistent deformations of thesetheories that preserve the N=1 supersymmetry algebra on-shell modulo gaugetransformations, and all Poincare invariant candidate gauge and supersymmetryanomalies. When the Yang-Mills gauge group is semisimple and no linearmultiplets are present, we find that all such deformations can be constructedfrom standard superspace integrals and preserve the supersymmetrytransformations in a formulation with auxiliary fields, and the candidateanomalies are exhausted by supersymmetric generalizations of the well-knownchiral anomalies. In the general case there are additional deformations andcandidate anomalies which are relevant especially to the deformation of freetheories and the general classification of interaction terms in supersymmetricfield theories.
