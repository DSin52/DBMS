Modeling the potential by an inverse square law in terms of the tachyon field($V(T)=\beta T^{-2}$) we find exact solution for spatially flat isotropicuniverse.We show that for $\beta>2\sqrt{3}/3$ the model undergoes power-lawinflation. A way to construct other exact solutions is specified andexemplified.
