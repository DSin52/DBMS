Noncommutative version of D-dimensional relativistic particle is proposed. Weconsider the particle interacting with the configuration space variable$\theta^{\mu\nu}(\tau)$ instead of the numerical matrix. The correspondingPoincare invariant action has a local symmetry, which allows one to impose thegauge $\theta^{0i}=0, ~ \theta^{ij}=const$. The matrix $\theta^{ij}$ turns outto be the noncommutativity parameter of the gauge fixed formulation. Poincaretransformations of the gauge fixed formulation are presented in the manifestform. Consistent coupling of NC relativistic particle to the electromagneticfield is constructed and discussed.
