A bound state problem in a topologically massive quantum electrodynamics isinvestigated by using a non-perturbative method. We formulate the Bethe-Salpeter equation for scalar bound states composed of massive fermion andanti-fermion pair under the lowest ladder approximation. In a large massexpansion for the (anti-) fermion, we derive the Schr{\"o}dinger equation andsolve it by a numerical method. The energy eigenvalues of bound states areevaluated for various values of a topological mass and also a fermion mass.Then we find a novel logarithmic scaling behaviour of the binding energy invarying the topological mass, fermion mass and also a quantum number. Thereexists a critical value of the topological mass, beyond which the bound statesdisappear. As the topological mass decreases, the energy eigenvalues of thebound states, which are negative, also decrease with a logarithmic dependenceon the topological mass. A Chern-Simons term gives the bound system a repulsiveeffect.
