Title: A Note on Strings in a Rindler Background

Authors: Sudarshan Ananth

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX; typos corrected

We study bosonic strings in a Rindler background using a D-23 brane. Thismodel is shown to be directly related to the orbifold approach to Rindlerstrings. We propose a duality between these pictures based on comparisons oftheir closed string spectra.
