Solvable and Integrable SystemsWe investigate a U(1) gauge invariant quantum mechanical system on a 2Dnoncommutative space with coordinates generating a generalized deformedoscillator algebra. The Hamiltonian is taken as a quadratic form in gaugecovariant derivatives obeying the nonlinear Dolan-Grady relations. Thisrestricts the structure function of the deformed oscillator algebra to aquadratic polynomial. The cases when the coordinates form the su(2) and sl(2,R)algebras are investigated in detail. Reducing the Hamiltonian to 1Dfinite-difference quasi-exactly solvable operators, we demonstrate partialalgebraization of the spectrum of the corresponding systems on the fuzzy sphereand noncommutative hyperbolic plane. A completely covariant method based on thenotion of intrinsic algebra is proposed to deal with the spectral problem ofsuch systems.
