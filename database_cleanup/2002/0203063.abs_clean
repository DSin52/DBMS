When a quantum field theory possesses topological excitations in a phase withspontaneously broken symmetry, these are created by operators which arenon-local with respect to the order parameter. Due to non-locality, suchdisorder operators have non-trivial correlation functions even in free massivetheories. In two dimensions, these correlators can be expressed exactly interms of solutions of non-linear differential equations. The correlationfunctions of the one-parameter family of non-local operators in the freecharged bosonic and fermionic models are the inverse of each other. We pointout a simple derivation of this correspondence within the form factor approach
