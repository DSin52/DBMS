Title: Towards a new quantization of Dirac's monopole

Authors: A.I. Nesterov and F. Aceves de la Cruz

Comments: To appear in Proceedings of "IV Taller de la Division de Gravitacion

y Fisica Matematica". Misprints corrected, references and acknowledgmentsaddedThere are several mathematical and physical reasons why Dirac's quantizationmust hold. How far one can go without it remains an open problem. The presentwork outlines a few steps in this direction.
