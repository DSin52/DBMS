Title: Spacetime Dependent Lagrangians and the Vacuum Expectation Value of the

Higgs fieldAuthors: R.Bhattacharyya, Debashis Gangopadhyay

Comments: latex, 10 pages

The spacetime dependent lagrangian formalism of references [1-2] is used toobtain a classical solution of Yang-Mills theory. This is then used to obtainan estimate of the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, viz.$\phi_{a}=A/e$, where $A$ is a constant and $e$ is the Yang-Mills coupling(related to the usual electric charge). The solution can also accommodatenon-commuting coordinates on the boundary of the theory which may be used toconstruct D-brane actions.
