We study the potential induced by imaginary self-dual 3-forms incompactifications of string theory and the cosmological evolution associatedwith it. The potential contains exponentials of the volume moduli of thecompactification, and we demonstrate that the exponential form of the potentialleads to a power law for the scale factor of the universe. This power law doesnot support accelerated expansion. We explain this result in terms ofsupersymmetry and comment on corrections to the potential that could lead toinflation or quintessence.
