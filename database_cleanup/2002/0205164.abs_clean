We calculate the correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula forfive dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black holes due to thermodynamicfluctuations. The result is then compared with the boundary gauge theoryentropy corrections via AdS/CFT correspondence. We then further generalise ouranalysis for the rotating black hole in five dimensional AdS space.
