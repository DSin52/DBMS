typos corrected and references added; discussion of the link with Deligne'sconjecture expandedWe discuss the q-state Potts models for q<=4, in the scaling regimes close totheir critical or tricritical points. Starting from the kink S-matrix elementsproposed by Chim and Zamolodchikov, the bootstrap is closed for the scalingregions of all critical points, and for the tricritical points when 4>q>=2. Wealso note a curious appearance of the extended last line of Freudenthal's magicsquare in connection with the Potts models.
