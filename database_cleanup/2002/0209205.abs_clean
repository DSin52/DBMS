We construct five different two-parameter massive deformations of the uniquenine-dimensional N=2 supergravity. All of these deformations have ahigher-dimensional origin via Scherk-Schwarz reduction and correspond to gaugedsupergravities. The gauge groups we encounter are SO(2), SO(1,1)^+, R, R^+ andthe two-dimensional non-Abelian Lie group A(1), which consists of scalings andtranslations in one dimension.We make a systematic search for half-supersymmetric domain walls andnon-supersymmetric de Sitter space solutions. Furthermore, we discuss in whichsense the supergravities we have constructed can be considered as low-energylimits of compactified superstring theory.
