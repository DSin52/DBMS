The cosmological effects of the tachyon rolling down to its ground state arediscussed by coupling a simple effective field theory for the tachyon field toEinstein gravity. As the tachyon rolls down to the minimum of its potential theuniverse expands. Depending upon initial conditions, the scale factor may ormay not start off accelerating, but ultimately it ceases to do so and the finalflat spacetime is either static in the rest frame of the tachyon (if $k=0$) or(if $k=-1$) given by the Milne model.
