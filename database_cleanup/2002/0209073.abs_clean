Title: Additional considerations in the definition and renormalization of

(17)-(18) added; minor additional changes; This version to appear in MPLAIn this work, we pursue further consequences of a general formalism fornon-covariant gauges developed in an earlier work (hep-th/0205042). We carryout further analysis of the additional restrictions on renormalizations notedin that work. We use the example of the axial gauge A_3=0. We find that ifmultiplicative renormalization together with ghost-decoupling is to hold, the``prescription-term'' (that defines a prescription) cannot be chosenarbitrarily but has to satisfy certain non-trivial conditions (over and abovethose implied by the validity of power counting) arising from the WT identitiesassociated with the residual gauge invariance. We also give a restricted classof solutions to these conditions.
