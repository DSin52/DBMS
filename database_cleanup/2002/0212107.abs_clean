clarifications added. Version published in JHEPIn this paper we generalize the O(p+1,p+1) solution generating technique(this is a method used to deform Dp-branes by turning on a NS-NS B-field) toM-theory, in order to be able to deform M5-brane supergravity solutionsdirectly in eleven dimensions, by turning on a non zero three form A. We findthat deforming the M5-brane, in some cases, corresponds to performing certainSL(2,R) transformations of the Kahler structure parameter for the three-torus,on which the M5-brane has been compactified. We show that this new M-theorysolution generating technique can be reduced to the O(p+1,p+1) solutiongenerating technique with p=4. Further, we find that it implies that the openmembrane metric and generalized noncommutativity parameter are manifestlydeformation independent for electric and light-like deformations. We alsogeneralize the O(p+1,p+1) method to the type IIA/B NS5-brane in order to beable to deform NS5-branes with RR three and two forms, respectively. In thetype IIA case we use the newly obtained solution generating technique anddeformation independence to derive a covariant expression for an open D2-branecoupling, relevant for OD2-theory.
