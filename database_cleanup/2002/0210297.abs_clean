GeometryThe Dirac operator for a manifold $Q$, and its chirality operator when $Q$ iseven dimensional, have a central role in noncommutative geometry. Wesystematically develop the theory of this operator when $Q=G/H$, where $G$ and$H$ are compact connected Lie groups and $G$ is simple. An elementarydiscussion of the differential geometric and bundle theoretic aspects of $G/H$,including its projective modules and complex, K\"ahler and Riemannianstructures, is presented for this purpose. An attractive feature of ourapproach is that it transparently shows obstructions to spin- andspin$_c$-structures. When a manifold is spin$_c$ and not spin, U(1) gaugefields have to be introduced in a particular way to define spinors. Likewise,for manifolds like $SU(3)/SO(3)$, which are not even spin$_c$, we show thatSU(2) and higher rank gauge fields have to be introduced to define spinors.This result has potential consequences for string theories if such manifoldsoccur as $D$-branes. The spectra and eigenstates of the Dirac operator onspheres $S^n=SO(n+1)/SO(n)$, invariant under $SO(n+1)$, are explicitly found.Aspects of our work overlap with the earlier research of Cahen et al..
