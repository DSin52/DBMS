We deform the AdS/CFT Correspondence by the inclusion of a non-supersymmetricscalar mass operator. We discuss the behaviour of the dual 5 dimensionalsupergravity field then lift the full solution to 10 dimensions. Brane probingthe resulting background reveals a potential consistent with the operator wewished to insert.
