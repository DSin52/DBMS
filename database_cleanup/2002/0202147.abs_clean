the 11th Workshop on General Relativity and Gravitation held at WasedaUniversity in Japan during Jan. 9-12, 2002Some issues on the stability of black string or brane solutions aresummarized briefly. The stability of dS/AdS-Schwarzschild black strings hasbeen investigated. Interestingly, the AdS-Schwarzschild black strings turn outto be stable as the horizon size becomes larger than the AdS scale. It is alsoshown that BTZ black strings in four dimensions are stable regardless of thehorizon size. Such stable feature seems to be common for several known blackstrings in dimensions lower than five. Some implications of our results on therole of non-uniformity in stable black string configurations are alsodiscussed.
