Title: Photon as the magnetic monopole

Authors: Sze Kui Ng

Comments: 12 pages

In this paper we reinvestigate photon. We show that photon can be identifiedwith the Dirac magnetic monopole. We give a model of quantum electrodynamicsfrom which we derive photon as a quantum loop of this model. This nonlinearloop model of photon is exactly solvable and thus may be regarded as a quantumsoliton. From the winding numbers of this loop model of photon we derive thequantization property of energy of Planck's formula of radiation and thequantization property of electric charge. We show that these two quantizationsare just the same quantization when photon is identified with the magneticmonopole. From this nonlinear model of photon we also construct a model ofelectron which has a mass mechanism for generating mass to electron.
