We investigate maximally symmetric backgrounds in nonsupersymmetric stringvacua with D-branes and O-planes localized in the compact space. We find aclass of solutions with a perturbative string coupling constant in all regionsof spacetime. Depending on the particular model, we find either a timeevolution with a big-bang type singularity or a space dependent background withgenerically orbifold singularities. We show that the result can be interpretedas a supersymmetric bulk with some symmetries broken by the boundaries. We alsodiscuss an interesting connection to Lorentzian and Euclidian orbifolds.
