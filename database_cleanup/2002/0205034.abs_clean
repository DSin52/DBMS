We compute the non-holomorphic corrections to low-energy effective action(higher derivative terms) in N=2, SU(2) SYM theory coupled to hypermultipletson a non-abelian background for a class of gauge fixing conditions. A generalprocedure for calculating the gauge parameters depending contributions toone-loop superfield effective action is developed. The one-loop non-holomorphiceffective potential is exactly found in terms of Euler dilogarithm function forspecific choice of gauge parameters.
