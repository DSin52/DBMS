We construct logarithmic conformal field theories starting from an ordinaryconformal field theory -- with a chiral algebra C and the corresponding spacerepresentation on V\tensor End K[[z,1/z]], where K is an auxiliaryfinite-dimensional vector space, and ii) extending C by operators correspondingto the endomorphisms End K. For K=C^2, with End K being the two-dimensionalClifford algebra, our construction results in extending C by an operator thatcan be thought of as \partial^{-1}E, where \oint E is a fermionic screening.This covers the (2,p) Virasoro minimal models as well as the sl(2) WZW theory.
