We compute the O(1/N) correction to the stability critical exponent, omega,in the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson model with O(N) x O(m) symmetry at the stablechiral fixed point and the stable direction at the unstable antichiral fixedpoint. Several constraints on the O(1/N) coefficients of the four loopperturbative beta-functions are computed.
