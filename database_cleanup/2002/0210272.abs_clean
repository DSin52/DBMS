We discuss the holographic principle in a radiation-dominated, closedFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe with a positive cosmologicalconstant. By introducing a cosmological D-bound on entropy of matter in theuniverse, we can write the Friedmann equation governing evolution of theuniverse in the form of Cardy formula. When the cosmological D-bound issaturated, the Friedmann equation coincides with the Cardy-Verlinde formuladescribing entropy of radiation in the universe. As a concrete model, weconsider the brane cosmology in the background of Schwarzschild-de Sitter blackholes. It is found that the cosmological D-bound is saturated when the branecrosses the black hole horizon of the background. At that moment, the Friedmannequation coincides with the Cardy-Verlinde formula describing the entropy ofradiation matter on the brane.
