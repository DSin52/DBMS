Title: Probe Branes Dynamics in Nonconstant Background Fields

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX, no figures. Talk at First Advanced Research Workshop

on Gravity, Astrophysics, and Strings at the Black Sea, Kiten, June 10-16,2002, Bulgaria. To be published in the proceedingsWe consider probe p-branes dynamics in string theory backgrounds of generaltype. We use an action, which interpolates between Nambu-Goto and Polyakov typeactions. This allows us to give a unified description for the tensile andtensionless branes. Firstly, we perform our analysis in the frequently usedstatic gauge. Then, we obtain exact brane solutions in more general gauges. Thesame approach is used to study the Dirichlet p-brane dynamics and here exactsolutions are also found. As an illustration, we apply our results to the braneworld scenario in the framework of the mirage cosmology approach.
