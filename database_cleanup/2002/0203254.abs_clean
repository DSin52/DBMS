Authors: Merab Gogberashvili

Comments: 3 pages, LaTeX, no figures

Recently by us was proposed the model where Einstein's equation on the branewas connected with Maxwell's multi-dimensional equations in pseudo-Euclideanspace. Based on this idea unification of 4-dimensional gravity andelectromagnetism in (2+4)-space is found. In this picture photon is massless infour dimensions and obtains large mass in extra (1+1)-space normal to thebrane.
