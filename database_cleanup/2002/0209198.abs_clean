EffectNoncommutative geometry governs the physics of quantum Hall (QH) effects. Weintroduce the Weyl ordering of the second quantized density operator to explorethe dynamics of electrons in the lowest Landau level. We analyze QH systemsmade of $N$-component electrons at the integer filling factor $\nu=k\leq N$.The basic algebra is the SU(N)-extended W$_{\infty}$. A specific feature isthat noncommutative geometry leads to a spontaneous development of SU(N)quantum coherence by generating the exchange Coulomb interaction. The effectiveHamiltonian is the Grassmannian $G_{N,k}$ sigma model, and the dynamical fieldis the Grassmannian $G_{N,k}$ field, describing $k(N-k)$ complex Goldstonemodes and one kind of topological solitons (Grassmannian solitons).
