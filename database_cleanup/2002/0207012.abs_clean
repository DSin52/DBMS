Boundary S matrices for the boundary tricritical Ising field theory (TIM),both with and without supersymmetry, have previously been proposed. Here weprovide support for these S matrices by showing that the corresponding boundaryentropies are consistent with the expected boundary flows. We develop thefusion procedure for boundary RSOS models, with which we derive exact inversionidentities for the TIM. We confirm the TBA description of nonsupersymmetricboundary flows of Lesage et al., and we obtain corresponding descriptions ofsupersymmetric boundary flows.
