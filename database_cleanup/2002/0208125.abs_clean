proceedings of Beyond the Desert 02 - Accelerator and non AcceleratorApproaches, Oulu, Finland, 2-7 June 2002The Standard Model data suggests the realization of grand unificationstructures in nature, in particular that of SO(10). A class of string vacuathat preserve the SO(10) embedding, are the three generation free fermionheterotic-string models, that are related to Z2xZ2 orbifold compactification.Attempts to use the M-theory framework to explore further this class of modelsare discussed. Wilson line breaking of the SO(10) GUT symmetry results insuper-heavy meta-stable states, which produce several exotic dark matter andUHECR candidates, with differing phenomenological characteristics. Attempts todevelop the tools to study the properties of these states in forthcoming UHECRexperiments are discussed. It is proposed that quantum mechanics arises from anequivalence postulate, that may lay the foundations for the rigorousformulation of quantum gravity.
