Title: Gauge Invariance and Duality in the Noncommutative Plane

Authors: Subir Ghosh (Indian Statistical Institute)

Comments: Section added showing the duality to be valid to all orders in the

noncommutative parameter. Paper to appear in Phys.Lett.BWe show that the duality between the self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-Simonstheories in 2+1-dimensions survives when the space-time becomes noncommutative.Existence of the Seiberg-Witten map is crucial in the present analysis. Itshould be noted that the above models, being manifestly gauge variant andinvariant respectively, transform differently under the Seiberg-Witten map. Wealso discuss this duality in the Stuckelberg formalism where the self-dualmodel is elevated to a gauge theory. The "`master"' lagrangian approach hasbeen followed throughout.
