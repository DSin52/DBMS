Using the data of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Neumann matrices in the3-string vertex, we prove analytically that the ghost kinetic operator ofvacuum string field theory obtained by Hata and Kawano is equal to the ghostoperator inserted at the open string midpoint. We also comment on the values ofdeterminants appearing in the norm of sliver state.
