Title: Finite size effects and the supersymmetric sine-Gordon models

Authors: Clare Dunning

Comments: 12 pages and no figures

We propose nonlinear integral equations to describe the groundstate energy ofthe fractional supersymmetric sine-Gordon models. The equations encompass theN=1 supersymmetric sine-Gordon model as well as the phi_(id,id,adj)perturbation of the SU(2)_L x SU(2)_K /SU(2)_(L+K) models at rational level K.A second set of equations are proposed for the groundstate energy of the N=2supersymmetric sine-Gordon model.
