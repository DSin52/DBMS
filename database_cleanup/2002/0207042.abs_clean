addedIn the framework of brane models the postulates of special relativity theoryis revised. It is assumed that there exists preferred frame and relativityprinciple is violated on the brane. Because of trapping any moving object onthe brane is really accelerated and the formulas for gravitational contractionof the intervals (containing the escape speed) appears to be equivalent toordinary Lorentz ones.
