Global geometric properties of dS space are presented explicitly in variouscoordinates. A Robertson-Walker like metric is deduced, which is convenient tobe used in study of dynamics in dS space. Singularities of wavefunctions ofmassive scalar fields at boundary are demonstrated. A bulk-boundary propagatoris constructed by making use of the solutions of equations of motion. ThedS/CFT correspondence and the Strominger's mass bound is shown.
