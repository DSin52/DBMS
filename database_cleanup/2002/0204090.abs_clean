We study the renormalisation group flows between minimal W models by means ofa new set of nonlinear integral equations which provide access to the effectivecentral charge of both unitary and nonunitary models. We show that the scalingfunction associated to the nonunitary models is a nonmonotonic function of thesystem size.
