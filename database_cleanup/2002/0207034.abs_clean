We study the spectrum of the recently proposed matrix model of DLCQ M-theoryin a parallel plane (pp)-wave background. In contrast to matrix theory in aflat background this model contains mass terms, which lift the flat directionsof the potential and renders its spectrum discrete. The supersymmetry algebraof the model groups the energy eigenstates into supermultiplets, whose membersdiffer by fixed amounts of energy in great similarity to the representation ofsupersymmetry in AdS spaces. There is a unique and exact zero-energygroundstate along with a multitude of long and short multiplets of excitedstates. For large masses the quantum mechanical model may be treatedperturbatively and we study the leading order energy shifts of the firstexcited states up to level two. Most interestingly we uncover a protected shortmultiplet at level two, whose energies do not receive perturbative corrections.Moreover, we conjecture the existence of an infinite series of similarprotected multiplets in the pp-wave matrix model.
