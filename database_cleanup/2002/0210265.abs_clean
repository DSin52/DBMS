We determine the Killing spinors for a class of magnetic brane solutions withMinkowski worldvolume of the theory of AdS Einstein Maxwell theories in ddimensions. We also obtain curved magnetic brane solutions with Ricci-flatworldvolumes. If we demand that the curved brane solution admits Killingspinors, then its worldvolume must admit parallel spinors. Classes ofRicci-flat worldvolumes admitting parallel spinors are discussed.
