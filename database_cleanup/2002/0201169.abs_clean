We begin with an effective string theory for long distance QCD, and evaluatethe semiclassical expansion of this theory about a classical rotating stringsolution, taking into account the the dynamics of the boundary of the string.We show that, after renormalization, the zero point energy of the stringfluctuations remains finite when the masses of the quarks on the ends of thestring approach zero. The theory is then conformally invariant in any spacetimedimension D. For D=26 the energy spectrum of the rotating string formallycoincides with that of the open string in classical Bosonic string theory.However, its physical origin is different. It is a semiclassical spectrum of aneffective string theory valid only for large values of the angular momentum.For D=4, the first semiclassical correction adds the constant 1/12 to theclassical Regge formula.
