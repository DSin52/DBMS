We extract from gauge theoretical calculations the matrix elements of the SYMdilatation operator. By the BMN correspondence this should coincide with the3-string vertex of light cone string field theory in the pp-wave background. Wefind a mild but important discrepancy with the SFT results. If the modified$O(g_2)$ matrix elements are used, the $O(g_2^2)$ anomalous dimensions areexactly reproduced without the need for a contact interaction in the singlestring sector.
