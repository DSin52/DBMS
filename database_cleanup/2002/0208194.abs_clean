We discuss the application of the deformation quantization approach toperturbative quantum field theory. We show that the various forms of Wick'stheorem are a direct consequence of the structure of the star products. Wederive the scattering function for a free scalar field in interaction with aspacetime-dependent source. We show that the translation to operator formalismreproduces the known relations which lead to the derivation of the Feynmanrules.
