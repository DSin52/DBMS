We describe the effective supergravity theory present below the scale ofspontaneous gauge symmetry breaking due to an anomalous U(1), obtained byintegrating out tree-level interactions of massive modes. A simple case isexamined in some detail. We find that the effective theory can be expressed inthe linear multiplet formulation, with some interesting consequences. Amongthem, the modified linearity conditions lead to new interactions not present inthe theory without an anomalous U(1). These additional interactions arecompactly expressed through a superfield functional.
