We find a new Penrose limit of AdS_5*S^5 that gives the maximally symmetricpp-wave background of type IIB string theory in a coordinate system that has amanifest space-like isometry. This induces a new pp-wave/gauge-theory dualitywhich on the gauge theory side involves a novel scaling limit of N=4 SYMtheory. The new Penrose limit, when applied to AdS_5*S^5/Z_M, yields a pp-wavewith a space-like circle. The dual gauge theory description involves a triplescaling limit of an N=2 quiver gauge theory. We present in detail the mapbetween gauge theory operators and string theory states including windingstates, and verify agreement between the energy eigenvalues obtained fromstring theory and those computed in gauge theory, at least to one-loop order inthe planar limit. We furthermore consider other related new Penrose limits andexplain how these limits can be understood as part of a more general framework.
