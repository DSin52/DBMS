Title: On the quantum theory of pure gravitation

Authors: B. Ram

Comments: 9 pages

A quantum theory of the region of pure gravitation was given earlier in twopapers [gr-qc/9908036 (Phys. Lett. A {\bf {265}}, 1 (2000)); gr-qc/0101056]. Inthis paper I provide further insight into the physics of this region.
