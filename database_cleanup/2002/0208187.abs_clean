We study supergravity solutions of Dp-branes in the time-dependent orbifoldbackground. We show that worldvolume theories decouple from the bulk gravityfor p less than six. Along AdS/CFT correspondence, these solutions couldprovide the gravity description of noncommutative field theory withtime-dependent noncommutative parameter. Type II NS5-brane (M5-brane) in thepresence of RR n-form for n=0,..., 4 (C field) in this time-dependentbackground have also been studied.
