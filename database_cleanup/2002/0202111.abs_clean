We investigate the Penrose limits of classical string and M-theorybackgrounds. We prove that the number of (super)symmetries of a supergravitybackground never decreases in the limit. We classify all the possible Penroselimits of AdS x S spacetimes and of supergravity brane solutions. We alsosupersymmetric black holes and strings in diverse dimensions, and cosmologicalmodels. We explore the Penrose limit of an isometrically embedded spacetime andfind a generalisation to spaces with more than one time. Finally, we show thatthe Penrose limit is a large tension limit for all branes including those withfields of Born--Infeld type.
