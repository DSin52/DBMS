The new first order, rheonomic, kappa-supersymmetric formalism recentlyintroduced by us for the world-volume action of the D3-brane is extended to thecase of D5-branes. This extension requires the dual formulation of the FreeDifferential Algebra of type IIB supergravity in terms of 6-form gaugepotentials which was so far missing and is given here. Furthermore relying onour new approach we are able to write the D5-world volume action in amanifestly SL(2,R) covariant form. This is important in order to solve theoutstanding problem of finding the appropriate boundary actions of D3-branes onsmooth ALE manifolds with twisted fields. The application of our results tothis problem is however postponed to a subsequent publication.
