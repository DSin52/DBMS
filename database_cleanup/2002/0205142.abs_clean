We compute the quasinormal modes associated with decay of the massless scalarfiled around a small Schwarzschild-Anti-de-Sitter black hole. The computationsshows that when the horizon radius is much less than the anti-de-Sitter radius,the imaginary part of the frequency goes to zero as $r_+^{d-2}$ while the realpart of $\omega$ decreases to its minimum and then goes to $d-1$. Thus thequasinormal modes approach the usual AdS modes in the limit $r_+ -> 0$. Thisagrees with suggestions of Horowitz et al (Phys.Rev. D62 024027 (2000)).
