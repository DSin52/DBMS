Title: Duality in N=1 Supersymmetric gauge theories and recent developments

Comments: 11 pages, to appear in the Proceedings of "HEP-MAD'01

High-Energy Physics Conference In Madagascar", 27 Sep - 5 Oct 2001,Antananarivo, MadagascarWe discuss a number of exact results in N=1 supersymmetric field theories. Wereview the results obtained by Seiberg in Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theories withmatter in fundamental representation. We then consider Kutasov-type SYMtheories, which also contain matter in the adjoint representation and anappropriate tree--level superpotential. We finally focus on one particular casein the latter theories, a generalization of the theories with equal number offlavors and colors studied by Seiberg, in which non--trivial superconformaltheories appear at certain sections of the quantum--modified moduli space.Throughout the paper we stress the role played by duality in the search forexact results.
