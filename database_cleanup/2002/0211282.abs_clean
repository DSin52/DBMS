Dynamics of confining vacua which appear as deformed superconformal theorywith a non-Abelian gauge symmetry, is studied by taking a concrete example ofthe sextet vacua of ${\cal N}=2$, SU(3) gauge theory with $n_f=4$, with equalquark masses. We show that the low-energy "matter" degrees of freedom of thistheory consist of four magnetic monopole doublets of the low-energy effectiveSU(2) gauge group, one dyon doublet, and one electric doublet. We find amechanism of cancellation of the beta function, which naturally butnontrivially generalizes that of Argyres-Douglas. Study of our SCFT theory as alimit of six colliding ${\cal N}=1$ vacua, suggests that the confinement in thepresent theory occurs in an essentially different manner from those vacua withdynamical Abelianization, and involves strongly interacting non-Abelianmagnetic monopoles.
