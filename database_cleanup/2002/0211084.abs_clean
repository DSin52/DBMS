Title: Anomalies in quantum field theory

Authors: Elisabeth Kraus

Comments: Talk presented at the Hesselberg workshop 2002 "Renormalization and

regularization"We consider the Adler-Bardeen anomaly of the U(1) axial current in abelianand non-abelian gauge theories and present its algebraic characterization aswell as an explicit evaluation proving regularization scheme independence ofthe anomaly. By extending the gauge coupling to an external space-timedependent field we get a unique definition for the quantum corrections of thetopological term. It also implies a simple proof of the non-renormalizationtheorem of the Adler-Bardeen anomaly. We consider local gauge couplings insupersymmetric theories and find that there the renormalization of the gaugecoupling is determined by the topological term in all loop orders except forone loop. It is shown that in one-loop order the quantum corrections to thetopological term induce an anomalous breaking of supersymmetry, which ischaracterized by similar properties as the Adler-Bardeen anomaly.
