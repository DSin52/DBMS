The embedding of a thick de Sitter 3-brane into a five-dimensional bulk isstudied, assuming a scalar field with potential is present in the bulk. A classof solutions is found in closed form that can represent a thick de Sitter3-brane interpolating either between two dynamical black holes with a $R \timesS_{4}$ topology or between two Rindler-like spacetimes with a $R_{2}\timesS_{3}$ topology. The gravitational field is localized in a small region nearthe center of the 3-brane. The analysis of graviton fluctuations shows that azero mode exists and separates itself from a set of continuous modes by a massgap. The existence of such a mass gap is shown to be universal. The scalarperturbations are also studied and shown to be stable.
