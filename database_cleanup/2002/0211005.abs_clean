temperatureComments: 9 pages, LaTeX2e, uses sc3con.sty. Contribution to the Proceedings of

the Third Sakharov Conference on Physics (Moscow, Lebedev Institute, June 24- 29, 2002)The survey summarizes briefly the results obtained recently in the Casimircharacteristics of the media and their influence on the vacuum energy (forexample, dilute dielectric ball); ii) application of the spectral geometrymethods for investigating the vacuum energy of quantized fields with the goalto gain some insight, specifically, in the geometrical origin of thedivergences that enter the vacuum energy and to develop the relevantrenormalization procedure; iii) universal method for calculating the hightemperature dependence of the Casimir energy in terms of heat kernelcoefficients.
