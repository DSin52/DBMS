Title: Effective Lagrangians in Pseudo-Supersymmetry

Authors: Matthias Klein

Comments: Latex, 7 pages; talk given at SUSY'02

I discuss effective field theories of brane-world models where differentsectors break different halves of the extended bulk supersymmetry. It is shownhow to consistently couple N=2 supersymmetric matter to N=1 superfields thatlack N=2 partners but transform in a non-linear representation of the N=2algebra. In particular, I explain how to couple an N=2 vector to N=1 chiralfields such that the second supersymmetry is non-linearly realized. This methodis then used to study systems where different sectors break different halves ofsupersymmetry, which appear naturally in models of intersecting branes.
