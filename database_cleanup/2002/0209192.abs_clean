Title: Quantum Mechanical Mirror Symmetry, D Branes, and B Fields

Authors: Mark A. Stern

Comments: 22 pages

We construct quantum mechanical models which mimic many features of stringtheory. We use these models to gain improved descriptions of B fields andgerbes. We examine analogs of T duality, D branes, and mirror symmetry andderive quantum mechanical analogs of standard phenomena, such as thenoncommutative geometry induced by a B field.
