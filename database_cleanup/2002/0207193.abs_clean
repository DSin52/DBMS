We consider 5-D gravity plus a bulk scalar field and with parallel 3-branesin the case when Hubble root is zero. To construct exact solutions we use theDarboux transformations. To do this we reduce the system of equations whichdescribes 5-D gravity and bulk scalar field to the Schrodinger equation. Thejump conditions at the branes lead to jump potential in the Schrodingerequation so we need to modify usual Darboux-Crum formulas in this case. Usingthis transformation we have constructed new exact solutions of brane equationswhich is some generalization of the Rundall-Sundrum solution.
