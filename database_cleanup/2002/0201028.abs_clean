We study novel type IIB compactifications on the T^6/Z_2 orientifold. Thisgeometry arises in the T-dual description of Type I theory on T^6, and onenormally introduces 16 space-filling D3-branes to cancel the RR tadpoles. Here,we cancel the RR tadpoles either partially or fully by turning on three-formflux in the compact geometry. The resulting (super)potential for moduli iscalculable. We demonstrate that one can find many examples of N=1supersymmetric vacua with greatly reduced numbers of moduli in this system. Afew examples with N>1 supersymmetry or complete supersymmetry breaking are alsodiscussed.
