Title: Group contractions and its consequences upon representations of

different spatial symmetry groupsAuthors: Mauricio Ayala (Universidad de los Andes, Bogota - Colombia), Richard

Haase (Universidad Nacional, Bogota - Colombia)Comments: To be published in the Proceedings of the Summer School "Geometric

and Topological methods for Quantum Field Theory", Villa de Leyva, Colombia(2001)We investigate the group contraction method for various space-time groups,including SO(3)->E_2, SO(3,1)->G_3, SO(5-h,h)->P(3,1) (h=1 or 2), and itsconsequences for representations of these groups. Following strictly quantummechanical procedures we specifically pay attention in the asymptotic limitingprocedure employed in the contraction G -> G', not only to the respectivealgebras but to their representations spaces spanned by the eigenvectors of theCartan subalgebra and the eigenvalues labelling these representation spaces.Where appropriate a physical interpretation is given to the contractionprodecure.
