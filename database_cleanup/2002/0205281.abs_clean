We study the Type IIA NS five-brane wrapped on a Calabi-Yau manifold X in adouble-scaled decoupling limit. We calculate the euclidean partition functionin the presence of a flat RR 3-form field. The classical contribution is givenby a sum over fluxes of the self-dual tensor field which reduces to atheta-function. The quantum contributions are computed using a T-dual IIBbackground where the five-branes are replaced by an ALE singularity. Using thesupergravity effective action we find that the loop corrections to the freeenergy are given by B-model topological string amplitudes. This seems toprovide a direct link between the double-scaled little strings on thefive-brane worldvolume and topological strings. Both the classical and quantumcontributions to the partition function satisfy (conjugate) holomorphic anomalyequations, which explains an observation of Witten relating topological stringtheory to the quantization of three-form fields.
