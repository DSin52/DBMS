We evaluate the fermionic Casimir effect associated with a massive fermionconfined within a planar (d+1) dimensional slab-bag, on which MIT bag modelboundary conditions of standard type, along a single spatial direction, areimposed. A simple and effective method for adding up the zero-point energyeigenvalues, corresponding to a quantum field under the influence of arbitraryboundary conditions, imposed on the field on flat surfaces perpendicular to achosen spatial direction, is proposed. Using this procedure, an analytic resultis obtained, from which small and large fermion mass limits, valid for anarbitrary number of dimensions, are derived. They match some known results inparticular cases. The method can be easily extended to other configurations.
