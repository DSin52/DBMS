A careful reduction of the three-dimensional gravity to the Liouvilledescription is performed, where all gauge fixing and on-shell conditions comefrom the definition of asymptotic de Sitter spaces. The roles of both past andfuture infinities are discussed and the conditions space-time evolution imposeson both Liouville fields are explicited. Space-times which correspond tonon-equivalent profiles of the Liouville field at past and future infinitiesare shown to exist. The qualitative implications of this for any tentative dualtheory are presented.
