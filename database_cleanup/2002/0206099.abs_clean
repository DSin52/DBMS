A Z_2 orbifold compactification of the heterotic string is considered. Theresulting 6D GUT groups can be SO(16) or E_7 times SU(2) plus some hiddensector groups. The N=4 supersymmetry is reduced to N=2. In particular, theSO(16) 6D model with one spinor representation 128 can reduce to the previous5D SO(16) or SO(14) family unification models after compactifying the sixthdimension. To obtain one spinor, we have to take into account the left-overcenter of SO(16). We also comment on the E_7 times SU(2) model.
