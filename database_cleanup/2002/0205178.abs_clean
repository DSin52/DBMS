We investigate for the N = 2 supersymmetry (SUSY) a relation between a vectorsupermultiplet of the linear SUSY and the Volkov-Akulov model of the nonlinearSUSY. We express component fields of the vector supermultiplet in terms ofNambu-Goldstone fermion fields at the leading orders in a SUSY invariant way,and show the vector nature of the U(1) gauge field explicitly. A relation ofthe actions for the two models is also discussed briefly.
