We conjecture a topology changing transition in M-theory on a non-compactasymptotically conical Spin(7) manifold, where a 5-sphere collapses and a CP(2)bolt grows. We argue that the transition may be understood as the condensationof M5-branes wrapping the 5-sphere. Upon reduction to ten dimensions, it has aphysical interpretation as a transition of D6-branes lying on calibratedsubmanifolds of flat space. In yet another guise, it may be seen as a geometrictransition between two phases of type IIA string theory on a G_2 holonomymanifold with either wrapped D6-branes, or background Ramond-Ramond flux. Thisis the first non-trivial example of a topology changing transition with only1/16 supersymmetry.
