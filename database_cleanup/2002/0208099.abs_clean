Chiral p-forms are, in fact, present in many supersymmetric and supergravitymodels in two, six and ten dimensions. In this work, the dual projectionprocedure, which is essentially equivalent to a canonical transformation, isused to diagonalize some theories in D=2 (0-forms). The dual projectionperformed here provides an alternative way of gauging the chiral componentswithout the necessity of constraints. It is shown, through the dual projection,that the nonmover field (the noton) initially introduced by Hull to cancel outthe Siegel anomaly, has non-Abelian, PST and supersymmetric formulations.
