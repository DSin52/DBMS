Title: Clifford Algebra of Spacetime and the Conformal Group

Authors: C. Castro and M. Pavsic

Comments: 13 pages

We demonstrate the emergence of the conformal group SO(4,2) from the Cliffordalgebra of spacetime. A Clifford space (that contains spacetime, in particular)does not contain only points (events), but also lines, surfaces, volumes, etc..All those geometric objects are very elegantly and compactly described by meansof the geometric calculus based on Clifford algebra. A subgroup of the Cliffordalgebra of spacetime is the conformal group SO(4,2) which can naturally begiven the active interpretation. To finalize we show why relativity in Cliffordspaces implies {\it scale} changes of physical objects as a result of freemotion, without the presence of forces, advocated long ago by one of us. Thisrepresents a true {\it dilatational} motion of physical objects in Cliffordspaces.
