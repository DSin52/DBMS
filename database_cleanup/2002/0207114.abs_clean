A conjecture for computing all genus topological closed string amplitudes ontoric local Calabi-Yau threefolds, by interpreting the associated 5-brane webas a Feynman diagram, is given. A propagator and a three point vertex isdefined which allows us to write down the amplitude associated with 5-braneweb. We verify the conjecture that this amplitude is equal to the closed stringpartition function by computing integer invariants for resolved conifold andcertain curves of low degree in local del Pezzo surfaces, local Hirzebruchsurfaces and their various blowups.
