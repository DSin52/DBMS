explanations addedWe study the relation between the Type IIB (NSNS and RR) 2-form fields andthe (complex) gauge coupling constant of the 4D N=2 SU(Nc) super Yang-Millstheory with Nf fundamental matters. We start from the analysis of the D2-braneworld volume theory with heavy Nc quarks on the Nf D6 supergravity background.After a sequence of T- and S-dualities and a likely supposition about thetransformation of the world volume interaction terms, we obtain the 2-forms inthe configuration with Nc D5-branes wrapping on the vanishing two-cycle underthe influence of the background. These 2-forms shows the same behavior as thegauge coupling constant of the 4D N=2 super QCD. The background reduces to theZ_{Nf} orbifold in the twelve-dimensional space-time formally realized byintroducing the two parameters as the additional space coordinates. In the caseof Nf= 2Nc, the gravity solution in this space-time becomes locally AdS_5 timesS^5/Z_2 \times R^2 with the Z_{Nf} orbifold identification and has the constantNSNS 2-form dependent D3-charge, as expected from the M-theory QCDconfiguration. Based on the known exact result, we also discuss thisconfiguration after including the nonperturbative effect.
