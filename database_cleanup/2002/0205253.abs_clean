We advocate a method to improve systematically the self-consistent harmonicapproximation (or the Gaussian approximation), which has been employedextensively in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. Wedemonstrate the {\em convergence} of the method in a model obtained fromdimensional reduction of SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory in $D$ dimensions. Explicitcalculations have been carried out up to the 7th order in the large-N limit,and we do observe a clear convergence to Monte Carlo results. For $D \gtrsim10$ the convergence is already achieved at the 3rd order, which suggests thatthe method is particularly useful for studying the IIB matrix model, aconjectured nonperturbative definition of type IIB superstring theory.
