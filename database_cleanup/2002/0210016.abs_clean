In this letter we study the process of Hawking radiation of a black holeassuming the existence of a limiting physical curvature scale. The particularmodel is constructed using the Limiting Curvature Hypothesis (LCH) and in thecontext of two-dimensional dilaton gravity. The black hole solution exhibitsproperties of the standard Schwarzschild solution at large values of the radialcoordinate. However, near the center, the black hole is nonsingular and themetric becomes that of de Sitter spacetime. The Hawking temperature iscalculated using the method of complex paths. We find that such black holesradiate eternally and never completely evaporate. The final state is aneternally radiating relic, near the fundamental scale, which should make aviable dark matter candidate. We briefly comment on the black hole informationloss problem and the production of such black holes in collider experiments.
