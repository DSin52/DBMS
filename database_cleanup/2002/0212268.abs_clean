schoolThese talks present an overview of a tentative theory of large distancephysics. For each large distance L (in dimensionless units), the theory givesdistances larger than L, string scattering amplitudes at distances smaller thanL. The mechanism of the theory is a certain 2d nonlinear model, thelambda-model, whose target manifold is the manifold of general nonlinear modelsof the worldsurface, the background spacetimes for string scattering. So far,the theory has only been formulated and its basic working described, in generalterms. The theory's only claims to interest at present are matters of generalprinciple. It is a self-contained nonperturbative theory of large distancephysics, operating entirely at large distance. The lambda-model constructs anactual QFT at large distance, a functional integral over spacetime fields. Itconstructs an effective background spacetime for string scattering atrelatively small distances. It is background independent, dynamically. Nothingis adjustable in its formulation. It is a mechanical theory, not an S-matrixtheory. String scattering takes place at small distances within a mechanicallarge distance environment. The lambda-model constructs QFT in a way thatoffers possibilities of novel physical phenomena at large distances. The tasknow is to perform concrete calculations in the lambda-model, to find out if itproduces a physically useful QFT.
