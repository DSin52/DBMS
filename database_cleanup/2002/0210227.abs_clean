Title: Standard-like models from D-branes

Authors: D. Bailin

Comments: LaTeX file, 6 pages, based on talk given at the 1st International

Conference on String Phenomenology, Oxford, July 6 - 11, 2002I describe the main features of new intersecting D4- and D5-brane orbifoldmodels that yield the non-supersymmetric standard model, up to vector-likematter and, in some cases, extra U(1) factors in the gauge group. There aresix-stack D4-brane models that have charged-singlet scalar tachyons and whicheither contain all of the Yukawa couplings to the tachyonic Higgs doublets thatare needed to generate mass terms for the fermions at renormalisable level orpossess an unwanted extra U(1) gauge symmetry after spontaneous symmetrybreaking. In the D5-brane models a minimum of eight stacks is needed.
