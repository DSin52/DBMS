Title: The cosmological constant, neutrino masses and parity symmetry in 6+1

dimensionsAuthors: Jos\'e Antonio Martins Sim\~oes

Comments: 2 pages, 1 figure. Revised version

In this paper we propose that the cosmological constant scale and neutrinohypothesis is implemented in a 6-space dimensional model that restores theparity symmetry. The 6-dimensional parity symmetry gives a natural mechanismfor the smallness of the vacuum energy density.
