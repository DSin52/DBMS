We consider probe p-branes and Dp-branes dynamics in D-dimensional stringtheory backgrounds of general type. Unified description for the tensile andtensionless branes is used. We obtain exact solutions of their equations ofmotion and constraints in static gauge as well as in more general gauges. Theirdynamics in the whole space-time is also analysed and exact solutions arefound.
