We show that Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) can be viewed as a theory withenergy-momentum space being the four dimensional de Sitter space. Differentformulations (bases) of the DSR theory considered so far can be thereforeunderstood as different coordinate systems on this space. The emerginggeometrical picture makes it possible to understand the universality of thenon-commutative structure of space-time of Doubly Special Relativity. Moreover,it suggests how to construct the most natural DSR bases and makes it possibleto address the long standing problem of total momentum of many particle systemsfrom a different perspective.
