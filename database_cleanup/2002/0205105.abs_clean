It is currently believed that the local causality of Quantum Field Theory(QFT) is destroyed by the measurement process. This belief is also based on theEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox and on the so-called Bell's theorem, thatare thought to prove the existence of a mysterious, instantaneous actionbetween distant measurements. However, I have shown recently that the EPRargument is removed, in an interpretation-independent way, by taking intoaccount the fact that the Standard Model of Particle Physics prevents theproduction of entangled states with a definite number of particles. This resultis used here to argue in favor of a statistical interpretation of QFT and toshow that it allows for a full reconciliation with locality and causality.Within such an interpretation, as Ballentine and Jarret pointed out long ago,Bell's theorem does not demonstrate any nonlocality.
