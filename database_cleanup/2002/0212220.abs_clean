Title: Thermal Instabilities and the "g"-Theorem

We clarify the recent proposal that the vacuum degeneracy "g" of a noncompactworldsheet sigma model with a continuous spectrum of scaling dimensions islowered under renormalization group flow while preserving the central charge.As an illustration we show that a relevant flow of the worldsheet RG induced bya thermal perturbation of the unstable thermal vacuum of the type II string isthe noncompact supersymmetric vacuum with lower "g". Our analysis providesnonperturbative confirmation of a conjecture due to Adams, Polchinski, andSilverstein (APS) and its extension in the work of Harvey, Kutasov, Martinec,and Moore (HKMM).
