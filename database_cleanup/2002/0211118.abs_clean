We discuss the mathematical properties of six--dimensional non--K\"ahlermanifolds which occur in the context of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric heteroticand type IIA string compactifications with non--vanishing background H--field.The intrinsic torsion of the associated SU(3) structures falls into fivedifferent classes. For heterotic compactifications we present an explicitdictionary between the supersymmetry conditions and these five torsion classes.We show that the non--Ricci flat Iwasawa manifold solves the supersymmetryconditions with non--zero H--field, so that it is a consistent heteroticsupersymmetric groundstate.
