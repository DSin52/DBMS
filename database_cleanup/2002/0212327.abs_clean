We consider the quasi-de Sitter geometry of the inflationary universe. Wecalculate the energy flux of the slowly rolling background scalar field throughthe quasi-de Sitter apparent horizon and set it equal to the change of theentropy (1/4 of the area) multiplied by the temperature, dE=TdS. Remarkably,this thermodynamic law reproduces the Friedmann equation for the rolling scalarfield. The flux of the slowly rolling field through the horizon of the quasi-deSitter geometry is similar to the accretion of a rolling scalar field onto ablack hole, which we also analyze. Next we add inflaton fluctuations whichgenerate scalar metric perturbations. Metric perturbations result in avariation of the area entropy. Again, the equation dE=TdS with fluctuationsreproduces the linearized Einstein equations. In this picture as long as theEinstein equations hold, holography does not put limits on the quantum fieldtheory during inflation. Due to the accumulating metric perturbations, thehorizon area during inflation randomly wiggles with dispersion increasing withtime. We discuss this in connection with the stochastic decsription ofinflation. We also address the issue of the instability of inflatonfluctuations in the ``hot tin can'' picture of de Sitter horizon.
