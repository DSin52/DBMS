We consider supergravity configuration of D5 branes wrapped on supersymmetric2-cycles and use it to calculate one-point and two-point Green functions ofsome special operators in N=2 super Yang-Mills theory. We show that Greenfunctions obtained from supergravity include two very different parts. One ofthem corresponds to perturbative results of quantum field theory, and anotheris a non-perturbative effect which corresponds to contribution from instantonswith fractional charge. Comparing Green functions obtained from supergravityand gauge theory, we obtain radial/energy-scale relation for this gauge/gravitycorrespondence with N=2 supersymmetry. This relation leads right beta-functionof N=2 SYM from supergravity configuration.
