To better understand the possible breakdown of locality in quantumgravitational systems, we pursue the identity of precursors in the context ofAdS/CFT. Holography implies a breakdown of standard bulk locality which weexpect to occur only at extremely high energy. We consider precursors thatencode bulk information causally disconnected from the boundary and whosemeasurement involves nonlocal bulk processes. We construct a toy model ofholography which encapsulates the expected properties of precursors and compareit with previous such discussions. If these precursors can be identified in thegauge theory, they are almost certainly Wilson loops, perhaps with decorations,but the relevant information is encoded in the high-energy sector of the theoryand should not be observable by low energy measurements. This would be inaccord with the locality bound, which serves as a criterion for situationswhere breakdown of bulk locality is expected.
