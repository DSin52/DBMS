We compute the finite temperature correction to the induced fermion numberfor fermions coupled to a static SU(2) chiral background, using the derivativeexpansion technique. At zero temperature the induced fermion number istopological, being the winding number of the chiral background. At finitetemperature however, higher order terms in the derivative expansion givenontopological corrections to the winding number. We use this result to showthat the standard cancellation of the fractional parts of the fermion numberinside and outside the bag in an SU(2) x SU(2) hybrid chiral bag model of thenucleon does not occur at nonzero temperature.
