We construct a gravitational-anomaly-free effective action for the coupledsystem of IIA D=10 dynamical supergravity interacting with an NS5-brane. TheNS5-brane is considered as elementary in that the associated current is adelta-function supported on its worldvolume. Our approach is based on aChern-kernel which encodes the singularities of the three-form field strengthnear the brane in an SO(4)-invariant way and provides a solution for itsBianchi identity in terms of a two-form potential. A dimensional reduction ofthe recently constructed anomaly-free effective action for an elementaryM5-brane in D=11 is seen to reproduce our ten-dimensional action. TheChern-kernel approach provides in particular a concrete realization of theanomaly cancellation mechanism envisaged by Witten.
