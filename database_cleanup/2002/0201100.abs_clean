An improved correspondence formula is proposed for the calculation ofcorrelation functions of a conformal field theory perturbed by multi-traceoperators from the analysis of the dynamics of the dual field theory in Anti-deSitter space. The formula reduces to the usual AdS/CFT correspondence formulain the case of single-trace perturbations.
