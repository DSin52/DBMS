We elucidate the relationship between supersymmetric D3-branes and chiralbaryonic operators in the AdS/CFT correspondence. For supersymmetricbackgrounds of the form AdS_5 x H, we characterize via holomorphy a largefamily of supersymmetric D3-brane probes wrapped on H. We then quantize thisclassical family of probe solutions to obtain a BPS spectrum which describesD3-brane configurations on H. For the particular examples H = T^{1,1} and H =S^5, we match the BPS spectrum to the spectrum of chiral baryonic operators inthe dual gauge theory.
