We study bulk-boundary correlators in topological open membranes. The basicexample is the open membrane with a WZ coupling to a 3-form. We view the bulkinteraction as a deformation of the boundary string theory. This boundarystring has the structure of a homotopy Lie algebra, which can be viewed as aclosed string field theory. We calculate the leading order perturbativeexpansion of this structure. For the 3-form field we find that the C-fieldinduces a trilinear bracket, deforming the Lie algebra structure. This paper isthe first step towards a formal universal quantization of general quasi-Liebialgebroids.
