In order to extend the limits of classical theory application in themicroworld some weak generalization of Maxwell electrodynamics is suggested. Itis shown that slightly generalized classical Maxwell electrodynamics candescribe the intraatomic phenomena with the same success as relativisticquantum mechanics can do. Group-theoretical grounds for the description offermionic states by bosonic system are presented briefly. The advantages ofgeneralized electrodynamics in intraatomic region in comparison with standardMaxwell electrodynamics are demonstrated on testing example of hydrogen atom.We are able to obtain some results which are impossible in the framework ofstandard Maxwell electrodynamics. The Sommerfeld - Dirac formula for the finestructure of the hydrogen atom spectrum is obtained on the basis of suchMaxwell equations without appealing to the Dirac equation. The Bohr postulatesand the Lamb shift are proved to be the consequences of the equations underconsideration. The relationship of the new model with the Dirac theory isinvestigated. Possible directions of unification of such electrodynamics withgravity are mentioned.
