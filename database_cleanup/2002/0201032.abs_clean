Branes and Extra Dimensions, Boulder, Co, June 3-29, 2001We present three lectures on heterotic M-theory and a fourth lectureextending this theory to more general orbifolds. In Lecture 1, Horava-Wittentheory is briefly discussed. We then compactify this theory on Calabi-Yauthreefolds, choosing the "standard" embedding of the spin connection in thegauge connection. We derive, in detail, both the five-dimensional effectiveaction and the associated actions of the four-dimensional "end-of-the-world"branes. Lecture 2 is devoted to showing that this theory naturally admitsstatic, N=1 supersymmetry preserving BPS three-branes, the minimal vacuumhaving two such branes. One of these, the "visible" brane, is shown to supporta three-generation E_6 grand unified theory, whereas the other emerges as the"hidden" brane with unbroken E_8 gauge group. Thus heterotic M-theory emergesas a fundamental paradigm for so-called "brane world" scenarios of particlephysics. In Lecture 3, we introduce the concept of "non-standard" embeddings.These are shown to permit a vast generalization of allowed vacua, leading onthe visible brane to new grand unified theories, such as SO(10) and SU(5), andto the standard model SU(3)_C X SU(2)_L X U(1)_Y. It is demonstrated thatnon-standard embeddings generically imply the existence of five-branes in thebulk space. The physical properties of these bulk branes is discussed indetail. Finally, in Lecture 4 we move beyond Horava-Witten theory and considerorbifolds larger than S^1/Z_2. For explicitness, we consider M-theory orbifoldson S^1/Z_2 X T^4/Z_2, discussing their anomaly structure in detail andcompletely determining both the untwisted and twisted sector spectra.
