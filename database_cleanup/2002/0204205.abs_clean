Oct. 2001 and Proceedings of XXXVII Rencontres de Moriond, Les Arcs, France,9-16 March 2002In some models with infinite extra dimensions, gauge fields are localized ona brane by gravity. A generic property of these models is the existence ofarbitrarily light bulk modes of charged fields. This property may lead tointeresting low-energy effects such as electric charge non-conservation on thebrane (decay of electron to nothing). One may worry that light chargedKaluza--Klein modes would lead to unacceptable phenomenology due to theircopious production in, e.g., electron-positron annihilation and/or theircontribution to QED observables like anomalous magnetic moments. We argue,however, that both loop effects and production of light charged Kaluza--Kleinmodes are suppressed due to screening effect of gapless spectrum of bulkphotons.
