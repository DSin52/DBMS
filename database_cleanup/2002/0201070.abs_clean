We study the quantum mechanics of a charged particle on a constant curvaturenoncommutative Riemann surface in the presence of a constant magnetic field. Weformulate the problem by considering quantum mechanics on the noncommutativeAdS_2 covering space and gauging a discrete symmetry group which defines agenus-g surface. Although there is no magnetic field quantization on thecovering space, a quantization condition is required in order to havesingle-valued states on the Riemann surface. For noncommutative AdS_2 andsubcritical values of the magnetic field the spectrum has a discrete Landaulevel part as well as a continuum, while for overcritical values we obtain apurely noncommutative phase consisting entirely of Landau levels.
