We study the N=1 Sp(2N+2M)xSp(2N) gauge theory on a stack of N physical and Mfractional D3-branes in the background of an orientifolded conifold. Thegravity dual is a type IIB orientifold of adS_5xT^11 (with certain backgroundfluxes turned on) containing an O7-plane and 8 D7-branes. In the conformal case(M=0), we argue that the alpha'^2-corrections localized on the 8 D7-branes andthe O7-plane should give vanishing contributions to the supergravity equationsof motion for the bulk fields. In the cascading case (M not equal to 0), weargue that the alpha'^2-terms give rise to corrections which in the dualSp(2N+2M)xSp(2N) gauge theory can be interpreted as corrections to theanomalous dimensions of the matter fields.
