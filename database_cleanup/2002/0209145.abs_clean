We calculate the thermal partition function of DLCQ superstring on themaximally supersymmetric pp-wave background, which is realized as the Penroselimit of orbifolded $AdS_5\times S^5$ and known to be dual to the $\cN=2$``large'' quiver gauge theory as shown by S. Mukhi, M. Rangamani andE. Verlinde, hep-th/0204147. Making use of the path-integral technique, wederive the manifestly modular invariant expression and show the equivalencewith the free energy of second quantized free superstring on this background.The ``virtual strings'' wound around the temporal circle play essential rolesfor realizing the modular invariance and for a simple analysis on the Hagedorntemperature. We also calculate the thermal one-loop amplitudes of open stringsunder the various backgrounds of the supersymmetric time-like and EuclideanD-branes, and confirm the existence of correct open-closed string duality.Furthermore, we extend these thermodynamical analysis to the 6-dimensional DLCQpp-waves with general RR and NSNS flux. These superstring vacua are similarlyderived from the supersymmetric (half SUSY) and non-supersymmetric orbifolds of$AdS_3 \times S^3 \times M^4$ ($M^4 =T^4 $ or $K3$) by the appropriate Penroselimits, giving rise to the SUSY enhancement as in the case of orbifolded $AdS_5\times S^5$.
