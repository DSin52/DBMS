Title: Effective action in a quantized metric

Authors: Z. Haba

We calculate the effective action in Yang-Mills and scalar \phi^4 quantumfield theory with quantized scale invariant metric treated non-perturbativelyin d=4 dimensions. There is no charge renormalization in the one-loop order formatter fields. We show that the electromagnetic energy of point charges can befinite. The temperature dependence of the effective action in inflationarymodels is changed substantially as a result of an interaction with quantumgravity.
