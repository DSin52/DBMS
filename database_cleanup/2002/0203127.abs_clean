The massless bosonic field compactified on the circle of rational $R^2$ isreexamined in the presense of boundaries. A particular class of modelscorresponding to $R^2=\frac{1}{2k}$ is distinguished by demanding the existenceof a consistent set of Newmann boundary states. The boundary states areconstructed explicitly for these models and the fusion rules are derived fromthem. These are the ones prescribed by the Verlinde formula from the S-matrixof the theory. In addition, the extended symmetry algebra of these theories isconstructed which is responsible for the rationality of these theories.Finally, the chiral space of these models is shown to split into a direct sumof irreducible modules of the extended symmetry algebra.
