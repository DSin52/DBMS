Correlation functions of chiral primary operators and their superconformaldescendants in the N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory are studied indetail in a one-instanton background and at large N. Whereas earliercalculations were restricted to correlation functions that are saturated by the16 exact superconformal fermionic moduli, here the effect of the set ofadditional fermionic moduli associated with the embeddings of the SU(2)instanton in SU(N) is considered. The presence of the extra fermionic modes isessential for matching Yang-Mills instanton effects in various correlationfunctions with D-instanton effects in type IIB string theory via the AdS/CFTconjecture. The leading terms of this kind on the string side contribute atorder 1/(alpha'), which is the same order as the R^4 interaction. For example,the instanton contributions to correlation functions of higher dimensionalchiral primary operators are seen to match amplitudes involving Kaluza-Kleinexcitations of the supergravity fields, as expected. Another example is thematching of certain multi-fermion correlation functions which correspond tocertain multi-fermion interactions required by supersymmetry of the IIB stringeffective action. Careful analysis of a variety of competing effects makes itpossible to decipher contributions corresponding to higher derivativeinteractions in the IIB effective action. In this manner it is possible tocheck for the presence of terms of order alpha'. Comments are also made on thestructure of instanton contributions to near-extremal correlation functions ofchiral primary operators.
