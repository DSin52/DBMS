We consider the M-theory lifts of configurations of type IIA D6-branesintersecting at angles. In supersymmetry preserving cases, the lifts correspondto special holonomy geometries, like conifolds and $G_2$ holonomysingularities. Transitions in which D6-branes approach and recombine lift totopology changing transition in these geometries. In some instancesnon-supersymmetric configurations can be reliably lifted, leading to the sametopological manifolds, but endowed with non-supersymmetric metrics. In thesecases the phase transitions are driven dynamically, due to instabilitieslocalized at the singularities. Even though in non-compact setups theinstabilities relax to infinity, in compact situations there exist nearbyminima where the instabilities dissappear and the decay reaches a well-defined(in general supersymmetric) endpoint.
