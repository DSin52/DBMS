We discuss interacting quantum field theory in de Sitter space and argue thatthe Mottola-Allen vacuum ambiguity is an artifact of free field theory. Thenature of the nonthermality of the MA-vacua is also clarified. We proposeanalyticity of correlation functions as a fundamental requirement of quantumfield theory in curved spacetimes. In de Sitter space, this principledetermines the vacuum unambiguously and facilitates the systematic developmentof perturbation theory.
