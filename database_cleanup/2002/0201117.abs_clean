We study thermodynamic evaporation of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes interms of a low energy perturbation theory. A small black hole which is far fromthe cosmological horizon and observers at the spacelike hypersurface whereblack hole attraction and expansion of cosmological horizon balance exactly areconsidered. In the low energy perturbation, scalar field equations are solvedin both regions of the hypersurface and scattering amplitudes are derived. Andthen the desired thermal temperatures from the two horizons are obtained as a``minimal'' value of the statistical thermal temperature, and the fine-tuningbetween amplitudes gives a relation of the two temperatures.
