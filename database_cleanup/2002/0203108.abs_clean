In this note, we consider the two derivative truncation of boundary stringfield theory for unstable D9 branes in Type IIA string theory. We constructmultiples of the stable codimension 1 solitons that correspond to stacks of D8branes. We find the fluctuation modes that correspond to open stringsstretching between the branes, and find that their masses are consistent withthe string tension. We show that these modes are localized halfway between thebranes and that their width is independent of the brane separation.
