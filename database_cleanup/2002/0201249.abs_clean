Using the recent proposal for the observables in open string field theory, weexplicitly compute the coupling of closed string tachyon and massless stateswith the open string states up to level two. Using these couplings, we thencalculate the tree level S-matrix elements of two closed string tachyons or twomassless states in the open string field theory. Up to some contact terms, theresults reproduce exactly the corresponding amplitudes in the bosonic stringtheory.
