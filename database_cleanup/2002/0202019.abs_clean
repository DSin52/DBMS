Dirac prescription for dealing with brane dynamics invokes a rest frameformulation of the 'sandwich' brane action. We demonstrate this method by firstpedagogically re-deriving Snell law. Applying the method to a general N-dimbrane evolving in some (N+1)-dim background, the resulting equations of motion(i) Israel continuity condition, (ii) Energy/momentum conservation on thebrane, and (iii) Geodetic-type equation for the brane.Remarkably, the last two equations survive even when the bulk gravitationalcoupling is switched off. Special attention is drawn to the Regge-Teitelboimand Randall-Sundrum cases.
