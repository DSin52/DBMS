Asymptotically de Sitter spaces can be described by Euclidean boundarytheories with entropies given by the modified Cardy--Verlinde formula. We showthat the Cardy--Verlinde formula describes a string with a rescaled tensionwhich in fact is a string at the stretched cosmological horizon as seen fromthe boundary. The temperature of the boundary theory is the rescaled Hagedorntemperature of the string. Our results agree with an alternative description ofasymptotically de Sitter spaces in terms of strings on the stretched horizon.The relation between the two descriptions is given by the large gravitationalredshift between the boundary and the stretched horizon and a shift in energy.
