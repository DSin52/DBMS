We continue the analysis of Vacuum String Field Theory in the presence of aconstant B field. In particular we give a proof of the ratio of brane tensionsis the expected one. On the wake of the recent literature we introducewedge-like states and orthogonal projections. Finally we show a few examples ofthe smoothing out effects of the B field on some of the singularities thatappear in VSFT.
