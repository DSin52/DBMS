simplified, further discussion and references addedStellar structure in braneworlds is markedly different from that in ordinarygeneral relativity. As an indispensable first step towards a more generalanalysis, we completely solve the ``on brane'' 4-dimensional Gauss and Codazziequations for an arbitrary static spherically symmetric star in aRandall--Sundrum type II braneworld. We then indicate how this on-braneboundary data should be propagated into the bulk in order to determine the full5-dimensional spacetime geometry. Finally, we demonstrate how this procedurecan be generalized to solid objects such as planets.
