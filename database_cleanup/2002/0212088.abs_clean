In this paper we study the effects of noncommutativity on a closedsuperstring propagating in the spacetime that is compactified on tori. Theeffects of compactification and noncommutativity appear in the momentum,quantization, supercurrent, super-conformal generators and in the boundarystate of the closed superstring emitted from a D$_p$-brane with theNS$\otimes$NS background $B$-field.
