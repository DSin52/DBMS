We derive a general expression for the gauge invariant mass (m_G) for anAbelian gauge field, as induced by vacuum polarization, in 1+1 dimensions. Fromits relation to the chiral anomaly, we show that m_G has to satisfy a certainquantization condition. This quantization can be, on the other hand, explicitlyverified by using the exact general expression for the gauge invariant mass interms of the fermion propagator. This result is applied to some explicitexamples, exploring the possibility of having interesting physical situationswhere the value of $m_G$ departs from its canonical value. We also study thepossibility of generalizing the results to the 2+1 dimensional case at finitetemperature, showing that there are indeed situations where a finite andnon-vanishing gauge invariant mass is induced.
