We calculate the scalar potential in the gauged N=2 supergravity with asingle hypermultiplet, whose generic quaternionic moduli space metric has anabelian isometry. This isometry is gauged by the use of a graviphoton gaugefield. The hypermultiplet metric and the scalar potential are both governed bythe single real potential that is a solution to the 3d (integrable) continuousToda equation. An explicit solution, controlled by the Eisenstein seriesE_{3/2}, is found in the case of the D-instanton-corrected universalhypermultilet moduli space metric having an U(1)xU(1) isometry, with one of theisometries being gauged.
