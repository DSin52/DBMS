We construct a new set of intersecting D4-brane models that yield the(non-supersymmetric) standard model up to vector-like matter and, in somecases, extra U(1) factors in the gauge group.The models are constrained by the requirement that twisted tadpoles cancel,and that the gauge boson coupled to the weak hypercharge U(1)_Y does not get astring-scale mass via a generalised Green-Schwarz mechanism. We find six-stackmodels that contain all of the Yukawa couplings to the tachyonic Higgs doubletsthat are needed to generate mass terms for the fermions at renormalisablelevel, but which have charged-singlet scalar tachyons and an unwanted extraU(1) gauge symmetry after spontaneous symmetry breaking. There is also asix-stack model without any unwanted gauged U(1) symmetries, but which only hasthe Yukawa couplings to generate masses for the u quarks and charged leptons. Aparticular eight-stack model is free of charged-singlet tachyons and has gaugecoupling strengths whose ratios at the string scale are close to those measuredat the electroweak scale, consistent with the string scale being at most a fewTeV.
