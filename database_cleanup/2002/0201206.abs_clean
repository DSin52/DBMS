In this paper we study $T^2$ compactification of 6-dimensional massive typeIIA supergravity in presence ofRamond-Ramond background fluxes. The resulting theory in four dimensions isshown to possess $SL(2,R)\times SL(2,R)\times O(4,20)$ duality symmetry. It isshown that specific elements of this symmetry relate massive type IIAcompactified on $K3\times T^2$ (with fluxes along $K3$) to the ordinary typeIIA compactified on $K3\times T^2$ (with fluxes along $T^2$). In turn, thisrelationship is exploited to relate Romans theory to heterotic strings. TheD8-brane (domain-wall) wrapped on $K3\times T^2$ is related to {\it puregravity} heterotic solution which is a direct product of 6-dimensional flatspacetime and a 4-dimensional Taub-NUT instanton.
