In this Letter we study the dependence of the spectrum of fluctuations ininflationary cosmology on possible effects of trans-Planckian physics, usingthe Corley/Jacobson dispersion relations as an example. We compare the methodsused in previous work [1] with the WKB approximation, give a new exactanalytical result, and study the dependence of the spectrum obtained using theapproximate method of Ref. [1] on the choice of the matching time betweendifferent time intervals. We also comment on recent work subsequent to Ref. [1]on the trans-Planckian problem for inflationary cosmology.
