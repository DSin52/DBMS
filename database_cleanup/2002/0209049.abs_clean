In recent work, it was shown that velocity-dependent forces between movingstrings or branes lead to an accelerating expanding universe without assumingthe existence of a cosmological constant. Here we show that the repulsivevelocity-dependent force arises in more general contexts and can lead to cosmicstructure formation.
