The pseudo-complex Poincare group encodes both a universal speed and amaximal acceleration, which can be viewed as the kinematics of Born-Infeldelectrodynamics. The irreducible representations of this group are constructed,providing the particle spectrum of a relativistic quantum theory that alsorespects a maximal acceleration. One finds that each standard relativisticparticle is associated with a 'pseudo'-partner of equal spin but genericallydifferent mass. These pseudo-partners act as Pauli-Villars regulators for theother member of the doublet, as is found from the explicit construction ofquantum field theory on pseudo-complex spacetime. Conversely, a Pauli-Villarsregularised quantum field theory on real spacetime possesses a field phasespace with integrable pseudo-complex structure, which gives rise to a quantumfield theory on pseudo-complex spacetime.This equivalence between (i) maximal acceleration kinematics, (ii)pseudo-complex quantum field theory, and (iii) Pauli-Villars regularisationrigorously establishes a conjecture on the regularising property of the maximalacceleration principle in quantum field theory, by Nesterenko, Feoli, Lambiaseand Scarpetta [Phys. Rev. D60, 065001].
