We present several supergravity solutions corresponding to both Dp, as wellas Dp-Dp' systems, in NS-NS and R-R PP-wave background originating from AdS_3times S^3 times R^4. The Dp brane solutions, p=1,..,5 are fully localized,whereas Dp-Dp' are localized along common transverse directions. We alsodiscuss the supersymmetry properties of these solutions and the worldsheetconstruction for the p-p' system.
