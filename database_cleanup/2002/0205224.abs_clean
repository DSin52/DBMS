Title: General Geometry and Geometry of Electromagnetism

Authors: Shervgi Shahverdiyev

Comments: LaTeX, 6 pages, misprints corrected

GeometryIt is shown that Electromagnetism creates geometry different from Riemannianone. General geometry containing Riemannian and geometry underlyingElectromagnetism as special cases is constructed. Action for electromagneticfield and Maxwell equations are derived from curvature function of Geometry ofElectromagnetism.
