We consider a general N=(2,2) non-linear sigma model with a torsion. We showthat the consistency of N=(2,2) supersymmetry implies that the target manifoldis necessary equipped with two (in general, different) Poisson structures.Finally we argue that the Poisson geometry of the target space is acharacteristic feature of the sigma models with extended supersymmetry.
