We show that the high temperature behavior of non-commutative QED may besimply obtained from Boltzmann transport equations for classical particles. Thetransport equation for the charge neutral particle is shown to becharacteristically different from that for the charged particle. Theseequations correctly generate, for arbitrary values of the non-commutativeparameter theta, the leading, gauge independent hard thermal loops, arisingfrom the fermion and the gauge sectors. We briefly discuss the generatingfunctional of hard thermal amplitudes.
