Gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions whose gauge symmetry is spontaneously brokento a finite group enjoy a quantum group symmetry which includes the residualgauge symmetry. This symmetry provides a framework in which fundamentalexcitations (electric charges) and topological excitations (magnetic fluxes)can be treated on equal footing. In order to study symmetry breaking by bothelectric and magnetic condensates we develop a theory of symmetry breakingwhich is applicable to models whose symmetry is described by a quantum group(quasitriangular Hopf algebra). Using this general framework we investigate thesymmetry breaking and confinement phenomena which occur in (2+1)-dimensionalgauge theories. Confinement of particles is linked to the formation ofstring-like defects. Symmetry breaking by an electric condensate leads tomagnetic confinement and vice-versa. We illustrate the general formalism withexamples where the symmetry is broken by electric, magnetic and dyoniccondensates.
