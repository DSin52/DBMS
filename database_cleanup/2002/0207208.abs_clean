Using mirror pairs (M_3, W_3) in type II superstring compactifications onCalabi-Yau threefolds, we study, geometrically, F-theory duals of M-theory onseven manifolds with G_2 holonomy. We first develop a way for getting LandauGinzburg (LG) Calabi-Yau threefols W_3, embedded in four complex dimensionaltoric varieties, mirror to sigma model on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds M_3. Thismethod gives directly the right dimension without introducing non dynamicalvariables. Then, using toric geometry tools, we discuss the duality betweenM-theory on (S^1 x M_3)/Z_2 with G_2 holonomy and F-theory on ellipticallyfibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds with SU(4) holonomy, containing W_3 mirrormanifolds. Illustrating examples are presented.
