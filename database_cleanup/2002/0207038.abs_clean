The contributions to the heat kernel coefficients generated by the corners ofthe boundary are studied. For this purpose the internal and external sectors ofa wedge and a cone are considered. These sectors are obtained by introducing,inside the wedge, a cylindrical boundary. Transition to a cone is accomplishedby identification of the wedge sides. The basic result of the paper is thecalculation of the individual contributions to the heat kernel coefficientsgenerated by the boundary singularities. In the course of this analysis certainpatterns, that are followed by these contributions, are revealed. Theimplications of the obtained results in calculations of the vacuum energy forregions with nonsmooth boundary are discussed. The rules for obtaining all theheat kernel coefficients for the minus Laplace operator defined on a polygon orin its cylindrical generalization are formulated.
