We study the behavior of matrix string theory in the strong coupling region,where matrix strings reduce to discrete light-cone type IIA superstrings exceptat the usual string-interaction points. In the large N limit, this reductioncorresponds to the double-dimensional reduction from wrapped supermembranes onR^{10} x S^1 to type IIA superstrings on R^{10} in the light-cone gauge. Suchreductions were shown classically, while they are not obvious quantummechanically. Recently, Sekino and Yoneya analyzed the double-dimensionalreduction of the wrapped supermembrane quantum mechanically to one-loop orderin the strong coupling expansion. We analyze the problem in matrix stringtheory by using the same expansion. At the one-loop level, the quantumcorrections cancel out as was presented by them. However, at the two-loop levelwe find that the quantum corrections cancel out only for the leading terms inthe large N.
