We propose an exactly solvable Grassmannian sigma-model coupled to theChern-Simons theory. In the presence of a novel topological term our modeladmits exact self-dual vortex solutions which are identical to those of pureGrassmannian model, but the topological charge has a physical meaning as amagnetic flux since the gauge field is no longer auxiliary. We also extend thetheory to a noncommutative plane and analyze the BPS solutions.
