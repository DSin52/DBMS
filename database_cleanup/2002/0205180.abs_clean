We consider a D3-brane as boundary of a five dimensional charged anti deSitter black hole. We show that the charge of the black hole induces a regularcosmological evolution for the scale factor of the brane, with a smoothtransition between a contracting and an eventual expanding phase. Simpleanalytical solutions can be obtained in the case of a vanishing effectivecosmological constant on the brane. A nonvanishing cosmological constant, orthe inclusion of radiation on the brane, does not spoil the regularity of thesesolutions at small radii, and observational constraints such as the ones fromprimordial nucleosynthesis can be easily met. Fluctuations of brane fieldsremain in the linear regime provided the minimal size of the scale factor issufficiently large. We conclude with an analysis of the Cardy-Verlinde formulain this set up.
