We discuss Strassler's hypothesis of matching nonperturbative effects inorbifold pairs of gauge theories which are perturbatively planar equivalent.One of the examples considered is the parent N=1 SU(N) supersymmetricYang-Mills theory and its nonsupersymmetric orbifold daughter. We apply twotheorems; (ii) putting the theory on small-size T^4 or R^3 x S^1 the parent anddaughter theories are weakly coupled and amenable to quasiclassical treatment.In all cases our consideration yields a mismatch between the parent anddaughter theories. Thus, regretfully, we present evidence against Strassler'shypothesis.
