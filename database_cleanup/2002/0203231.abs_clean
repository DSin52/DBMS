Dirichlet p-branes in the background of pp waves are constructed using themassive Green-Schwarz worldsheet action for open strings. These branes arelocalized at the origin and only for $p=7, 5, 3$ preserve half thesupersymmetries. The spectrum of the brane theory is analyzed and is found tobe in agreement with the spectrum of the small fluctuations of the world-volumesuper Yang-Mills theory in this background. These branes are expected tocorrespond to objects that are nonperturbative in $N$ in the dual gauge theory.
