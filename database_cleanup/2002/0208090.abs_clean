We study complex bosons and fermions coupled through a generalized Yukawatype coupling in the large-N_c limit following ideas of Rajeev [Int. Jour. Mod.Phys. A 9 (1994) 5583]. We study a linear approximation to this model. We showthat in this approximation we do not have boson-antiboson andfermion-antifermion bound states occuring together. There is a possibility ofhaving only fermion-antifermion bound states. We support this claim by findingdistributional solutions with energies lower than the two mass treshold in thefermion sector. This also has implications from the point of view of scatteringtheory to this model. We discuss some aspects of the scattering above the twomass treshold of boson pairs and fermion pairs. We also briefly present agauged version of the same model and write down the linearized equations ofmotion.
