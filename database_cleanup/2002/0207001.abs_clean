We find a new subalgebra of the star product in the matter sector. Itselements are squeezed states whose matrices commute with (K_1)^2. Thissubalgebra contains a large set of projectors. The states are represented bytheir eigenvalues and we find a mapping between the eigenvalues representationand other known representations. The sliver is naturally in this subalgebra.Surprisingly, all the generalized butterfly states are also in this subalgebra,enabling us to analyze their spectrum, and to show the orthogonality ofdifferent butterfly states. This means that multi D-brane states can be builtof butterfly states.
