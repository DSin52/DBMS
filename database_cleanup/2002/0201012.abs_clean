First order rotational perturbations of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metricare considered in the framework of the brane-world cosmological models. Arotation equation, relating the perturbations of the metric tensor to theangular velocity of the matter on the brane is derived under the assumption ofslow rotation. The mathematical structure of the rotation equation imposesstrong restrictions on the temporal and spatial dependence of the brane matterangular velocity. The study of the integrable cases of the rotation equationleads to three distinct models, which are considered in detail. As a generalresult we find that, similarly to the general relativistic case, the rotationalperturbations decay due to the expansion of the matter on the brane. One of theobtained consistency conditions leads to a particular, purely inflationarybrane-world cosmological model, with the cosmological fluid obeying anon-linear barotropic equation of state.
