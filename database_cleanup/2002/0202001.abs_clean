Title: Explicit SU(5) monopole solutions

Authors: Mark W. Meckes

Comments: 5 pages

We describe in detail a general scheme for embedding several BPS monopolesinto a theory with a larger gauge group, which generalizes embeddings of SU(2)monopoles discussed by several authors. This construction is applied to obtainexplicit fields for monopoles with several charge configurations in theSU(5)\to [SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)]/Z_6 model.
