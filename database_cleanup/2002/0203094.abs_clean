We show that a formalism for analyzing the near-horizon conformal symmetry ofSchwarzschild black holes using a scalar field probe is capable of describingblack hole decay. The decay rate is shown to be correctly described by geodesicmotion in the space of black hole masses. This provides a novel geometricinterpretation for the decay of black holes. We also show that the near-horizonconformal symmetry predicts a precise correction term to the usual expressionfor the decay rate of black holes. The results obtained here are a consequenceof the holographic nature of the system.
