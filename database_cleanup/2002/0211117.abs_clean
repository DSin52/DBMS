Title: Inflation via Black Holes with Quantized Area Spectrum

Authors: Tongu\c{c} Rador

Comments: Added a section. Corrected typos

I present a very simplistic toy model for the inflationary paradigm where thesize of the universe undergoes a period of exponential growth. The basicassumption I make use of is that black holes might have a quantized area (mass)spectrum with a stable ground state and that the universe has started with atightly packed collection of these objects alone.
