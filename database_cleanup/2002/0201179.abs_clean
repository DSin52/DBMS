Based on the gauge independent decomposition of the non-Abelian gauge fieldinto the dual potential and the valence potential, we calculate the one loopeffective action of SU(2) QCD in an arbitrary constant monopole background,using the background field method. Our result provides a strong evidence for adynamical symmetry breaking through the monopole condensation, which can inducethe dual Meissner effect and establish the confinement of color, in thenon-Abelian gauge theory. The result is obtained by separating the topologicaldegrees which describe the non-Abelian monopoles from the dynamical degrees ofthe gauge potential, and integrating out all the dynamical degrees of QCD.
