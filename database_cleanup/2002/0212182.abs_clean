The local composite operator A^2 is analysed in pure Yang-Mills theory in theLandau gauge within the algebraic renormalization. It is proven that theanomalous dimension of A^2 is not an independent parameter, being expressed asa linear combination of the gauge beta function and of the anomalous dimensionof the gauge fields.
