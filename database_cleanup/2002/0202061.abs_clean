on Quantum Field Theory under the Influence of External Conditions, Leipzig,Germany, 10-14 Sep 2001We introduce the technique of inverse Mellin transform in a problem ofstrong-field QED. We show that the {\it moments} of pair production width in auniform background magnetic field are proportional to the derivatives of photonpolarization function at the zero momentum. Hence, the pair-production width orthe absorptive part of the photon polarization function is calculable from thelatter by the inverse Mellin transform. Using the {\it Kramers-Kronig}relation, the dispersive part of photon polarization function can be computedas well. Therefore the analytic property of the photon polarization function inall energy range is obtained. We also discuss briefly the possible extensionsof this technique to other problems.
