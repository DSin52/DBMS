Title: Equivalence between different canonical quantizations of the O(N)

non-linear sigma model in the functional Schrodinger representationAuthors: A. A. Deriglazov, W. Oliveira and G. Oliveira-Neto

Comments: Revtex version, 8 pages

In this work we consider the O(N) non-linear sigma model in its originalversion as a second-class constrained field theory and then as a first-classconstrained field theory. We canonically quantize these versions of the modelunconstrained formalism, the Dirac second-class and the Dirac first-class. Wedemonstrate the equivalence between the different methods by showing that thequantum energy spectrum of all of them are governed by the same functionaldifferential equation.
