The Lie algebroids are generalization of the Lie algebras. They arise, inparticular, as a mathematical tool in investigations of dynamical systems withthe first class constraints. Here we consider canonical symmetries ofHamiltonian systems generated by a special class of Lie algebroids. The``coordinate part'' of the Hamiltonian phase space is the Poisson manifold $M$and the Lie algebroid brackets are defined by means of the Poisson bivector.The Lie algebroid action defined on $M$ can be lifted to the phase space. Themain observation is that the classical BRST operator has the same form as inthe case of the Lie groups action. Two examples are analyzed. In the first, $M$is the space of $SL(3,C)$-opers on Riemann curves with the Adler-Gelfand-Dikiibrackets. The corresponding Hamiltonian system is the $W_3$-gravity. Its phasespace is the base of the algebroid bundle. The sections of the bundle are thesecond order differential operators on Riemann curves. They are the gaugesymmetries of the theory. The moduli space of $W_3$ geometry of Riemann curvesis the symplectic quotient with respect to their action. It is demonstratedthat the nonlinear brackets and the second order differential operators arisefrom the canonical brackets and the standard gauge transformations in theChern-Simons field theory, as a result of the partial gauge fixing. The secondexample is $M=C^4$ endowed with the Sklyanin brackets. The symplectic reductionwith respect to the algebroid action leads to a generalization of the rationalCalogero-Moser model. As in the previous example the Sklyanin brackets can bederived from a ``free theory.'' In this case it is a ``relativisticdeformation'' of the $SL(2,C)$ Higgs bundle over an elliptic curve.
