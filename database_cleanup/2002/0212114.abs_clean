The status of string theory is reviewed, and major recent developments -especially those in going beyond perturbation theory in the string theory andquantum field theory frameworks - are discussed. This analysis helps betterunderstand the role and place of string theory in the modern picture of thephysical world. Even though quantum field theory describes a wide range ofexperimental phenomena, it is emphasized that there are some insurmountableproblems inherent in it - notably the impossibility to formulate the quantumtheory of gravity on its basis - which prevent it from being a fundamentalphysical theory of the world of microscopic distances. It is this task, thecreation of such a theory, which string theory, currently far from completion,is expected to solve. In spite of its somewhat vague current form, stringtheory has already led to a number of serious results and greatly contributedto progress in the understanding of quantum field theory. It is thesedevelopments which are our concern in this review.
