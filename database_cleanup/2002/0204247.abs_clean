We consider C/Z_N and C^2/Z_N orbifolds of heterotic string theories and Z_Norbifolds of AdS_3. We study theories with N=2 worldsheet superconformalinvariance and construct RG flows. Following Harvey, Kutasov, Martinec andMoore, we compute g_cl and show that it decreases monotonically along RG flows-as conjectured by them. For the heterotic string theories, the gauge degrees offreedom do not contribute to the computation of g_cl.
