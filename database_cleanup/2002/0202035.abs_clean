We find that the quantum monodromy matrix associated with a derivativenonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS) model exhibits U(2) or U(1,1) symmetry dependingon the sign of the related coupling constant. By using a variant of quantuminverse scattering method which is directly applicable to field theoreticalmodels, we derive all possible commutation relations among the operator valuedelements of such monodromy matrix. Thus, we obtain the commutation relationbetween creation and annihilation operators of quasi-particles associated withDNLS model and find out the $S$-matrix for two-body scattering. We also observethat, for some special values of the coupling constant, there exists an upperbound on the number of quasi-particles which can form a soliton state for thequantum DNLS model.
