Title: Brane cosmology

Comments: 32 pages; 3 figures; Latex (PTPTeX); to appear in the Proceedings of

the YITP workshop on "Braneworld - Dynamics of spacetime boundary"These notes give an introductory review on brane cosmology. This subjectdeals with the cosmological behaviour of a brane-universe, i.e. athree-dimensional space, where ordinary matter is confined, embedded in ahigher dimensional spacetime. In the tractable case of a five-dimensional bulkspacetime, the brane (modified) Friedmann equation is discussed in detail, andvarious other aspects are presented, such as cosmological perturbations, bulkscalar fields and systems with several branes.
