The minimal bosonic higher spin gauge theory in four dimensions containsmassless particles of spin s=0,2,4,.. that arise in the symmetric product oftwo spin 0 singletons. It is based on an infinite dimensional extension of theAdS_4 algebra a la Vasiliev. We derive an expansion scheme in which thegravitational gauge fields are treated exactly and the gravitational curvaturesand the higher spin gauge fields as weak perturbations. We also give thedetails of an explicit iteration procedure for obtaining the field equations toarbitrary order in curvatures. In particular, we highlight the structure of allthe quadratic terms in the field equations.
