We construct all possible orthogonally intersecting S-brane solutions in11-dimensions corresponding to standard supersymmetric M-brane intersections.It is found that the solutions can be obtained by multiplying the brane and thetransverse directions with appropriate powers of two hyperbolic functions oftime. This is the S-brane analog of the ``harmonic function rule''. Thetransverse directions can be hyperbolic, flat or spherical. We also discusssome properties of these solutions.
