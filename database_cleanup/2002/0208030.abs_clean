Title: A "Periodic Table" for Supersymmetric M-Theory Compactifications

We develop a systematic method for classifying supersymmetric orbifoldcompactifications of M-theory. By restricting our attention to abelianorbifolds with low order, in the special cases where elements do not includecoordinate shifts, we construct a "periodic table" of such compactifications,organized according to the orbifolding group (order up to 12) and dimension (upto 7). An intriguing connection between supersymmetric orbifolds andG2-structures is explored.
