Title: U-opportunities

Comments: Lecture at les Houches 2001

It seems to me at this time that two recent developments may permit fastprogress on our way to understand the symmetry structure of toroidally(compactified and) reduced M-theory. The first indication of a (possibly) thinspot in the wall that prevents us from deriving a priori the U-dualitysymmetries of these models is to be found in the analysis of the hyperbolicbilliards that control the chaotic time evolution of (quasi)homogeneousanisotropic String, Supergravity or Einstein cosmologies near a spacelikesingularity. What happens is that U-duality symmetry controls chaos vianegative constant curvature. On the other hand it was noticed in 1982 that(symmetrizable) ''hyperbolic'' Kac-Moody algebras have maximal rank ten,exactly like superstring models and that two of these four rank ten algebrasmatched physical theories. My second reason for optimism actually predates alsothe previous breakthrough, it was the discovery in 1998 of surprisingsuperalgebras extending U-dualities to all (p+1)-forms (associated top-branes). They have a super-nonlinear sigma model structure similar to thesymmetric space structure associated to 0-forms and they obey a universalself-duality field equation. As the set of forms is doubled to implementelectric-magnetic duality, they obey a set of first order equations. Moreremains to be discovered but the beauty and subtlety of the structure cannot bea random emergence from chaos. In fact we shall explain how a third maximalrank hyperbolic algebra $BE_{10}$ controls heterotic cosmological chaos and howas predicted Einstein's General Relativity fits into the general picture.
