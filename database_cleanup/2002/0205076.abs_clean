We compute the DC conductance with two different methods, which both exploitthe integrability of the theories under consideration. On one hand we determinethe conductance through a defect by means of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz andstandard relativistic potential scattering theory based on a Landauer transporttheory picture. On the other hand, we propose a Kubo formula for a defectsystem and evaluate the current-current two-point correlation function itinvolves with the help of a form factor expansion. For a variety of defects ina fermionic system we find excellent agreement between the two differenttheoretical descriptions.
