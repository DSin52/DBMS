Title: Finite dimensions and the covariant entropy bound

Authors: H. Casini

Comments: Discussion on the domain of the function n added

We explore the consequences of assuming that the bounded space-time subsetscontain a finite number of degrees of freedom. A physically natural hypothesisis that this number is additive for spatially separated subsets. We show thatthis assumption conflicts with the Lorentz symmetry of Minkowski space since itimplies that a conserved current determines the number of degrees of freedom.However, the entanglement across boundaries can lead to a subadditive propertyfor the degrees of freedom of spatially separated sets. We show that thiscondition and the Poincare symmetry lead to the Bousso covariant entropy boundfor Minkowski space.
