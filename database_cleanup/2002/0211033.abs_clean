Title: Fate of the Born-Infeld solution in string theory

Authors: G. Karatheodoris, A. Pinzul and A. Stern

Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures

We argue that theBorn-Infeld solution on the D$9-$brane is unstable under inclusion ofderivative corrections to Born-Infeld theory coming from string theory. Morespecifically, we find no electrostatic solutions to the first order correctedBorn-Infeld theory on the D$9-$brane which give a finite value for theLagrangian.
