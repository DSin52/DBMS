We study physical applications of the Bohm metrics, which are infinitesequences of inhomogeneous Einstein metrics on spheres and products of spheresof dimension 5 <= d <= 9. We prove that all the Bohm metrics on S^3 x S^2 andS^3 x S^3 have negative eigenvalue modes of the Lichnerowicz operator and bynumerical methods we establish that Bohm metrics on S^5 have negativeeigenvalues too. We argue that all the Bohm metrics will have negative modes.These results imply that higher-dimensional black-hole spacetimes where theBohm metric replaces the usual round sphere metric are classically unstable. Wealso show that the stability criterion for Freund-Rubin solutions is the sameas for black-hole stability, and hence such solutions using Bohm metrics willalso be unstable. We consider possible endpoints of the instabilities, and showthat all Einstein-Sasaki manifolds give stable solutions. We show how Wickrotation of Bohm metrics gives spacetimes that provide counterexamples to astrict form of the Cosmic Baldness conjecture, but they are still consistentwith the intuition behind the cosmic No-Hair conjectures. We show how theLorentzian metrics may be created ``from nothing'' in a no-boundary setting. Weargue that Lorentzian Bohm metrics are unstable to decay to de Sitterspacetime. We also argue that noncompact versions of the Bohm metrics haveinfinitely many negative Lichernowicz modes, and we conjecture a generalrelation between Lichnerowicz eigenvalues and non-uniqueness of the Dirichletproblem for Einstein's equations.
