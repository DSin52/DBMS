As shown by Freedman, Gubser, Pilch and Warner, the RG flow in ${\cal N}=4$super-Yang-Mills theory broken to an ${\cal N}=1$ theory by the addition of amass term can be described in terms of a supersymmetric domain wall solution infive-dimensional ${\cal N}=8$ gauged supergravity. The FGPW flow is an exampleof a holographic RG flow in a field theory on a flat background. Here we putthe field theory studied by Freedman, Gubser, Pilch and Warner on a curved$AdS_4$ background, and we construct the supersymmetric domain wall solutionwhich describes the RG flow in this field theory. This solution is a curved(non Ricci flat) domain wall solution. This example demonstrates thatholographic RG flows in supersymmetric field theories on a curved $AdS_4$background can be described in terms of curved supersymmetric domain wallsolutions.
