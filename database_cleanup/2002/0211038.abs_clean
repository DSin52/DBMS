In this paper we study the non-maximally symmetric D-branes on the SU(2)group discussed in a previous article (hep-th/0205097). Using the two-formdefined in hep-th/0205097 the DBI action on the branes is constructed. Thisaction is checked for its agreement with CFT predictions. The geometry of thebranes is analyzed in detail, and the singularities of branes covering theentire group are found.
