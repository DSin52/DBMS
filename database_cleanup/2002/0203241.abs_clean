Presently there is preliminary observational evidence that the cosmologicalconstant might be non zero, and hence that our Universe is eternallyaccelerating (de Sitter). This poses fundamental problems for string theory,since a scattering matrix is not well defined in such Universes. In a previouspaper we have presented a model, based on (non-equilibrium) non-criticalstrings, which is characterized by eventual ``graceful'' exit from a de Sitterphase. The model is based on a type-0 string theory, involving D3 brane worlds,whose initial quantum fluctuations induce the non criticality. We argue in thisarticle that this model is compatible with the current observations. A crucialr\^ole for the correct ``phenomenology'' of the model is played by the relativemagnitude of the flux of the five form of the type 0 string to the size of fiveof the extra dimensions, transverse to the direction of the flux-field. We donot claim, at this stage at least, that this model is a realistic physicalmodel for the Universe, but we find it interesting that the model cannot beruled out immediately, at least on phenomenological grounds.
