The isometry algebras of the maximally supersymmetric solutions of IIBsupergravity are derived by the Inonu-Wigner contractions of thesuper-AdS_5xS^5 algebra. The super-AdS_5xS^5 algebra allows introducing twocontraction parameters; the one for the Penrose limit to the maximallysupersymmetric pp-wave algebra and the AdS_5xS^5 radius for the flat limit. Thefact that the Jacobi identity of three supercharges holds irrespectively ofthese parameters reflects the fact that the number of supersymmetry is notaffected under both contractions.
