In this paper we extend Schwinger's quantization approach to the case of asupermanifold considered as a coset space of the Poincare group by the Lorentzgroup. In terms of coordinates parametrizing a supermanifold, quantum mechanicsfor a superparticle is constructed. As in models related to the usualRiemannian manifold, the key role in analyzes is played by Killing vectors. Themain feature of quantum theory on the supermanifold consists of the fact thatthe spatial coordinates are not commute with each other and therefore arerepresented on wave functions by integral operators.
