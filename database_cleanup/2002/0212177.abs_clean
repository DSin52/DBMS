We construct some N=1 supersymmetric three-family SU(5) Grand Unified Modelsfrom type IIA orientifolds on $\IT^6/(\IZ_2\times \IZ_2)$ with D6-branesintersecting at general angles. These constructions are supersymmetric only forspecial choices of untwisted moduli. We show that within the above class ofconstructions there are no supersymmetric three-family models with 3 copies of{\bf 10}-plets unless there are simultaneously some {\bf 15}-plets. Wesystematically analyze the construction of such models and their spectra. TheM-theory lifts of these brane constructions become purely geometricalsymmetries and three families of chiral fermions are localized at codimension 4and codimension 7 singularities respectively. We also study somepreliminaryphenomenological features of the models.
