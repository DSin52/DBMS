We carry out field redefinitions in ten-dimensional Type IIB supergravity andshow that they do not give rise to any physical corrections to the holographicrenormalization group structure in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We in particularshow that the holographic Weyl anomaly of the N=4 SU(N) super Yang-Mills theorydoes not change under the field redefinition of the ten-dimensional metric ofthe form G_{MN} -> G_{MN}+\alpha R G_{MN}+\beta R_{MN}. These results areconsistent with the fact that classical supergravity represents the on-shellstructure of massless modes of superstrings, which should not change underredefinitions of fields.
