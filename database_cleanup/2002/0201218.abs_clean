The vertex operators for the supergravity multiplet can be constructedthrough the Wilson lines in IIB matrix model. We investigate the structure ofthe vertex operators and the symmetry of their correlation functions. For thispurpose, we perturb the theory by the Wilson lines dual to the supergravitymultiplet. The structure of the Wilson lines can be determined by requiring$\cal{N}$=2 SUSY under the low energy approximation. We argue that thegenerating functional of the correlators is invariant under local SUSYtransformations of IIB supergravity.
