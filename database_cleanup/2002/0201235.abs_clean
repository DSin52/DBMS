Chiral condensates in the trivial light-cone vacuum emerge if defined asshort-time limits of fermion propagators. In gauge theories, the necessaryinclusion of a gauge string in combination with the characteristic light-coneinfrared singularities contain the relevant non-perturbative ingredientsresponsible for formation of the condensate, as demonstrated for the 't Hooftmodel.
