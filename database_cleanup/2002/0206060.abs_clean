We study scalar solitons on the fuzzy sphere at arbitrary radius andnoncommutativity. We prove that no solitons exist if the radius is below acertain value. Solitons do exist for radii above a critical value which dependson the noncommutativity parameter. We construct a family of soliton solutionswhich are stable and which converge to solitons on the Moyal plane in anappropriate limit. These solutions are rotationally symmetric about an axis andhave no allowed deformations. Solitons that describe multiple lumps on thefuzzy sphere can also be constructed but they are not stable.
