We consider bulk tachyon condensations in a non-linear sigma model whose lowenergy effective theory contains a nontrivial scalar potential. We argue thatone would typically encounter a strong coupling background along a RG flowcorresponding to a bulk tachyon condensation, beyond which the RG analysiswould not be reliable. In a range of the flow in which the string couplingconstant is small, we can show that the tachyon condensation actually decreasesthe central charge of the sigma model.
