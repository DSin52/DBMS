We investigate a \Pi-shape Wilson loop in N=4 super Yang--Mills theory, whichlies partially at the light-cone, and consider an associated open superstringin AdS_5 x S^5. We discuss how this Wilson loop determines the anomalousdimensions of conformal operators with large Lorentz spin and present anexplicit calculation in perturbation theory to order \lambda. We find theminimal surface in the supergravity approximation, that reproduces the Gubser,Klebanov and Polyakov prediction for the anomalous dimensions at large\lambda=g_YM^2 N, and discuss its quantum-mechanical interpretation.
