We investigate colliding processes of closed strings with large angularmomenta with D-branes. We give explicit CFT calculations for closed stringstates with an arbitrary number of bosonic excitations and no or one fermionexcitation. The results reproduce the correspondence between closed stringstates and single trace operators in the boundary gauge theory recentlysuggested by Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase.
