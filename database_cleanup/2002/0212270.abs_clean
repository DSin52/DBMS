Title: Noncommutative gravity

Authors: Yasuhiro Abe and V.P. Nair

Comments: LaTeX, 11 pages

Gravity on noncommutative analogues of compact spaces can give a finite modetruncation of ordinary commutative gravity. We obtain the action for gravity onthe noncommutative two-sphere in terms of finite dimensional $(N\timesN)$-matrices and discuss the commutative large $N$ limit.
