It is well known that modifications to the Friedmann equation on a warpedbrane in an anti de Sitter bulk do not provide any low energy distinguishingfeature from standard cosmology. However, addition of a brane curvature scalarin the action produces effects which can serve as a distinctive feature ofbrane world scenarios and can be tested with observations. The fitting of sucha model with supernovae Ia data (including SN 1997ff at $z\approx1.7$) comesout very well and predicts an accelerating universe.
