Title: Supersymmetric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models

structure and eigenfunctionsAuthors: P. Desrosiers, L. Lapointe and P. Mathieu

Comments: 15 pages. To appear in the proceedings of the {\it Workshop on

superintegrability in classical and quantum systems}Systems; Quantum AlgebraWe first review the construction of the supersymmetric extension of the(quantum) Calogero-Moser-Sutherland (CMS) models. We stress the remarkable factthat this extension is completely captured by the insertion of a fermionicare nothing but special exchange-type CMS models. Under the appropriateprojection, the conserved charges can thus be formulated in terms of thestandard Dunkl operators. This is illustrated in the rational case, where theexplicit form of the $4N$ ($N$ being the number of bosonic variables) conservedcharges is presented, together with their full algebra. The existence of $2N$commuting bosonic charges settles the question of the integrability of thesrCMS model. We then prove its superintegrability by displaying $2N-2$ extraindependent charges commuting with the Hamiltonian. In the second part, weconsider the supersymmetric version of the trigonometric case (stCMS model) andreview the construction of its eigenfunctions, the Jack superpolynomials. Thisleads to closed-form expressions, as determinants of determinants involvingsupermonomial symmetric functions. Here we focus on the main ideas and thesupersymmetric or not. Finally, the possible Lie superalgebraic structureunderlying the stCMS model and its eigenfunctions is briefly considered.
