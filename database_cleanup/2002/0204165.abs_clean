In the Seiberg-Witten limit, the low-energy dynamics of N weakly coupledidentical open strings on a D3-brane can behave as two-dimensionalincompressible hydrodynamics. Classical vortices are frozen in the fluid anddescribed by an action expressed in terms of two canonical conjugate fields,which can be taken as the new space coordinate. The noncommutative spacenaturally arises when this pair of conjugate fields are quantized. To thelowest order of $\hbar$, the vorticity can replace the background $B$-field onthe D3 brane, thereby yielding a spatially and temporally varyingnoncommutative parameter $\theta^{ij}$. Demanding a quantum area-preservingtransformation between two classical inertial-frame coordinates, we identifythe classical solitons that survive in the noncommutative space, and they turnout to be the "electric field" solutions of the Dirac-Born-Infeld Lagrangiancreated by a $\delta$-function source. The strongly magnetized electron gas ina semiconductor of finite thickness is taken as a case study, where similarquantum column vortices as those in a D3 brane can be present. The electriccharges contained in these electron-gas column vortices are quantized, but in away different from those in the sheet vortices that produce the fractionalquantum Hall effect.
