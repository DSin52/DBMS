We show that the $E-S \sim \log S$ behaviour found for long strings rotatingon $AdS_5\times S^5$ may be reproduced by membranes rotating on $AdS_4\timesS^7$ and on a warped $AdS_5$ M-theory solution. We go on to obtain rotatingmembrane configurations with the same $E-K \sim \log K$ relation on $G_2$holonomy backgrounds that are dual to ${\mathcal{N}}=1$ gauge theories in fourdimensions. We study membrane configurations on $G_2$ holonomy backgroundssystematically, finding various other Energy-Charge relations. We end with somecomments about strings rotating on warped backgrounds.
