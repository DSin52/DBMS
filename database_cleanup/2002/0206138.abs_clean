Title: Cosmological Perturbations Through a General Relativistic Bounce

Authors: Christopher Gordon and Neil Turok

Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures. Added more details showing how and when the

comoving curvature perturbation varies on large scales during the bounceThe ekpyrotic and cyclic universe scenarios have revived the idea that thedensity perturbations apparent in today's universe could have been generated ina `pre-singularity' epoch before the big bang. These scenarios provide explicitmechanisms whereby a scale invariant spectrum of adiabatic perturbations may begenerated without the need for cosmic inflation, albeit in a phase precedingthe hot big bang singularity. A key question they face is whether there existsa unique prescription for following perturbations through the bounce, an issuewhich is not yet definitively settled. This goal of this paper is more modest,namely to study a bouncing Universe model in which neither General Relativitynor the Weak Energy Condition is violated. We show that a perturbation which ispure growing mode before the bounce does not match to a pure decaying modeperturbation after the bounce. Analytical estimates of when the comovingcurvature perturbation varies around the bounce are given. It is found that ingeneral it is necessary to evaluate the evolution of the perturbation throughthe bounce in detail rather than using matching conditions.
