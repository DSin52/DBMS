Title: A new, exact, gauge-invariant RG-flow equation

Authors: V. Branchina, K. A. Meissner, G. Veneziano

Comments: 9 pages, no figures

We introduce a scale-dependent effective action defined through a partialLegendre transform first discussed by Zumino more than 30 years ago. This neweffective action depends, at any scale, on all degrees of freedom, isgauge-invariant/general-covariant, and obeys a simple, exact and manifestlygauge-invariant RG-flow equation. It should be useful in a variety of problems,including some pertaining to non-abelian gauge theories and quantum gravity.
