We present a novel global E_7(7) symmetry in five-dimensional maximalsupergravity as well as an E_8(8) symmetry in d=4. These symmetry groups whichare known to be present after reduction to d=4 and d=3, respectively, appear asconformal extensions of the respective well-known hidden-symmetry groups. Aglobal scaling symmetry of the Lagrangian is the key to enhancement of E_6(6)to E_7(7) in d=5 and E_7(7) to E_8(8) in d=4. The group action on the physicalfields is induced by conformal transformations in auxiliary spaces ofdimensions 27 and 56, respectively. The construction is analogous to the onewhere the conformal group of Minkowski space acts on the boundary of AdS_5space. A geometrical picture underlying the action of these ``conformal dualitygroups'' is given.
