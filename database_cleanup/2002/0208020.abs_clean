Much of the recent progress in String Theory can be traced to a precisesubject, and the abstraction from them of basic properties that one would liketo demand from other models. This could be termed a set of "model-buildingrules". The approach corresponds to the fact, often a source of embarrassmentto specialists, that String Theory, born as a set of rules rather than as a setof principles, has long resisted attempts to reduce it to a logicallysatisfying structure.Talk presented at the Cargese Summer Institute on Non-Perturbative Methods inField Theory, Cargese, France, July 16-30, 1987.
