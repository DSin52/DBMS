We use recently proposed translations isometries of pp-waves to construct D4and D3 brane solutions, using T-duality transformations, in exactly solvablepp-wave background originating from $AdS_3\times S^3$ geometry. A uniqueproperty of the new brane solutions is the breaking of SO(10-p-1) symmetry inthe transverse direction of the branes due to the presence of constant NS-NSand R-R background fluxes. We verify that the our `localized' solutions satisfythe field equations and explicitly present the corresponding Killing spinors.We also show the connection of our results to certain M5-branes in pp-wavegeometry.
