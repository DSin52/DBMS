The Casimir effect due to conformally coupled bulk scalar fields onbackground of conformally flat brane-world geometries is investigated. In thegeneral case of mixed boundary conditions formulae are derived for the vacuumexpectation values of the energy-momentum tensor and vacuum forces acting onboundaries. The special case of the AdS bulk is considered and the applicationto the Randall-Sundrum scenario is discussed. The possibility for the radionstabilization by the vacuum forces is demonstrated.
