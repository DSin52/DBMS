We construct a group field theory which realizes the sum of gravityamplitudes over all three dimensional topologies trough a perturbativeexpansion. We prove this theory to be uniquely Borel summable. This shows howto define a non-perturbative summation over triangulations including alltopologies in the context of three dimensional discrete gravity.
