Title: Method of approximation for potentials in impenetrable boxes

Oscillator and Coulomb potentialsComments: Latex, 13 pages

In this work we develop an approach to obtain analytical expressions forpotentials in an impenetrable box. It is illustrated through the particularcases of the harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb potential. In this kind ofsystem the energy expression respect the correct quantum limits, which is avery important quality. The similarity of this kind of problem with the quasiexactly solvable potentials is explored in order to accomplish our goals.
