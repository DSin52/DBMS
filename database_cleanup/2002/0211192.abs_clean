We find new supersymmetric solutions of the massive supergravity theory whichcan be constructed by generalized Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction ofeleven dimensional supergravity, using the scaling symmetry of the equations ofmotion. Firstly, we construct field configurations which solve the tendimensional equations of motion by reducing on the radial direction ofRicci-flat cones. Secondly, we will extend this result to the supersymmetriccase by performing a dimensional reduction along the flow of a homotheticKilling vector which is the Euler vector of the cone plus a boost.
