Induced quantum gravity dynamics built over a Riemann surface is studied inarbitrary dimension. Local coordinates on the target space are given by meansof the Laguerre-Forsyth construction. A simple model is proposed andpertubatively quantized. In doing so, the classical W-symmetry turns out to bepreserved on-shell at any order of the $\hbar$ perturbative expansion. As amain result, due to quantum corrections, the target coordinates acquire anon-trivial character.
