We consider the exact superpotential of N=1 super Yang-Mills theory withgauge group SO(N) and arbitrary tree-level polynomial superpotential of oneadjoint Higgs field. A field-theoretic derivation of the glueballsuperpotential is given, based on factorization of the N=2 Seiberg-Wittencurve. Following the conjecture of Dijkgraaf and Vafa, the result is matchedwith the corresponding SO(N) matrix model prediction. The verification involvesan explicit solution of the first non-trivial loop equation, relating thespherical free energy to that of the non-orientable surfaces with topology$RP^2$.
