A family of SO(10) symmetric instanton solutions in Type IIB supergravity isdeveloped. The instanton of least action is a candidate for the low-energy,semiclassical approximation to the {D=--1} brane. Unlike a previously publishedsolution,[GGP] this admits an interpretation as a tunneling amplitude betweenperturbatively degenerate asymptotic states, but with action twice that foundpreviously. A number of associated issues are discussed such as the relationbetween the magnetic and electric pictures, an inversion symmetry of thedilaton and the metric, the $R\times S^9$ topology of the background, and someproperties of the solution in an "instanton frame" corresponding to aLagrangian in which the dilaton's kinetic energy vanishes.
