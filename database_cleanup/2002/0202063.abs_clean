Title: Dark Energy from Strings

Comments: 10 pages LaTeX. Talk at Coral Gables Conference, December 12-16, 2001

A long-standing problem of theoretical physics is the exceptionally smallvalue of the cosmological constant $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120}$ measured in naturalPlanckian units. Here we derive this tiny number from a toroidal stringcosmology based on closed strings. In this picture the dark energy arises fromthe correlation between momentum and winding modes that for short distances hasan exponential fall-off with increasing values of the momenta. The freeze-outby the expansion of the background universe for these transplanckian modes maybe interpreted as a frozen condensate of the closed-string modes in the threenon-compactified spatial dimensions.
