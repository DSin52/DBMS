of QCD, Stara Lesna, Slovakia, January 2002The new approach to quantum mechanical problems is proposed. Quantum statesare represented in an algebraic program, by lists of variable length, whileoperators are well defined functions on these lists. Complete numericalsolution of a given system can then be automatically obtained. The method isapplied to Wess-Zumino quantum mechanics and D=2 and D=4 supersymmetricYang-Mills quantum mechanics with the SU(2) gauge group. Convergence withincreasing size of the basis was observed in various cases. Many old resultswere confirmed and some new ones, especially for the D=4 system, are derived.Preliminary results in higher dimensions are also presented. In particular thespectrum of the zero-volume glueballs in $ 4 < D < 11 $ is obtained for thefirst time.
