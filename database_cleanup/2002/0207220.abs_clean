changesThe spontaneous symmetry breaking of rotational O(N) symmetry innoncommutative field theory is investigated in a 2+1 dimensional model ofscalar fields coupled through a combination of quartic and sextupleself-interactions. There are five possible orderings of the fields in thesextuple interaction and two for the quartic interaction. At one loop, we provethat for some choices of these orderings there is the absence of IR/UV mixingand the appearance of massless excitations. A supersymmetric extension of themodel is also studied. Supersymmetry puts additional constraints on thecouplings but for any given N there is a Moyal ordering of the superfields forwhich the requirement for the existence of Goldstone bosons is satisfied. Forsome ordering and when N goes to infinity we find evidence that the model isrenormalizable to all orders in perturbation theory. We also consider a genericchiral model in 3+1 dimensions whose superpotential is invariant under localgauge transformations. We find that for any value of N there is no one loopcorrection to the pion mass and that, at two loops, there are no pion masscorrections for slowly varying superfields so that Goldstone theorem holdstrue. We also find a new purely noncommutative coupling which givescontributions starting at order N-2 loops.
