Title: BPS Solutions of Noncommutative Gauge Theories in Four and Eight

DimensionsAuthors: Yoshiki Hiraoka

Comments: 20 pages

We study the 1/4 BPS equations in the eight dimensional noncommutativeYang-Mills theory found by Bak, Lee and Park. We explicitly construct somesolutions of the 1/4 BPS equations using the noncommutative version of theADHM-like construction in eight dimensions. From the calculation of topologicalcharges, we show that our solutions can be interpreted as the bound states ofthe $D0$-$D4$-$D8$ with a $B$-field. We also discuss the structure of themoduli space of the 1/4 BPS solutions and determine the metric of the modulispace of the U(2) one-instanton in four and eight dimensions.
