Title: On explicit solutions for completely integrable classical Calogero-Moser

systems in external fieldsAuthors: D.V.Meshcheryakov, T.D.Meshcheryakova

Explicit solutions for one completely-integrable system of Calogero-Mosertype in external fields are found in case of three and four interactingparticles. Relation between coupling constant, initial values of coordinatesand time of falling into the singularity of potential is derived.
