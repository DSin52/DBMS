The results remain the sameIt is generally believed that inflationary cosmology explains the isotropy,large scale homogeneity and flatness as well as predicting the deviations fromhomogeneity of our universe. We show that this is not the only cosmology whichcan explain successfully these features of the universe. We consider anew andmodify a model in which local Lorentz invariance is spontaneously broken in thevery early universe, and in this epoch the speed of light undergoes a first orsecond order phase transition to a value ~ 30 orders of magnitude smaller,corresponding to the presently measured speed of light. Before the phasetransition at a time t ~ t_c, the entropy of the universe is reduced by manyorders of magnitude, allowing for a semiclassical quantum field theorycalculation of a scale invariant fluctuation spectrum. After the phasetransition has occurred, the radiation density and the entropy of the universeincrease hugely and the increase in the entropy follows the arrow of timedetermined by the spontaneously broken direction of the vev <\phi^a>_0. Thissolves the enigma of the arrow of time and the second law of thermodynamics. Anew calculation of the primordial Gaussian and adiabatic fluctuation spectrumis carried out, leading to a scale invariant scalar component of the powerspectrum. We argue that there are several attractive features of VSL theorycompared to standard inflationary theory, and that it provides an alternativecosmology with potentially different predictions.
