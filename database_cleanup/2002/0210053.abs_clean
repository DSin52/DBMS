We demonstrate the relation between the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism and flippedgauged brane-bulk supergravities in five dimensions. We discuss the form ofsupersymmetry violating Scherk-Schwarz terms in pure supergravity and insupergravity coupled to matter. We point out that brane-induced supersymmetrybreakdown in 5d Horava-Witten model is not of the Scherk-Schwarz type. Wediscuss in detail flipped super-bigravity, which is the locally supersymmetricextension of the (++) bigravity.
