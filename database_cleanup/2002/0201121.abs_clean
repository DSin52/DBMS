We summarise the approach to brane cosmology known as ``mirage cosmology''and use it to determine the Friedmann equation on a 3-brane embedded indifferent bulk spacetimes all with one or more extra dimensions. Usually, whenthere is more than one extra dimension the junction conditions, central to theusual brane world scenarios, are difficult to apply. This problem does notarise in mirage cosmology because the brane is treated as a ``test particle''in the background spacetime. We discuss in detail the dynamics of a braneembedded in two specific 10D bulk spacetimes, namely Sch-AdS$_5 \times$S$_5$and a rotating black hole, and from the dynamics--which are now rather morecomplicated since the brane can move in all the extra dimensions--determine thenew ``dark fluid'' terms in the brane Friedmann equation. Some of these, suchas the cosmological constant term, are seen to be bulk dependent. However, forboth bulks we show that there exists a critical brane angular momentum,$\ell_c$, and discuss its significance. We then show explicitly how this miragecosmology approach matches with the familiar junction condition approach whenthere is just one extra dimension. The issue of a varying speed of light inmirage cosmology is reviewed and we find a scenario in which $c_{\bf eff}$always increases, tending asymptotically to a constant $c_0$ as the universeexpands. Finally some comments are made regarding brane inflation andlimitations of the mirage cosmology approach are also discussed.
