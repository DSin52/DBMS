A quantum treatment of spontaneous symmetry breaking in scalar light frontfield theories is formulated. It is based on a finite-volume quantization withantiperiodic boundary conditions for scalar fields. This avoids a necessity tosolve the zero mode constraint and simultaneously enables one to define aunitary operator which shifts the scalar field by a constant. The operatortransforms the light-front vacuum into a coherent-state vacuum that minimizesthe light front energy and leads to a spontaneous breakdown of the discrete orcontinuous symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Simple theories of a self-interactingreal scalar field in two dimensions and of a complex scalar field in threedimensions are analyzed in this way including a discussion of the Goldstonetheorem.
