Comments: Presentation style improved, typos removed, discussion extended,

physical interpretation of the result is givenWe discuss the continuum limits of Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase matrix model.They give rise to Poisson bracket gauge field theories on the ordinary twosphere or on a set of two spheres with a gauge groups U(n) depending on thedegeneracy of the classical solution about which the model is considered. Weshow that these models fail to be equivalent among each other in the continuumlimit.
