Authors: K. Shima, M. Tsuda and M. Sawaguchi

Comments: 9 pages, Latex

Refering to the supermultiplet of the supergravity(SUGRA) the linearizationof SGM action describing the nonlinear supersymmetric(NL SUSY) gravitationalinteraction of superon(Nambu-Goldstone(N-G) fermion) is attempted. The fieldcontents of on-shell SUGRA supermultiplet are realized as the composites,though they have new SUSY transformations which closes on super-Poincar\'ealgebra. Particular attentions are paid to the local Lorentz invariance.
