We consider stationary axially symmetric black holes in SU(2)Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. We present a mass formula for thesestationary non-Abelian black holes, which also holds for Abelian black holes.The presence of the dilaton field allows for rotating black holes, whichpossess non-trivial electric and magnetic gauge fields, but don't carry anon-Abelian charge.
