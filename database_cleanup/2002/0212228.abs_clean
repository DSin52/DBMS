Title: Semiclassical Quantization of Giant Gravitons

Authors: Peter Ouyang

Comments: 21 pages, 8 figures

We study excited spherical branes (``giant gravitons'') in $AdS \times S$spacetimes with background flux. For large excitation, these branes may betreated semiclassically. We compute their spectra using Bohr-Sommerfeldquantization and use the AdS/CFT correspondence to relate them to anomalousdimensions in the dual field theory at strong coupling, expressed as a seriesexpansion in powers of 1/N. These effects resemble those due to $k$-body forcesbetween quarks in Hartree-Fock models of baryons at large $N$. For branesexpanded in AdS, we argue that the anomalous dimensions are due to loopcorrections to the effective action.
