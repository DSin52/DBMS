Title: Overcoming Nonrenormalizability

Comments: 15 pages, Version to appear in Letters in Mathematical Physics

A suitable counterterm for a Euclidean space lattice version of \phi^4_ntheories, n\ge 4, is combined with several additional procedures so that in thecontinuum limit the resultant quantum field theory is nontrivial. Arguments tosupport this unconventional choice are presented.
