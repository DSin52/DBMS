We find that dilaton dominated supersymmetry breaking and spontaneous CPviolation can be achieved in heterotic string models with superpotentialssingular at the fixed points of the modular group. A semi--realistic picture ofof the T-modulus, while the soft supersymmetric CP phases are absent due to anaxionic--type symmetry.
