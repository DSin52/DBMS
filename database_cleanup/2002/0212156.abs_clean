minor changes in Sections 4 & 6The Epstein--Glaser type T-subtraction introduced by one of the authors inaprevious paper is extended to the Lorentz invariant framework. The advantageof using our subtraction instead of Epstein and Glaser's standard W-subtractionmethod is especially important when working in Minkowski space, as then thecounterterms necessary to keep Lorentz invariance are simplified. We show howT-renormalization of primitive diagrams in the Lorentz invariant frameworkdirectly relates to causal Riesz distributions. A covariant subtraction rule inmomentum space is found, sharply improving upon the BPHZL method for masslesstheories.
