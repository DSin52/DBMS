Cargese ASI, "Progress in String, Field and Particle Theory", June-July 2002This is a very brief review of some results from hep-th/0112154 andhep-th/0209191. In holographic renormalization, we studied the RG flow of a 2dN=(4,4) CFT perturbed by a relevant operator, flowing to a conformal fixedpoint in the IR. Here, the supergravity dual is displayed, and the computationof correlators is discussed. The sample stress-energy correlator given hereprovides an opportunity to explicitly compare Zamolodchikov's C-function to theproposal for a "holographic C-function".
