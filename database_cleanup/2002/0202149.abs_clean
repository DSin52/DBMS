We construct the hyperkahler cones corresponding to the Quaternion-Kahlerorthogonal Wolf spaces SO(n+4)/(SO(n)xSO(4)) and their non-compact versions,which appear in hypermultiplet couplings to N=2 supergravity. The geometry iscompletely encoded by a single function, the hyperkahler potential, which wecompute from an SU(2) hyperkahler quotient of flat space. We derive the Killingvectors and moment maps for the SO(n+4) isometry group on the hyperkahler cone.For the non-compact case, the isometry group SO(n,4) contains n+2 abelianisometries which can be used to find a dual description in terms of n tensormultiplets and one double-tensor multiplet. Finally, using a representation ofthe hyperkahler quotient via quiver diagrams, we deduce the existence of a neweight dimensional ALE space.
