The instanton partition function of N=2, D=4 SU(2) gauge theory is obtainedby taking the field theory limit of the topological open string partitionfunction, given by a Chern-Simons theory, of a CY3-fold. The CY3-fold on theopen string side is obtained by geometric transition from local F_0 which isused in the geometric engineering of the SU(2) theory. The partition functionobtained from the Chern-Simons theory agrees with the closed topological stringpartition function of local F_0 proposed recently by Nekrasov. We also obtainthe partition functions for local F_1 and F_2 CY3-folds and show that thetopological string amplitudes of all local Hirzebruch surfaces give rise to thesame field theory limit. It is shown that a generalization of the topologicalclosed string partition function whose field theory limit is the generalizationof the instanton partition function, proposed by Nekrasov, can be determinedeasily from the Chern-Simons theory.
