A direct relation between two types of topological field theories,Chern-Simons theory and BF theory, is presented by using ``GeneralizedDifferential Calculus'', which extends an ordinary p-form to an ordered pair ofp and (p+1)-form. We first establish the generalized Chern-Weil homomormism forgeneralized curvature invariant polynomials in general even dimensionalmanifolds, and then show that BF gauge theory can be obtained from the actionwhich is the generalized second Chern class with gauge group G. Particularlywhen G is taken as SL(2,C) in four dimensions, general relativity withcosmological constant can be derived by constraining the topological BF theory.
