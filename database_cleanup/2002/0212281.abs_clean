We analyze the construction of non-supersymmetric three generation six-stackPati-Salam (PS) $SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ GUT classes of models,by localizing D6-branes intersecting at angles in four dimensionalorientifolded toroidal compactifications of type IIA. Special role in themodels is played by the presence of extra branes needed to satisfy the RRtadpole cancellation conditions. The models contain at low energy {\em exactlythe Standard model} with no extra matter and/or extra gauge group factors. Theyare build such that they represent deformations around the quark and leptonbasic intersection number structure. The models possess the samephenomenological characteristics of some recently discussed examples (PS-A,PS-I; PS-II GUT classes; hep-th/0203187, hep-th/0209202; hep-th/0210004) offour and five stack PS GUTS respectively. Namely, there are no colour tripletcouplings to mediate proton decay and proton is stable as baryon number is agauged symmetry.The mass relation $m_e = m_d$ at the GUT scale is recovered. Even though morecomplicated, than in lower stack GUTS, the conditions of the non-anomalousU(1)'s to survive massless the generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism are solvedconsistently by the angle conditions coming from the presence of N=1supersymmetric sectors involving the presence of {\em extra} branes and alsorequired for the existence of a Majorana mass term for the right handedneutrinos.
