We examine a bilinear form Wess-Zumino term for a superstring in anti-deSitter (AdS) spaces. This is composed of two parts; a bilinear term insuperinvariant currents and a total derivative bilinear term which is requiredfor the pseudo-superinvariance of the Wess-Zumino term. The covariantsupercharge commutator containing a string charge is also obtained.
