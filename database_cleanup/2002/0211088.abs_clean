Two families of sets, nonstationary and stationary, are obtained. Eachnonstationary set $\psi_{p_v}$ consists of the solutions with the quantumnumber $p_v=p^0v-p_3.$ It can be obtained from the nonstationary set$\psi_{p_3}$ with quantum number $p_3$ by a boost along $x_3$-axis (along thedirection of the electric field) with velocity $-v$. Similarly, any stationaryset of solutions characterized by a quantum number $p_s=p^0-sp_3$ can beobtained from stationary solutions with quantum number $p^0$ by the same boostwith velocity $-s$. All these sets are equivalent and the classification (i.e.ascribing the frequency sign and in-, out- indexes) in any set is determined bythe classification in $\psi_{p_3}$-set, where it is beyond doubt.
