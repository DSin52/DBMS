The nullification of threshold amplitudes is considered within theconventional framework of quantum field theory. The relevant Ward identitiesfor the reduced theory are derived both on path-integral and diagrammaticlevels. They are then used to prove the vanishing of tree-graph thresholdamplitudes.
