We calculate small correction terms to gravitational potential onRandall-Sundrum brane with an induced Einstein term. The behaviors of thecorrection terms depend on the magnitudes of $AdS$ radius $k^{-1}$ and acharacteristic length scale $\l$ of model. We represent the gravitationalpotential for arbitrary $k$ and $\l$ at all distances.
