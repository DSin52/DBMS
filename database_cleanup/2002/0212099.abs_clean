We investigate the quantum consistency of p-form Maxwell-Chern-Simonselectrodynamics in 3p+2 spacetime dimensions (for p odd). These are thedimensions where the Chern--Simons term is cubic, i.e., of the form FFA. Forthe theory to be consistent at the quantum level in the presence of magneticand electric sources, we find that the Chern--Simons coupling constant must bequantized. We compare our results with the bosonic sector of eleven dimensionalsupergravity and find that the Chern--Simons coupling constant in that casetakes its corresponding minimal allowed value.
