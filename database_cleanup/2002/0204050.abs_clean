We compute the moduli space metric of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory with N=2supersymmetry in the vicinity of the point where the classical moduli vanish.This gauge theory may be realized as a set of N D7-branes wrapping a K3surface, near the enhancon locus. The moduli space metric determines thelow-energy worldvolume dynamics of the D7 branes near this point, includingstringy corrections. Non-abelian gauge symmetry is not restored on theworldvolume at the enhancon point, but rather the gauge group remainsU(1)^{N-1} and light electric and magnetically charged particles coexist. Wealso study the moduli space metric for a single probe brane in the backgroundof N-1 branes near the enhancon point. We find quantum corrections to thesupergravity probe metric that are not suppressed at large separations, but aredown by 1/N factors, due to the response of the N-1 enhancon branes to theprobe. A singularity appears before the probe reaches the enhancon point wherea dyon becomes massless. We compute the masses of W-bosons and monopoles in alarge N limit near this critical point.
