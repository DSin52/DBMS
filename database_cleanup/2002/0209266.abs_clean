in PRDWe study the quantum moduli spaces and dynamical superpotentials of fourdimensional $SU(2)^r$ linear and ring moose theories with $\mathcal{N}=1$supersymmetry and link chiral superfields in the fundamental representation.Nontrivial quantum moduli spaces and dynamical superpotentials are produced.When the moduli space is perturbed by generic tree level superpotentials, thevacuum space becomes discrete. The ring moose is in the Coulomb phase and wefind two singular submanifolds with a nontrivial modulus that is a function ofall the independent gauge invariants needed to parameterize the quantum modulispace. The massive theory near these singularities confines. The Seiberg-Wittenelliptic curve that describes the quantum moduli space of the ring moose isproduced.
