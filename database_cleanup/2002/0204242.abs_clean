We consider spacetime with torsion in a Randall-Sundrum (RS) scenario wheretorsion, identified with the rank-2 Kalb-Ramond field, exists in the bulktogether with gravity. While the interactions of both graviton and torsion inthe bulk are controlled by the Planck mass, an additional exponentialsuppression comes for the torsion zero-mode on the visible brane. This mayserve as a natural explanation of why the effect of torsion is so much weakerthan that of curvature on the brane. The massive torsion modes, on the otherhand, are correlated with the corresponding gravitonic modes and may bedetectable in TeV-scale experiments.
