Unification ideas motivate the formulation of field equations on an extendedspin space. Demanding that the Poincare symmetry be maintained, one derivesscalar symmetries that are associated with flavor and gauge groups. Boson andfermion solutions are obtained with a fixed representation. A field theory canbe equivalently written and interpreted in terms of elements of such space andis similarly constrained. At 5+1 dimensions, one obtains isospin andhypercharge SU(2)_L X U(1) symmetries, their vector carriers, two-flavorcharged and chargeless leptons, and scalar particles. Mass terms producebreaking of the symmetry to an electromagnetic U(1), a Weinberg's angle withsin^2(theta_W)=.25, and additional information on the respective couplingconstants. Their underlying spin symmetry gives information on the particles'masses; one reproduces the standard-model ratio M_Z/M_W, and predicts a Higgsmass of M_H ~114 GeV, at tree level.
