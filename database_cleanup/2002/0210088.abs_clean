Title: Magnetized (Shift-)Orientifolds

Authors: Gianfranco Pradisi

Comments: LaTeX file, 8 pages, based on the talk presented at the ``First

International Conference On String Phenomenology'', Oxford, 6-11 july 2002We study four dimensional $Z_2 \times Z_2$ (shift)-orientifolds in presenceof internal magnetic fields and NS-NS $B$-field backgrounds, describing in somedetail one explicit example with N=1 supersymmetry. These models are related by$T$-duality to orientifolds with $D$-branes intersecting at angles and exhibit,due to the background fields, a rank reduction of the gauge group and multiplematter families. Moreover, the low-energy spectra are chiral and anomaly freeif $D5$-branes are present along the magnetized directions.
