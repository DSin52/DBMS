The explicit form of the fermionic zero-modes in the fivebrane backgrounds oftype IIA and IIB supergravity theories is investigated. In type IIA fivebranebackground there are four zero-modes of gravitinos and dilatinos. In type IIBfivebrane background four zero-modes of dilatinos and no zero-modes ofgravitinos are found. These zero-modes indicate the four-fermion condensateswhich have been suggested in a calculation of the tension of the D-brane infivebrane backgrounds.
