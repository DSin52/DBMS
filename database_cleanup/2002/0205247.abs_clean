We discuss the low energy effective action for the Bosonic and Fermioniczero-modes of a smooth BPS Randall-Sundrum domain wall, including the inducedsupergravity on the wall. The result is a pure supergravity in one lowerdimension. In particular, and in contrast to non-gravitational domain walls ordomain walls in a compact space, the zero-modes representing transversefluctuations of domain wall have vanishing action.
