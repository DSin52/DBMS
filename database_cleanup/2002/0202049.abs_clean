In this letter we address the problem of inducing boundary degrees of freedomfrom a bulk theory whose action contains higher-derivative corrections. As amodel example we consider a topological theory with an action that has only a``higher-derivative'' term. By choosing specific coupling of the brane to thebulk we show that the boundary action contains gravity action along with somehigher-derivative corrections. The co-dimension of the brane is more than one.In this sense the boundary is singular.
