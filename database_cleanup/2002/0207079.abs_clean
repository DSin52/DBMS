Title: Boundary reduction formula

Authors: Z. Bajnok, G. Bohm and G. Takacs

Comments: 12 pages, Latex2e file with 5 eps figures, two Appendices about the

boundary Feynman rules and the structure of the two point functions are addedAn asymptotic theory is developed for general non-integrable boundary quantumfield theory in 1+1 dimensions based on the Langrangean description. Reflectionmatrices are defined to connect asymptotic states and are shown to be relatedto the Green functions via the boundary reduction formula derived. Thedefinition of the $R$-matrix for integrable theories due to Ghoshal andZamolodchikov and the one used in the perturbative approaches are shown to berelated.
