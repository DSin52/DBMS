The problem of decomposition of unitary irreps of (super) tensorial (i.e.extended with tensorial charges) Poincar{\'e} algebra w.r.t. its differentsubalgebras is considered. This requires calculation of little groups fordifferent configurations of tensor charges. Particularly, for preon states(i.e. states with maximal supersymmetry) in different dimensions the particlecontent is calculated, i.e. the spectrum of usual Poincar{\'e} representationsin the preon representation of tensorial Poincar{\'e}. At d=4 results coincidewith (and may provide another point of view on) the Vasiliev's results in fieldtheories in generalized space-time. The translational subgroup of little groupsof massless particles and branes is shown to be (and coincide with, at d=4) asubgroup of little groups of "pure branes" algebras, i.e. tensorialPoincar{\'e} algebras without vector generators. At 11d it is shown that,contrary to lower dimensions, spinors are not homogeneous space of Lorentzgroup, and one have to distinguish at least 7 different kinds of preons.
