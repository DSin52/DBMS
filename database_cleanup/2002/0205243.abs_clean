Using well known Lagrangean techniques for uncovering the gauge symmetries ofa Lagrangean, we derive the transformation laws for the phase space variablescorresponding to local symmetries of the Hamilton equations of motion. Thesetransformation laws are shown to coincide with those derived by Hamiltonianmethods based on the Dirac conjecture. The connection between the Lagrangeanand Hamiltonian approach is illustrated for first class systems involving oneprimary constraint.
