Title: On mixed phases in gauge theories

Comments: Latex, 19 pages; Talk given at "Continuous Advances in

QCD-2002/Arkadyfest", honoring the 60-th birthday of Arkady Vainshtein; 17-23extended, and other minor correctionsIn many gauge theories at different values of parameters entering Lagrangian,the vacuum is dominated by coherent condensates of different mutually non-localfields (for instance, by condensates of electric or magnetic charges, or byvarious dyons). It is argued that the transition between these "dual to eachother" phases proceeds through the intermediate "mixed phase", havingN=1 SYM, N=1 SQCD, and broken N=2 SYM and SQCD.
