We present an explicit evidence that shows the correspondence between thetype IIB supergravity in the pp-wave background and its dual supersymmetricYang-Mills theory at the interaction level. We first construct the cubic termof the light-cone interaction Hamiltonian for the dilaton-axion sector of thesupergravity. Our result agrees with the corresponding part of the light-conestring field theory (SFT) and furthermore fixes its previously undetermined$p^+$-dependent normalization. Adopting thus fixed light-cone SFT, we computethe matrix elements of light-cone Hamiltonian involving three chiral primarystates and find an agreement with a prediction from the dual Yang-Mills theory.
