Title: Trace Anomaly and Backreaction of the Dynamical Casimir Effect

Authors: M.R. Setare

The Casimir energy for massless scalar field which satisfies priodic boundaryconditions in two-dimensional domain wall background is calculated by makinguse of general properties of renormalized stress-tensor. The line element ofdomain wall is time dependent, the trace anomaly which is the nonvanishing$T^{\mu}_{\mu}$ for a conformally invariant field after renormalization,represents the back reaction of the dynamical Casimir effect.
