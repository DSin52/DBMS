Sec II have been clarifiedWe compute the conserved quantities of the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman-dS(KNdS) black hole through the use of dS/CFT correspondence, and obtain ageneralized Smarr formula for the mass as a function of the entropy, theangular momentum and the electric charge. The first law of thermodynamicsassociated to the cosmological horizon of KNdS is also investigated. Using theminimal number of intrinsic boundary counterterms, we consider the quasilocalthermodynamics of asymptotic de Sitter Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, and findthat the temperature is equal to the product of the surface gravity (divided by$2\pi$) and the Tolman redshift factor. We also perform a quasilocal stabilityanalysis by computing the determinant of Hessian matrix of the energy withrespect to its thermodynamic variables in both the canonical and thegrand-canonical ensembles and obtain a complete set of phase diagrams. We thenturn to the quasilocal thermodynamics of four-dimensional Kerr-Newman-de Sitterblack hole for virtually all possible values of the mass, the rotation and thecharge parameters that leave the quasilocal boundary inside the cosmologicalevent horizon, and perform a quasilocal stability analysis of KNdS black hole.
