We continue the development of the actions, S_{AFF}, by examining the caseswhere there are N fermionic degrees of freedom associated with a 0-brane. Theseactions correspond to the interaction of the N-extended super Virasoro algebrawith the supergraviton and the associated SO(N) gauge field that accompaniesthe supermultiplet. The superfield formalism is used throughout so thatsupersymmetry is explicit.
