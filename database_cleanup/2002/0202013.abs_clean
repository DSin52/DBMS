The nonperturbative fermion-boson vertex function in four-dimensional Abeliangauge theories is self-consistently and exactly derived in terms of a completeset of normal (longitudinal) and transverse Ward-Takahashi relations for theThe nonperturbative fermion-boson vertex function in four-dimensional Abeliangauge theories is self-consistently and exactly derived in terms of a completeset of normal(longitudinal) and transverse Ward-Takahashi relations for thefermion-boson and the axial-vector vertices in the case of massless fermion, inwhich the possible quantum anomalies and perturbative corrections are takeninto account simultaneously. We find that this nonperturbative fermion-bosonvertex function is expressed nonperturbatively in terms of the full fermionpropagator and contains the contributions of the transverse axial anomaly andperturbative corrections. The result that the transverse axial anomalycontributes to the nonperturbative fermion-boson vertex arises from thecoupling between the fermion-boson and the axial-vector vertices through thetransverse Ward-Takahashi relations for them and is a consequence of gaugeinvariance.
