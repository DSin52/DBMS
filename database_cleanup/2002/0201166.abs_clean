We investigate the possibility of mixing between open and closed stringexcitations in D-brane models with the fundamental string scale at the TeV. Theopen string modes describe the Standard Model Higgs, while closed stringsdescribe graviscalars living in the bulk. This provides a string setup forcomputing the Higgs-graviscalar mixing, that leads to a phenomenologicallyinteresting invisible width of the Higgs in low scale quantum gravity models,as suggested previously by Giudice, Rattazzi and Wells.
