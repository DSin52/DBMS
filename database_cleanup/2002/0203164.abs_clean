We argue that the gauge theory dual to the Type IIB string theory inten-dimensional pp-wave background can be thought to `live' on an {\itEuclidean} subspace spanning four of the eight transverse coordinates. We thenshow that light-cone time evolution of the string is identifiable as the RGflow of the gauge theory -- a relation facilitating `holography' of the pp-wavebackground. The `holography' reorganizes the dual gauge theory into theoriesdefined over Hilbert subspaces of fixed R-charge. The reorganization breaks theSO(4,2)$\times$SO(6) symmetry to a maximal subgroup SO(4)$\times$ SO(4)spontaneously. We argue that the low-energy string modes may be regarded asGoldstone modes resulting from such symmetry breaking pattern.
