A first-order `BPS' equation is obtained for 1/8 supersymmetric intersectionsof soliton-membranes (lumps) of supersymmetric (4+1)-dimensional massless sigmamodels, and a special non-singular solution is found that preserves 1/4supersymmetry. For 4-dimensional hyper-K\"ahler target spaces ($HK_4$) the BPSequation is shown to be the low-energy limit of the equation for aCayley-calibrated 4-surface in $\bE^4\times HK_4$. Similar first-orderequations are found for stationary intersections of Q-lump-membranes of themassive sigma model, but now generic solutions preserve either 1/8supersymmetry or no supersymmetry, depending on the time orientation.
