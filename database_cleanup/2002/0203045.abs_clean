finite temperature and densityComments: 8 pages

Journal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A17 (2002) 303-307

Two forms are available for the fermion propagator at finite temperature anddensity. It is shown that, when one deals with a diquark-condensation-operatorinserted Green function in hot and dense QCD, the standard form of the quarkpropagator does not work. On the other hand, another form of the quarkpropagator does work.
