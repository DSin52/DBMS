We investigate factorized scattering from a reflecting and transmittingimpurity. Bulk scattering is non trivial, provided that the bulk scatteringmatrix depends separately on the spectral parameters of the collidingparticles, and not only on their difference. We show that a specific extensionof a boundary algebra encodes the underlying scattering theory. The totalscattering operator is constructed in this framework and shown to be unitary.
