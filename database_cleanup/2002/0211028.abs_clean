Using recently developed numerical methods, we examine neutral compactifiednon-uniform black strings which connect to the Gregory-Laflamme critical point.By studying the geometry of the horizon we give evidence that this branch ofsolutions may connect to the black hole solutions, as conjectured by Kol. Wefind the geometry of the topology changing solution is likely to be nakedlysingular at the point where the horizon radius is zero. We show that thesesolutions can all be expressed in the coordinate system discussed by Harmarkand Obers.
