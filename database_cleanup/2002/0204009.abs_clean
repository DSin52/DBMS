Two-dimensional hybrid superstring on singular Calabi-Yau manifolds isstudied by the field redefinition of the NSR formalism. The compactification onsingular Calabi-Yau fourfold is described by N=2 super-Liouville theory and N=2Landau-Ginzburg models. We examine the world-sheet topological N=4superconformal algebra, which is useful to identify physical states of thetheory. It is shown that the space-time superconformal symmetry is notcompatible with this original topological algebra. A new model is proposed bymodifying the topological superconformal generators, which is consistent withspace-time N=2 superconformal symmetry.
