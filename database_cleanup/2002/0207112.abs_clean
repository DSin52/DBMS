Title: Comment on "Supersymmetry in the half-oscillator - revisited"

Authors: Ashok Das and S. Pernice

Comments: 2 pages

We point out the flaw in the analysis of Gangopadhyaya and Mallow,hep-th/0206133, where it is claimed that supersymmetry is broken in the SUSYhalf-oscillator, even with a regularization respecting supersymmetry.
