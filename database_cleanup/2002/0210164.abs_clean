The properties of a noncanonical 3D Wigner quantum oscillator, whose positionand momentum operators generate the Lie superalgebra sl(1|3), are furtherinvestigated. Within each state space W(p), p=1,2,..., the energy E_q,q=0,1,2,3, takes no more than 4 different values. If the oscillator is in astationary state \psi_q \in W(p) then measurements of the non-commutingCartesian coordinates of the particle are such that their allowed values areconsistent with it being found at a finite number of sites, called ``nests''.These lie on a sphere centered on the origin of fixed, finite radius \varrho_q.The nests themselves are at the vertices of a rectangular parallelepiped. Inthe typical cases (p>2) the number of nests is 8 for q=0 and 3, and varies from8 to 24, depending on the state, for q=1 and 2. The number of nests is less inthe atypical cases (p=1,2), but it is never less than two. In certain states inW(2) (resp. in W(1)) the oscillator is ``polarized'' so that all the nests lieon a plane (resp. on a line). The particle cannot be localized in any one ofthe available nests alone since the coordinates do not commute. Theprobabilities of measuring particular values of the coordinates are discussed.The mean trajectories and the standard deviations of the coordinates andmomenta are computed, and conclusions are drawn about uncertainty relations.The rotational invariance of the system is also discussed.
