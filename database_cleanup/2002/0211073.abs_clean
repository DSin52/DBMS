Field theories on the plane wave background are considered. We discuss thatfor such field theories one can only form 1+1 dimensional freely propagatingwave packets. We analyze tree level four point functions of scalar field theoryas well as scalars coupled to gauge fields in detail and show that these fourpoint functions are well-behaved so that they can be interpreted as S-matrixelements for 2 particle $\to$ 2 particle scattering amplitudes. Therefore, atleast classically, field theories on the plane wave background do have S-matrixformulation.
