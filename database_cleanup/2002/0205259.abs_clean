Title: Inflationary Theory versus Ekpyrotic/Cyclic Scenario

Authors: Andrei Linde

Comments: 22 pages, 8 figs, a talk at Stephen Hawking's 60th birthday

conference, Cambridge University, Jan. 2002I will discuss the development of inflationary theory and its present status,as well as some recent attempts to suggest an alternative to inflation. Inparticular, I will argue that the ekpyrotic scenario in its original form doesnot solve any of the major cosmological problems. Meanwhile, the cyclicscenario is not an alternative to inflation but rather a complicated version ofinflationary theory. This scenario does not solve the flatness and entropyproblems, and it suffers from the singularity problem. We describe many otherproblems that need to be resolved in order to realize a cyclic regime in thisscenario, produce density perturbations of a desirable magnitude, and preservethem after the singularity. We propose several modifications of this scenarioand conclude that the best way to improve it is to add a usual stage ofinflation after the singularity and use that inflationary stage to generateperturbations in the standard way. This modification significantly simplifiesthe cyclic scenario, eliminates all of its numerous problems, and makes itequivalent to the usual chaotic inflation scenario.
