Conference, Moscow 2002We present a new approach to the quantization of the superstring. After abrief review of the classical Green-Schwarz formulation for the superstring andBerkovits' approach to its quantization based on pure spinors, we discuss ourformulation without pure spinor constraints. In order to illustrate the ideason which our work is based, we apply them to pure Yang-Mills theory. In theappendices, we include some background material for the Green-Schwarz andBerkovits formulations, in order that this presentation be self contained.
