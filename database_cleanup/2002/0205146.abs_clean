We study a minimally coupled tachyon field rolling down to its ground stateon the FRW brane. We construct tacyonic potential which can implements powerlaw inflation in the brane world cosmology. The potential turns out to be ${V_0\phi^{-1}}$ on the brane and reduces to inverse square potential at late timeswhen brane corrections to the Friedmann equation become negligible. We also dosimilar exercise with a normal scalar field and discover that the inversesquare potential on the brane leads to power law inflation.
