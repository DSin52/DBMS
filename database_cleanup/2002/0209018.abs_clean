Title: Non-singular solutions of flux branes in M-theory and attractor

solutionsComments: Latex, 15 pages

Here we present a class of solutions of M-theory flux branes, which arenon-singular at origin. These class of solutions help us to determine the fieldstrength at origin together with the behavior of it near origin. Further weshow a way to find the attractor solutions of such flux branes.
