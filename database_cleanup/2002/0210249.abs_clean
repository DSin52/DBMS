In this PhD thesis the low energy effective actions for D-branes and theM5-brane are used to analyze the dynamics of brane probes moving in thegeometry created by diverse supergravity backgrounds. It begins with anintroduction to string theory. Brane effective actions with local kappasymmetry are also reviewed. We then study the embedding of D(8-p)-branes in thebackground geometry of parallel Dp-branes. A BPS condition is found and theanalytical solutions describe embeddings which represent branes joined bytubes, which are bundles of fundamental strings. We continue with the analysisof branes partially wrapped on spheres in the near-horizon geometry of branesand bound states. There is a finite number of static configurations as aconsequence of a quantization rule for the worldvolume gauge field. Theseconfigurations can be interpretated as bound states and this is checkeddirectly in a particular case by using the Myers polarization mechanism.Finally we find configurations of brane probes which behave as masslessparticles in the geometry of non-threshold bound states. They can beinterpreted as gravitons blown up into a fuzzy sphere and sharing somedirections with the background.
