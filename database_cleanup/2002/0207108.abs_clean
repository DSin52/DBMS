Title: Exact Answers to Approximate Questions

Wilson Lines, and UV-IR DualityAuthors: Soo-Jong Rey

Comments: short lecture at 2001 Les Houches summer school

In this lecture, I put forward conjectures asserting that, in allnoncommutative field theories, (1) open Wilson lines and their descendantsconstitute a complete set of interpolating operators of `noncommutativedipoles', obeying dipole relation, (2) infrared dynamics of the noncommutativedipoles is dual to ultraviolet dynamics of the elementary noncommutativefields, and (3) open string field theory is a sort of noncommutative fieldtheory, whose open Wilson lines are interpolating operators for closed strings.I substantiate these conjectures by various intuitive arguments and explicitcomputations of one- and two-loop Feynman diagrammatics.
