We calculate the linearized metric perturbations in the five dimensionaltwo-brane model of Randall and Sundrum. In a carefully chosen gauge, we writedown and decouple Einstein equations for the perturbations and get the finaland simple perturbative metric ansatz. This ansatz turns out to be equal to thelinear expansion of the metric solution of Charmousis et al. \cite{rubakov}. Weshow that this ansatz, the metric ansatz of Boos et al. \cite{boos} and the oneof Das and Mitov \cite{das} are not incompatible, as it appears on the surface,but completely equivalent by an allowed gauge transformation that we give.
