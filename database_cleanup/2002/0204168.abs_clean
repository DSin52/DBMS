We consider string theory in a time dependent orbifold with a nullsingularity. The singularity separates a contracting universe from an expandinguniverse, thus constituting a big crunch followed by a big bang. We quantizethe theory both in light-cone gauge and covariantly. We also compute some treeand one loop amplitudes which exhibit interesting behavior near thesingularity. Our results are compatible with the possibility that strings canpass through the singularity from the contracting to the expanding universe,but they also indicate the need for further study of certain divergentscattering amplitudes.
