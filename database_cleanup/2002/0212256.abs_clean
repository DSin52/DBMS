It is shown in detail that the dynamics of the Einstein-dilaton-p-form systemin the vicinity of a spacelike singularity can be asymptotically described, ata generic spatial point, as a billiard motion in a region of Lobachevskii space(realized as an hyperboloid in the space of logarithmic scale factors). This isdone within the Hamiltonian formalism, and for an arbitrary number of spacetimedimensions $D \geq 4$. A key role in the derivation is played by the Iwasawadecomposition of the spatial metric, and by the fact that the off-diagonaldegrees of freedom, as well as the p-form degrees of freedom, get``asymptotically frozen'' in this description. For those models admitting aKac-Moody theoretic interpretation of the billiard dynamics we outline how toset up an asymptotically equivalent description in terms of a one-dimensionalnon-linear sigma-model formally invariant under the corresponding Kac-Moodygroup.
