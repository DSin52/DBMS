Conventional superstring amplitudes in flat space exhibits exponential falloff at wide angle in contrast to the power law behavior found in QCD. It hasrecently been argued by Polchinski and Strassler that this conflict can beresolved via String/Gauge duality. They carried out their analysis in terms ofstrings in a deformed $AdS^5$ background. On the other hand, an equally validapproach to the String/Gauge duality for 4-d QCD is based on M-theory in aspecific Black Hole deformation of $AdS^7 \times S^4$. We show that a verynatural extension to this phenomenologically interesting M-theory backgroundalso gives the correct hard scattering power laws. In the Regge limit we extendthe analysis to show the co-existence of both the hard BFKL-like Pomeron andthe soft Pomeron Regge pole.
