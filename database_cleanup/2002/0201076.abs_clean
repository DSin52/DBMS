We give a constructive classification of the positive energy (lowest weight)unitary irreducible representations of the D=6 superconformal algebrasosp(8*/2N). Our results confirm all but one of the conjectures of Minwalla (forN=1,2) on this classification. Our main tool is the explicit construction ofthe norms of the states that has to be checked for positivity. We give also thereduction of the exceptional UIRs.
