We obtain the magnetic counterpart of the BTZ solution, i.e., the rotatingspacetime of a point source generating a magnetic field in three dimensionalEinstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant. The static(non-rotating) magnetic solution was found by Clement, by Hirschmann and Welchand by Cataldo and Salgado. This paper is an extension of their work in orderto include (i) angular momentum, (ii) the definition of conserved quantities(this is possible since spacetime is asymptotically anti-de Sitter), (iii)upper bounds for the conserved quantities themselves, and (iv) a newinterpretation for the magnetic field source. We show that both the static androtating magnetic solutions have negative mass and that there is an upper boundfor the intensity of the magnetic field source and for the value of the angularmomentum. The magnetic field source can be interpreted not as a vortex but asbeing composed by a system of two symmetric and superposed electric charges,one of the electric charges is at rest and the other is spinning. The rotatingmagnetic solution reduces to the rotating uncharged BTZ solution when themagnetic field source vanishes.
