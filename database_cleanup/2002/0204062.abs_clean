The TST-dual of the general 1/4-supersymmetric D2-brane supertube istransverse displacement travelling at the speed of light. A simple proof isgiven of the classical upper bound on the angular momentum, which is alsorecovered as the semi-classical limit of a quantum bound. The classical boundis saturated by a `superhelix', while the quantum bound is saturated by abosonic oscillator state in a unique SO(8) representation.
