The monodromy matrix, ${\hat{\cal M}}$, is constructed for two dimensionaltree level string effective action. The pole structure of ${\hat{\cal M}}$ isderived using its factorizability property. It is found that the monodromymatrix transforms non-trivially under the non-compact T-duality group, whichleaves the effective action invariant and this can be used to construct themonodromy matrix for more complicated backgrounds starting from simpler ones.We construct, explicitly, ${\hat{\cal M}}$ for the exactly solvableNappi-Witten model, both when B=0 and $B\neq 0$, where these ideas can bedirectly checked. We consider well known charged black hole solutions in theheterotic string theory which can be generated by T-duality transformationsfrom a spherically symmetric `seed' Schwarzschild solution. We construct themonodromy matrix for the Schwarzschild black hole background of the heteroticstring theory.
