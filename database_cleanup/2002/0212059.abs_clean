Closed string tachyon condensation resolves the singularities ofnonsupersymmetric orbifolds, however the resolved space typically has fewerD-brane charges than that of the orbifold. The description of the tachyoncondensation process via a gauged linear sigma model enables one to track thetopology as one passes from the sigma model's ``orbifold phase'' to itsresolved, ``geometric phase,'' and thus to follow how the D-brane chargesdisappear from the effective spacetime dynamics. As a mathematical consequence,our results point the way to a formulation of a ``quantum McKaycorrespondence'' for the resolution of toric orbifold singularities.
