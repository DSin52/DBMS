Title: Rotating D-branes and O-planes

Comments: Contribution to the Proceedings of the first SP2002 Conference and of

the 35 Internationsl Symposium AhrenshoopWe review orientifold constructions in the presence of magnetic backgroundsboth in the open and closed sectors. Generically, the resulting orientifoldmodels have a nice geometric description in terms of rotated D-branes and/orO-planes. In the case of multiple magnetic backgrounds, some amount ofsupersymmetry is recovered if the magnetic fields are suitably chosen and partof the original D-branes and/or O-planes are transmuted into new ones.
