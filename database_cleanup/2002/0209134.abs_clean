It is well known that the building blocks for state sum models of quantumgravity are given by 6j and 10j symbols. In this work we study the asymptoticsof these symbols by using their expressions as group integrals. We carefullydescribe the measure involved in terms of invariant variables and develop newtechnics in order to study their asymptotics. Using these technics we computethe asymptotics of the various Euclidean and Lorentzian 6j-symbols. Finally wecompute the asymptotic expansion of the 10j symbol which is shown to benon-oscillating in agreement with a recent result of Baez et al. We discuss thephysical origin of this behavior and a way to modify the Barrett-Crane model inorder to cure this disease.
