We construct lattices with alternating kinks and anti-kinks. The lattice isshown to be stable in certain models. We consider the forces between kinks andantikinks and find that the lattice dynamics is that of a Toda lattice. Suchlattices are exotic metastable states in which the system can get trappedduring a phase transition.
