Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX, in Proceedings of XVI Max Born Symposium

``Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries'' (SQS01), Karpacz, Poland,September 21-25, 2001. Dubna 2002 pp. 11-17The method of construction of Fock space realizations of Lie algebras isgeneralized for nonlinear algebras. We consider as an example the nonlinearalgebra of constraints which describe the totally symmetric fields with higherspins in the AdS space-time.
