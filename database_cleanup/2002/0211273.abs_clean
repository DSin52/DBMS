Solvable and Integrable SystemsThe $n$ integrals in involution for the motion on the $n$-dimensionalellipsoid under the influence of a harmonic force are explicitly found. Theclassical separation of variables is given by the inverse momentum map. In thequantum case the Schr\"odinger equation separates into one-dimensionalequations that coincide with those obtained from the classical separation ofvariables. We show that there is a more general orthogonal parametrisation ofJacobi type that depends on two arbitrary real parameters. Also if there is acertain relation between the spring constants and the ellipsoid semiaxes themotion under the influence of such a harmonic potential is equivalent to thefree motion on the ellipsoid.
