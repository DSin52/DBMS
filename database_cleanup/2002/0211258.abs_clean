We formulate the $O(3) \s-$ model on fuzzy sphere and construct the Hopfterm. We show that the field can be expanded in terms of the ladder operatorsof Holstein-Primakoff realisation of SU(2) algebra and the corresponding basisset can be classified into different topological sectors by the magneticquantum numbers. We obtain topological charge $Q$ and show that $-2j\le Q\le2j$. We also construct BPS solitons. Using the covariantly conservedcurrent, we construct the Hopf term and show that its value is $Q^2$ as in thecommutative case. We also point out the interesting relation of physical spaceto deformed SU(2) algebra.
