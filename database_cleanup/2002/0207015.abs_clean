Recently the construction of the non-abelian effective D-brane action wasperformed through order $\alpha'{}^3$ including the terms quadratic in thegauginos. This result can be tested by calculating the spectrum in the presenceof constant magnetic background fields and comparing it to the string theoreticpredictions. This test was already performed for the purely bosonic terms. Inthis note we extend the test to the fermionic terms. We obtain perfectagreement.
