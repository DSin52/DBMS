Title: Incompressible Quantum Hall Fluid

Authors: Bo-Yu Hou, Dan-Tao Peng

Comments: 13 pages, no figures, plain latex. Talk given by Bo-Yu Hou at the

International conference of the String theory, Beijing, August 17-19, 2002After review the quantum Hall effect on the fuzzy two-sphere $S^2$ and Zhangand Hu's 4-sphere $S^4$, the incompressible quantum Hall fluid on $S^2$, $S^4$and torus are discussed respectively. Next, the corresponding Laughlinwavefunctions on $S^2$ are also given out. The ADHM construction on $S^4$ isdiscussed. We also point out that on torus, the incompressible quantum Hallfluid is related to the integrable Gaudin model and the solution can be givenout by the Yang Bethe ansatz.
