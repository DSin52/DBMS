We investigate the problem of mapping, through the Morita equivalence, odddimensional noncommutative lattice gauge theories onto suitable matrix models.We specialize our analysis to noncommutative three dimensional QED (NCQED) andscalar QED (NCSQED), for which we explicitly build the corresponding MatrixModel.
