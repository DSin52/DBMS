In this paper we calculate three-string interaction from light cone stringfield theory in pp-wave. We find exact agreements with the free planar threepoint functions of non-chiral BMN operators of ${\cal N} = 4$ super Yang Mills.The three string interaction vertex involving the Neumann matrices was derivedin a recent paper hep-th/0204146. We explicitly calculate the bosonic Neumannmatrices in the limit of large $\mu p^{+} \alpha^{'}$ . Using the Neumannmatrices we are able to compute the cubic interactions of three string modes ina pp-wave background.
