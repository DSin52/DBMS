GeometryWe synthesize and extend the previous ideas about appearance of bothnoncommutative and Finsler geometry in string theory with nonvanishing B--fieldand/or anholonomic (super) frame structures \cite{vstring,vstr2,vnonc,vncf}.There are investigated the limits to the Einstein gravity and stringgeneralizations containing locally anisotropic structures modeled by movingframes. The relation of anholonomic frames and nonlinear connection geometry toM--theory and possible noncommutative versions of locally anisotropicsupergravity and D--brane physics is discussed. We construct and analyze newclasses of exact solutions with noncommutative local anisotropy describinganholonomically deformed black holes (black ellipsoids) in string gravity,embedded Finsler--string two dimensional structures, solitonically moving blackholes in extra dimensions and wormholes with noncommutativity and anisotropyinduced from string theory.
