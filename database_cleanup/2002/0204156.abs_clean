New gaugings of four dimensional N=8 supergravity are constructed, includingone which has a Minkowski space vacuum that preserves N=2 supersymmetry and inwhich the gauge group is broken to $SU(3)xU(1)^2$. Previous gaugings used theform of the ungauged action which is invariant under a rigid $SL(8,R)$ symmetryand promoted a 28-dimensional subgroup ($SO(8),SO(p,8-p)$ or thenon-semi-simple contraction $CSO(p,q,8-p-q)$) to a local gauge group. Here, adual form of the ungauged action is used which is invariant under $SU^*(8)$instead of $SL(8,R)$ and new theories are obtained by gauging 28-dimensionalsubgroups of $SU^*(8)$. The gauge groups are non-semi-simple and are differentreal forms of the $CSO(2p,8-2p)$ groups, denoted $CSO^*(2p,8-2p)$, and the newtheories have a rigid SU(2) symmetry. The five dimensional gauged N=8supergravities are dimensionally reduced to D=4. The $D=5,SO(p,6-p)$ gaugetheories reduce, after a duality transformation, to the $D=4,CSO(p,6-p,2)$gauging while the $SO^*(6)$ gauge theory reduces to the $D=4, CSO^*(6,2)$ gaugetheory. The new theories are related to the old ones via an analyticcontinuation. The non-semi-simple gaugings can be dualised to forms withdifferent gauge groups.
