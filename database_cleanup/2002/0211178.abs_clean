The explicit (all-order in fermions) form of the kappa-symmetric $D3$ braneprobe action was previously found in the two maximally supersymmetric type IIBplane wave supported by constant null 5-form strength. We study $D3$ braneaction in both covariant and light cone kappa symmetry gauges. Like thefundamental string action, the $D3$ brane action takes a simple form oncewritten in the light cone kappa-symmetry gauge. We also consider the $\cN=4$SYM theory in 4d plane wave background. Since some (super)symmetries of planewave SYM action are friendly to (super)symmetries of the type IIB superstringin plane wave Ramond-Ramond background we suggest this SYM model may be usefulin the context of AdS/CFT duality. We develop the Hamiltonian light cone gaugeformulation for this theory.
