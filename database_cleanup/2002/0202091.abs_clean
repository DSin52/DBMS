Negative energy objects generally lead to instabilities and a number of otherdisturbing behaviors. In particular, negative energy fluxes lead to a breakdownof the classical area theorem for black hole horizons, which can lead toviolations of the second law of thermodynamics. The negative energy objectsthat arise in string theory involve special boundary conditions which removethe perturbative instabilities. We show that they have additional specialfeatures which allow them to evade contradiction with the second law. Weidentify one mechanism which applies for most orientifold planes in stringtheory, and distinct mechanisms for the O8-plane and the AdS soliton.
