updated with taking into account of few fresh references which has been addedto the reference list; no new results. To appear in Theor. Math. PhysIntegral transformations of the QCD invariant (running) coupling and of somerelated objects are discussed. Special attention is paid to the Fouriertransformation, that is to transition from the space-time to theenergy--momentum representation.The conclusion is that the condition of possibility of such a transitionprovides us with one more argument against the real existence of unphysicalsingularities observed in the perturbative QCD.The second conclusion relates to the way of "translation" of some singularlong--range asymptotic behaviors to the infrared momentum region. Such atransition has to be performed with the due account of the Tauberian theorem.This comment relates to the recent ALPHA collaboration results on theasymptotic behavior of the QCD effective coupling obtained by latticesimulation.
