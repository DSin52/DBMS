We discuss the different possibilities of constructing the variousenergy-momentum tensors for noncommutative gauge field models. We use Jackiw'smethod in order to get symmetric and gauge invariant stress tensors--at leastfor commutative gauge field theories. The noncommutative counterparts areanalyzed with the same methods. The issues for the noncommutative cases areworked out.
