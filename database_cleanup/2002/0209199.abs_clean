An attempt to get a non-trivial-mass structure of particles in aRandall-Sundrum type of 5-dimensional spacetime with q-deformed extra dimensionis discussed. In this spacetime, the fifth dimensional space is boundary free,but there areises an elastic potential preventing free motion toward the fifthdirection. The q-deformation is, then, introduced in such a way that thespacetime coordinates become non-commutative between 4-dimensional componentsand the fifth component. As a result of this q-deformation, there arisesnaturally an ultraviolet-cutoff effect for the propagators of particlesembedded in this spacetime.
