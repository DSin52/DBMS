We consider quantum p-form fields interacting with a background dilaton. Wecalculate the variation with respect to the dilaton of a difference of theeffective actions in the models related by a duality transformation. We showthat this variation is defined essentially by the supertrace of the twisted deRham complex. The supertrace is then evaluated on a manifold of an arbitrarydimension, with or without boundary.
