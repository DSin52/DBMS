It is shown that in a quantized space determined by the $B_2\quad(O(5)=Sp(4))$ algebra with three dimensional parameters of the length $L^2$,momentum $(Mc)^2$, and action $S$, the spectrum of the Coulomb problem withconserving Runge-Lenz vector coincides with the spectrum found by Schr\"odingerfor the space of constant curvature but with the values of the principalquantum number limited from the side of higher values. The same problem issolved for the spectrum of a harmonic oscillator.
