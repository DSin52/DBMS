We construct open cosmic string solutions in Schwarzschild black hole andnon-dilatonic black p-brane backgrounds. These strings can be thought tostretch between two D-branes or between a D-brane and the horizon in curvedspace-time. We study small fluctuations around these solutions and discusstheir basic properties.
