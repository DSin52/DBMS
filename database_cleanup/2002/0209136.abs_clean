Title: Abelian two-form gauge theory

Comments: LaTeX, 23 pages, version to appear in J. Phys. A

It is shown that the four $(3 + 1)$-dimensional (4D) free Abelian 2-formgauge theory provides an example of (i) a class of field theoretical models forthe Hodge theory, and (ii) a possible candidate for the quasi-topological fieldtheory (q-TFT). Despite many striking similarities with some of the keytopological features of the two $(1 + 1)$-dimensional (2D) free Abelian (andself-interacting non-Abelian) gauge theories, it turns out that the 4D freeAbelian 2-form gauge theory is {\it not} an exact TFT. To corroborate thisconclusion, some of the key issues are discussed. In particular, it is shownthat the (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST invariant quantities of the 4D 2-formAbelian gauge theory obey the recursion relations that are reminiscent of theexact TFTs but the Lagrangian density of this theory is not found to be able tobe expressed as the sum of (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST exact quantities asis the case with the {\it topological} 2D free Abelian (and self-interactingnon-Abelian) gauge theories.
