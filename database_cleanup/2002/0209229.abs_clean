Title: Supersymmetry in Quantum Theory Over a Galois Field

Authors: Felix Lev

Comments: 35 pages, Latex, no figures

As shown in our previous papers (hep-th/0209001 and reference therein),quantum theory based on a Galois field (GFQT) possesses a new symmetry betweenparticles and antiparticles, which has no analog in the standard approach. Inthe present paper it is shown that this symmetry (called the AB one) is alsocompatible with supersymmetry. We believe this is a strong argument in favor ofour assumption that the AB symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in the GFQT (andin nature if it is described by quantum theory over a Galois field). We alsoconsider operatorial formulations of space inversion and X inversion in theGFQT. It is shown in particular that the well known fact, that the parity ofbosons is real and the parity of fermions is imaginary, is a simple consequenceof the AB symmetry.
