In three dimensions, a `master theory' for all Thurston geometries requiresimaginary flux. However, these geometries can be obtained from physicalthree-dimensional theories with various additional scalar fields, which can beinterpreted as moduli in various compactifications of a higher-dimensional`master theory'. Three Thurston geometries are of the form N_2 x S^1, where N_2denotes a two-dimensional Riemannian space of constant curvature. This enablesus to twist these spaces, via T-duality, into other Thurston geometries as aU(1) bundle over N_2. In this way, Hopf T-duality relates all but one of thegeometries in the higher-dimensional M-theoretic framework. The exception isthe `Sol geometry,' which results from the dimensional reduction of thedecoupling limit of the D3-brane in a background B-field.
