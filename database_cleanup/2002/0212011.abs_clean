The multi-centre metrics are a family of euclidean solutions of the emptyspace Einstein equations with self-dual curvature. For this full class, wedetermine which metrics do exhibit an extra conserved quantity quadraic in themomenta, induced by a Killing-Stackel tensor. Our results bring to lightseveral metrics which correspond to classically integrable dynamical systems.They include, as particular cases, the Eguchi-Hanson and Taub-NUT metrics.
