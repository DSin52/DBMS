Title: Wave function of the radion with BPS branes

Authors: G. Cynolter

Comments: 15 pages, changed references and discussion of the literature

We investigate coupled gravity and a bulk scalar field on a slice of AdS_5bulk with special BPS branes at the two ends. With the special scalarpotentials on the branes the scalar field does not stabilize the size of theorbifold. With a careful treatment of the general coordinate invariance thecomplete tensor-scalar spectrum is presented. There are two massless zero modesin the scalar sector, the radion and a dilatonic zero mode. The scalar KK modesacquire masses at the order of the warped mass scale. The four dimensionaleffective action is of tensor-scalar type.
