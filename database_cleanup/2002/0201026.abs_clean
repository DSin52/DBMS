We investigate the ABJ anomaly in the framework of an effective field theoryfor a 3-brane scenario and show that the contribution from induced gravity onthe brane depends on both the topological structure of the bulk space-time andthe embedding of the brane in the bulk. This fact implies the existence of anon-trivial vacuum structure of bulk quantum gravity. Furthermore, we arguethat this axial gravitational anomaly may not necessarily be cancelled bychoosing the matter content on the brane since it could be considered as apossible effect from bulk quantum gravity.
