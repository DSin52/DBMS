Title: The complex sine-Gordon model on a half line

Authors: P.Bowcock, G.Tzamtzis

Comments: 32 pages, latex, 5 figures

In this paper, we examine the complex sine-Gordon model in the presence of aboundary, and derive boundary conditions that preserve integrability. Wepresent soliton and breather solutions, investigate the scattering of particlesand solitons off the boundary and examine the existence of classical solutionscorresponding to boundary bound states.
