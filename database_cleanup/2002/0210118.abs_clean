Title: Holography and (1+1)-dimension non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics

Comments: 4 pages, no fig, use revtex4.cls

I generalize classical gravity/quantum gauge theory duality in AdS/CFTcorrespondence to (1+1)-dimensional non-relativistic quantum mechanical system.It is shown that (1+1)-dimensional non-relativistic quantum mechanical systemcan be reproduced from holographic projection of (2+1)-dimension classicalgravity at semiclassical limit. In this explanation every quantum path in2-dimension corresponds to a classical path of 3-dimension gravity underdefinite holographic projection. I consider free particle and harmonicoscillator as two examples and find their dual gravity description.
