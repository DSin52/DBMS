We derive the second variation Lagrangian of the Randall-Sundrum model withtwo branes, study its gauge invariance and diagonalize it in the unitary gauge.We also show that the effective four-dimensional theory looks different ondifferent branes and calculate the observable mass spectra and the couplings ofthe physical degrees of freedom of 5-dimensional gravity to matter.
