Title: Acceleration of the Universe in Type-0 Non-Critical Strings

Comments: 10 pages LATEX, 3 eps figures incorporated, Proceedings of Corfu 2001

Workshop on high energy physics, Corfu (Greece), September 2001I review cosmology within the framework of type-0 non-critical strings,proposed in collaboration with G. Diamandis, B. Georgalas, E. Papantonopoulosand I. Pappa. The instabilities of the tachyonic backgrounds, due to theabsence of space-time supersymmetry, are treated in this framework as anecessary ingredient to ensure cosmological flow. The model involves D3 braneworlds, whose initial quantum fluctuations induce the non criticality. I arguethat this model is compatible with the current astrophysical observationspointing towards acceleration of the Universe. A crucial r\^ole for the correct``phenomenology'' of the model, in particular the order-one value of thedeceleration parameter, is played by the relative magnitude of the flux of thefive form of the type-0 string as compared to the size of the volume of five ofthe extra dimensions, transverse to the direction of the flux-field.
