We extend the method of matrix partition to obtain explicitly the gauge fieldfor noncommutative ADHM construction in some general cases. As an applicationof this method we apply it to the U(2) 2-instanton and get explicit result forthe gauge fields in the coincident instanton limit. We also easily apply it tothe noncommutative 't Hooft instantons in the appendix.
