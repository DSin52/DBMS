We consider giant gravitons as probes of a class of ten-dimensional solutionsof type IIB supergravity which arise as lifts of solutions of U(1)^3 gauged N=2supergravity in five-dimensions. Surprisingly it is possible to solve exactlyfor minimum energy configurations of these spherical D3-brane probes in thecompact directions, even in backgrounds which preserve no supersymmetry. Thebranes behave as massive charged particles in the five non-compact dimensions.As an example we probe geometries which are believed to represent thesupergravity background of coherent states of giant gravitons. We comment onthe apparently repulsive nature of the naked singularities in these geometries.
