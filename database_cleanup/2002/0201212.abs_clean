A model of spherically symmetric SU(2) gauge theory is considered. Theself-duality equations are written and it is shown that they are compatiblewith the Einstein-Yang-Mills equations. It is proven that this property is truefor any gauge theory with curved base space-time and having a compact Lie groupas structural group.
