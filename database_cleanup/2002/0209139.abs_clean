added,typos fixedWe show that the integral of the first Pontrjagin class is given by aninteger and it is identified with instanton number of the U(n) gauge theory onnoncommutative ${\bf R^4}$. Here the dimension of the vector space $V$ thatappear in the ADHM construction is called Instanton number. The calculation isdone in operator formalism and the first Pontrjagin class is defined byconverge series. The origin of the instanton number is investigated closely,too.
