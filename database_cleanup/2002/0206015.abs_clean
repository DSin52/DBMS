The bound state spectrum of the massive Thirring model is studied in theframework of the canonical quantization in the rest frame. First, we quantizethe field with the massless free fermion basis states. Then, we make aBogoliubov transformation. This leads to the natural mass renormalization. Thebound state spectrum is analytically solved by the $q\bar{q}$ Fock space. It isfound that the spectrum has the right behaviors both for the weak and for thestrong coupling limits after the appropriate wave function regularization. Thisregularization is quite clear and the treatment is self-consistent for thebound state problem compared to other regularizations. Further, we show thatthe interaction between $q\bar{q}$ bosons is always repulsive and thereforethere is no bound state in the four fermion ($qq \bar q \bar q$) Fock space.This confirms that there is only one bound state in the massive Thirring model.
