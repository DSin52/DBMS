We continue the study of supersymmetric type IIB pp wave solutions byMaldacena and Maoz (hep-th/0207284), who showed Ramond-Ramond five-forms caninduce potential terms in the light cone string actions which are nonlinearsigma models with special holonomy target spaces. We show nonvanishingRamond-Ramond three-forms provide extra potential terms involving Killingvectors in the string action and identify the supersymmetry requirements. Inparticular, in solutions with (1,1) worldsheet supersymmetry, the Killingvectors are required to be self-dual in Spin(7).
