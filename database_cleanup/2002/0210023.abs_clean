and will be stated separately elsewhereBy critical analyses of the order parameter of symmetry breaking, we haveresearched the phase transitions at high density in D=2 and D=3 Gross-Neveu(GN) model and shown that the gap equation obeyed by the dynamical fermion masshas the same effectivenesss as the effective potentials for such analyses ofall the second order and some special first order phase transitions. In themeantime we also further ironed out a theoretical divergence and proven that inD=3 GN model a first order phase transition does occur in the case of zerotemperature and finite chemical potential.
