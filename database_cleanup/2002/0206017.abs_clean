We provide a proof of the equivalence of N=1 dynamics obtained by deformingN=2 supersymmetric gauge theories by addition of certain superpotential terms,with that of type IIB superstring on Calabi-Yau threefold geometries withfluxes. In particular we show that minimization of the superpotential involvinggaugino fields is equivalent to finding loci where Seiberg-Witten curve hascertain factorization property. Moreover, by considering the limit of turningoff of the superpotential we obtain the full low energy dynamics of N=2 gaugesystems from Calabi-Yau geometries with fluxes.
