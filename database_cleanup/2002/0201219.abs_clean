We study asymptotic distribution of eigen-values $\omega$ of a quadraticoperator polynomial of the following form $(\omega^2-L(\omega))\phi_\omega=0$,where $L(\omega)$ is a second order differential positive elliptic operatorwith quadratic dependence on the spectral parameter $\omega$. We deriveasymptotics of the spectral density in this problem and show how to computecoefficients of its asymptotic expansion from coefficients of the asymptoticexpansion of the trace of the heat kernel of $L(\omega)$. The leading term inthe spectral asymptotics is the same as for a Laplacian in a cavity. Theresults have a number of physical applications. We illustrate them by examplesof field equations in external stationary gravitational and gauge backgrounds.
