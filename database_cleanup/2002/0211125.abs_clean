It is shown that non-commutative spaces, which are quotients of associativealgebras by ideals generated by non-linear relations of a particular type,admit extremely simple formulae for deformed or star products. Explicitconstruction of these star products is carried out. Quantum gauge theories areformulated on these spaces, and the Seiberg-Witten map is worked out in detail.
