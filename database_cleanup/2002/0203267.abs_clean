Looking for string vacua with fixed moduli, we study compactifications oftype IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau fourfolds in the presence of genericRamond-Ramond fields. We explicitly derive the (super)potential induced byRamond-Ramond fluxes performing a Kaluza-Klein reduction of the ten-dimensionaleffective action. This can be conveniently achieved in a formulation of themassive type IIA supergravity where all Ramond-Ramond fields appear in ademocratic way. The result agrees with the general formula for thesuperpotential written in terms of calibrations. We further notice that forgeneric Ramond-Ramond fluxes all geometric moduli are stabilized and one findsnon-supersymmetric vacua at positive values of the scalar potential.
