The B_N hyperbolic Sutherland spin model is expressed in terms of a suitableset of commuting Dunkl operators. This fact is exploited to derive a completefamily of commuting integrals of motion of the model, thus establishing itsintegrability. The Dunkl operators are shown to possess a common flag ofinvariant finite-dimensional linear spaces of smooth scalar functions. Thisimplies that the Hamiltonian of the model preserves a corresponding flag ofsmooth spin functions. The discrete spectrum of the restriction of theHamiltonian to this spin flag is explicitly computed by triangularization. Theintegrability of the hyperbolic Sutherland spin chain of B_N type associatedwith the dynamical model is proved using Polychronakos's "freezing trick".
