Two pictures of BPS bound states in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIstring theory exist, one as a set of particles at equilibrium separations fromeach other, the other as a fusion of D-branes at a single point of space. Weshow how quiver quantum mechanics smoothly interpolates between the two, anduse this, together with recent mathematical results on the cohomology of quivervarieties, to solve some nontrivial ground state counting problems inmulti-particle quantum mechanics, including one arising in the setup of thespherical quantum Hall effect, and to count ground state degeneracies ofcertain dyons in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. A crucial ingredient is anon-renormalization theorem in N=4 quantum mechanics for the first order partof the Lagrangian in an expansion in powers of velocity.
