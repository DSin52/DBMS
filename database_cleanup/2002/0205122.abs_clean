We discuss magnetic monopoles in gauge theories with Wilson loops onorbifolds. We present a simple example in 5 dimensions with the fifth dimensioncompactified on an S^1/Z_2 orbifold. The Wilson loop in this SO(3) examplereplaces the adjoint Higgs scalar (needed to break SO(3) to U(1)) in thewell-known 't Hooft - Polyakov construction. Our solution is a magneticmonopole string with finite energy, and length equal to the size of the extradimension.
