I construct 1/16, 1/8 and 1/4 BPS Wilson loops in N=4 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory and argue that expectation values of 1/4 BPS loops do notreceive quantum corrections. At strong coupling, non-renormalization ofsupersymmetric Wilson loops implies subtle cancellations in the partitionfunction of the AdS string with special boundary conditions. The cancellationsare shown to occur in the semiclassical approximation.
