Coupling fundamental quarks to QCD in the dual string representationcorresponds to adding the open string sector. Flavors therefore should berepresented by space-time filling D-branes in the dual 5d closed stringbackground. This requires several interesting properties of D-branes in AdS.D-branes have to be able to end in thin air in order to account for massivequarks, which only live in the UV region. They must come in distinct sets,representing the chiral global symmetry, with a bifundamental field playing therole of the chiral condensate. We show that these expectations are born out inseveral supersymmetric examples. To analyze most of these properties it is notnecessary to go beyond the probe limit in which one neglects the backreactionof the flavor D-branes.
