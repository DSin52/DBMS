Higher order renormalization in 4D quantum gravity is carried out usingdimensional regularization with great care concerning the conformal-modedependence. In this regularization, resummation can be automatically carriedout without making an assumption like that of David, Distler and Kawai. In thispaper we consider a model of 4D quantum gravity coupled to QED. Resummationinevitably implies a four-derivative quantum gravity. The renormalizability isdirectly checked up to $O(e_r^6)$ and $O(t_r^2)$, where $e_r$ and $t_r$ are therunning coupling constants of QED and the traceless gravitational mode. Thereis no other running coupling constant in our model. The conformal mode istreated exactly, which means it is unrenormalized. It is found that Hathrell'sresults are included in our results. As a by-product, it is found that ahigher-order gravitational correction to the beta function of QED is negative.An advantage of our model is that in the very high-energy regime, it closelyresembles exactly solvable 2D quantum gravity. Thus, we can study physicalstates of 4D quantum gravity in this regime in parallel to those of 2D quantumgravity, which can be described with diffeomorphism invariant composite fields.
