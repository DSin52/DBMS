We investigate the various time-dependent bubble spacetimes that can beobtained from double analytic continuation of asymptotically locally flat/AdSspacetimes with NUT charge. We find different time-dependent explicit solutionsof general relativity from double analytic continuations of Taub-Nut(-AdS) andKerr-Nut(-AdS) spacetimes. One solution in particular has Milne-like evolutionthroughout, and another is a NUT-charged generalization of the AdS soliton.These solutions are all four dimensional. In certain situations the NUT chargeinduces an ergoregion into the bubble spacetime and in other situations itquantitatively modifies the evolution of the bubble, as when rotation ispresent. In dimensions greater than four, no consistent bubble solutions arefound that have only one timelike direction.
