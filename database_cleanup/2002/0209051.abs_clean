We describe new numerical methods to solve the static axisymmetric vacuumEinstein equations in more than four dimensions. As an illustration, we studythe compactified non-uniform black string phase connected to the uniformstrings at the Gregory-Laflamme critical point. We compute solutions with aratio of maximum to minimum horizon radius up to nine. For a fixedcompactification radius, the mass of these solutions is larger than the mass ofthe classically unstable uniform strings. Thus they cannot be the end state ofthe instability.
