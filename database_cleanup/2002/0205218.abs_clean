We study Witten open string field theory in the pp-wave background in thetensionless limit, and construct the N-string vertex in the basis whichdiagonalizes the string perturbative spectrum. We found that the Witten*-product can be viewed as infinite copies of the Moyal product with the samenoncommutativity parameter $\theta=2$. Moreover, we show that this Moyalstructure is universal in the sense that, written in the string bit basis,Witten's *-product for any background can always be given in terms of theabove-mentioned Moyal structure. We identify some projective operators in thisalgebra that we argue to correspond to D-branes of the theory.
