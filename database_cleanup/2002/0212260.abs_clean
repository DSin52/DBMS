Cosmology. Oxford, United Kingdom. July 2002Commutativity of the diagram of the maps connecting three one--particlestate, implied by the Equivalence Postulate (EP), gives a cocycle conditionwhich unequivocally leads to the quantum Hamilton--Jacobi equation. Energyquantization is a direct consequences of the local homeomorphicity of thetrivializing map. We review the EP and show that the quantum potential for twofree particles, which depends on constants which may have a geometricalinterpretation, plays the role of interaction term that admits solutions whichdo not vanish in the classical limit.
