We compute the non-abelian couplings in the Chern-Simons action for a set ofcoinciding fundamental strings in both the type IIA and type IIB Matrix stringtheories. Starting from Matrix theory in a weakly curved background, weconstruct the linear couplings of closed string fields to type IIA Matrixstrings. Further dualities give a type IIB Matrix string theory and a type IIAtheory of Matrix strings with winding.
