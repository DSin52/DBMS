The notion of Poincare gauge manifold ($G$), proposed in the context of an(1+1) gravitational theory by Cangemi and Jackiw (D. Cangemi and R. Jackiw,Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) 225 (1993) 229), is explored from a geometrical point ofview. First $G$ is defined for arbitrary dimensions, and in the sequence asymplectic structure is attached to $T*G$. Treating the case of fivedimensions, a (4,1)-de Sitter space, aplications are presented studingrepresentations of the Poincare group in association with kinetic theory andthe Weyl operators in phase space. The central extension in theAghassi-Roman-Santilli group (J. J. Aghassi, P. Roman and R. M. Santilli, Phys.Rev. D 1(1970) 2573) is derived as a subgroup of linear transformations in $G$with six dimensions.
