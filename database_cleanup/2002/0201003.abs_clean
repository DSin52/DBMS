The non-abelian Chern-Simons field interacting with $N$ component complexfield is treated as a constrained system using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach.The reduced phase space Hamiltonian density is obtained without introducingLagrange multipliers and with out any additional gauge fixing condition. Thequantization of this system is also discussed.
