We study vortex-like configurations in planar Abelian gauge models thatinclude a Chern-Simons term. In pure Chern-Simons Electrodynamics, forinstance, such objects appear as point-like magnetic vortices. Then, althoughgiving rise to finite flux, they yield divergent magnetic energy. As it iswell-known, such a scenario is deeply changed whenever Higgs mechanism takesplace and local symmetry is spontaneously broken down. Now, soliton-likeconfigurations carry finite energy, as well. On the other hand, even in thesimpler, say, Maxwell-Chern-Simons framework, the dynamical (Maxwell) term isshown to modify the point-like structure of the pure Chern-Simons vortices.Indeed, we have seen that the magnetic field naturally acquires a smoothbehavior (quite similar to the Nielsen-Olensen solution in (3+1) dimensions),providing finite magnetic flux and energy for this sort of vortex. It is alsoidentified a ``magnetic symmetry'' between a point-like charge and anfield. Furthermore, we tackle the case in which a spinless particle interactsnon-minimally with a charge-vortex composite, so that an analogue of theAharonov-Casher effect comes out from our considerations. In our case, such aphase depends upon mass and distance parameters, which naturally suggests us anway for measuring Chern-Simons parameter.
