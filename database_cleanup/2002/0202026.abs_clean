equation for quark-antiquark bound statesAuthors: Jun-Chen Su

Comments: 27 pages,no figures

The interaction kernel in the Bethe-Salpeter equation for quark-antiquarkbound states is derived from the Bethe-Salpeter equations satisfied by thequark-antiquark four-point Green's function. The latter equations areestablished based on the equations of motion obeyed by the quark and antiquarkpropagators, the four-point Green's function and some other kinds of Green'sfunctions which follow directly from the QCD generating functional. The B-Skernel derived is given an exact and explicit expression which contains only afew types of Green's functions. This expression is not only convenient forperturbative calculations, but also suitable for nonperturbativeinvestigations.
