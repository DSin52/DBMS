Starting from a N=1 scalar supermultiplet in 2+1 dimensions, we demonstrateexplicitly the appearance of induced N=1 vector and scalar supermultiplets ofcomposite operators made out of the fundamental supersymmetric constituents. Wediscuss an extension to a N=2 superalgebra with central extension, due to theexistence of topological currents in 2+1 dimensions. As a specific model weconsider a supersymmetric $CP^1$ $\sigma$-model as the constituent theory, anddiscuss the relevance of these results for an effective description of theinfrared dynamics of planar high-temperature superconducting condensed mattermodels with quasiparticle excitations near nodal points of their Fermi surface.
