We show that a kink and a topologically trivial soliton in the Gross-Neveumodel form, in the large-N limit, a marginally stable static configuration,which is bound at threshold. The energy of the resulting composite system doesnot depend on the separation of its solitonic constituents, which serves as amodulus governing the profile of the compound soliton. Thus, in the large-Nlimit, a kink and a non-topological soliton exert no force on each other.
