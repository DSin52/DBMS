Title: Semiclassical Theory for Two-anyon System

Authors: Jin Hur, Choonkyu Lee

The semiclassical quantization conditions for all partial waves are derivedfor bound states of two interacting anyons in the presence of a uniformbackground magnetic field. Singular Aharonov-Bohm-type interactions between theanyons are dealt with by the modified WKB method of Friedrich and Trost. Fors-wave bound state problems in which the choice of the boundary condition atshort distance gives rise to an additional ambiguity, a suitable generalizationof the latter method is required to develop a consistent WKB approach. We hereshow how the related self-adjoint extension parameter affects the semiclassicalquantization condition for energy levels. For some simple cases admitting exactanswers, we verify that our semiclassical formulas in fact provide highlyaccurate results over a broad quantum number range.
