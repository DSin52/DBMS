In this paper, imposing hermitian conjugate relations on the two-parameterdeformed quantum group GL_{p,q}(2) is studied. This results in anon-commutative phase associated with the unitarization of the quantum group.After the achievement of the quantum group U_{p,q}(2) with pq real via anon-commutative phase, the representation of the algebra is built by means ofthe action of the operators constituting the U_{p,q}(2) matrix on states.
