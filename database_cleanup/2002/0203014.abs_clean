In both old and recent literature, it has been argued that the celebrated vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity of massive gravity is an artifact dueto linearization of the true equations of motion. In this letter, weinvestigate that claim. First, we exhibit an explicit -albeit somewhatarbitrary- fully covariant set of equations of motion that, upon linearization,reduce to the standard Pauli-Fierz equations. We show that the vDVZdiscontinuity still persists in that non-linear, covariant theory. Then, werestrict our attention to a particular system that consistently incorporatescovariant and does not share the arbitrariness and imperfections of ourprevious covariantization, and its linearization exhibits a vDVZ discontinuity.Nevertheless, we explicitly show that the discontinuity does disappear in thefully covariant theory, and we explain the reason for this phenomenon.
