We study Wilson loops in N=4 SYM theory which are non-constant in the scalar(S5) directions and open string solutions associated with them in the contextof AdS/CFT correspondence. An interplay between Minkowskian and Euclideanpictures turns out to be non-trivial for time-dependent Wilson loops. We findthat in the S5-rotating case there appears to be no direct open-string dualsfor the Minkowskian Wilson loops, and their expectation values should beobtained by analytic continuation from the Euclidean-space results. In theEuclidean case, we determine the dependence of the ``quark - anti-quark''potential on the rotation parameter, both at weak coupling (i.e. in the 1-loopperturbative SYM theory) and at strong coupling (i.e. in the classical stringtheory in AdS5 x S5).
