type I dualAuthors: P. Bain

In this letter, we investigate corrections to quartic gauge couplings incompactifications of string theories on a 2-torus without vector structure.First, we calculate the threshold corrections to F^4 terms in the heterotic CHLstring. Then, using the CHL string/type I duality dictionary, we map thesecorrections to perturbative and non-perturbative effects in type I stringcompactified on 2-torus without vector structure. Comparing the perturbativeterms provides a quantitative test of the S-duality conjecture. Thenon-perturbative contributions are due to D-strings wrapping the torus. AT-duality along one of the compactified directions allows us to compare theseinstanton corrections to the ones obtained in a standard type Icompactifications. The most striking feature is that these non-perturbativecouplings turn out to be identical for both models.
