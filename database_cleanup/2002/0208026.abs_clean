We consider the toroidal black holes that arise as a generalization of theAdS_5 times S^5 solution of type IIB supergravity. The symmetries of thehorizon space allow T-duality transformations that can be exploited to generatenew inequivalent black hole solutions of both type IIB and type IIAsupergravity, with non-trivial dilaton, B-field, and RR forms. We examine theasymptotic structure and thermodynamical properties of these solutions.
