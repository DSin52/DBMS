Title: Absence of higher derivatives in the renormalization of propagators in

quantum field theories with infinitely many couplingsAuthors: Damiano Anselmi

I study some aspects of the renormalization of quantum field theories withinfinitely many couplings. I prove that, in the absence of a cosmologicalconstant and when the space-time manifold admits a metric of constantcurvature, the propagator is not affected by terms with higher derivatives.More generally, certain lagrangian terms are not turned on by renormalization,if they are absent at the tree level. This restricts the form of the action ofa non-renormalizable theory, and has applications to quantum gravity. The newaction contains infinitely many couplings, but not all of the ones that mighthave been expected. In quantum gravity, the metric of constant curvature is anextremal, but not a minimum, of the complete action. Nonetheless, it appears tobe the right perturbative vacuum, at least when the curvature is negative,suggesting that the quantum vacuum has a negative asymptotically constantcurvature. The results of this paper give also a set of rules for a moreeconomical use of effective quantum field theories and suggest that it might bepossible to give mathematical sense to theories with infinitely many couplingsat high energies, to search for physical predictions.
