Title: Solitons in Seiberg-Witten Theory and D-branes in the Derived Category

Authors: Paul S. Aspinwall and Robert L. Karp

We analyze the "geometric engineering" limit of a type II string on asuitable Calabi-Yau threefold to obtain an N=2 pure SU(2) gauge theory. Thederived category picture together with Pi-stability of B-branes beautifullyreproduces the known spectrum of BPS solitons in this case in a very explicitway. Much of the analysis is particularly easy since it can be reduced toquestions about the derived category of CP1.
