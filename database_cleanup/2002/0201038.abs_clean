Title: Knot Theory from the Perspective of Field and String Theory

Authors: Jose M. F. Labastida

Comments: 5 pages, Proceedings of the International Europhysics Conference on

High Energy Physics, Budapest, 12-18 July 2001I present a summary of the recent progress made in field and string theorywhich has led to a reformulation of quantum-group polynomial invariants forknots and links into new polynomial invariants whose coefficients can bedescribed in topological terms. The approach opens a new point of view in thetheory of knot and link invariants.
