gauge removedThe quantization of the non-commutative N=1, U(1) super-Yang-Mills action isperformed in the superfield formalism. We calculate the one-loop corrections tothe self-energy of the vector superfield. Although the power-counting theorempredicts quadratic ultraviolet and infrared divergences, there are actuallyonly logarithmic UV and IR divergences, which is a crucial feature ofnon-commutative supersymmetric field theories.
