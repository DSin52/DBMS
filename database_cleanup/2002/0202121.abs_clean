We analyze the hamiltonian quantization of Chern-Simons theory associated tothe universal covering of the Lorentz group SO(3,1). The algebra of observablesis generated by finite dimensional spin networks drawn on a puncturedtopological surface. Our main result is a construction of a unitaryrepresentation of this algebra. For this purpose, we use the formalism ofcombinatorial quantization of Chern-Simons theory, i.e we quantize the algebraof polynomial functions on the space of flat SL(2,C)-connections on atopological surface with punctures. This algebra admits a unitaryrepresentation acting on an Hilbert space which consists in wave packets ofspin-networks associated to principal unitary representations of the quantumLorentz group. This representation is constructed using only Clebsch-Gordandecomposition of a tensor product of a finite dimensional representation with aprincipal unitary representation. The proof of unitarity of this representationis non trivial and is a consequence of properties of intertwiners which arestudied in depth. We analyze the relationship between the insertion of apuncture colored with a principal representation and the presence of aworld-line of a massive spinning particle in de Sitter space.
