A perturbative quantum theory of the 2-Killing vector reduction of generalrelativity is constructed. Although non-renormalizable in the standard sense,we show that to all orders of the loop expansion strict cut-off independencecan be achieved in a space of Lagrangians differing only by a field dependentconformal factor. In particular the Noether currents and the quantumconstraints can be defined as finite composite operators. The form of the fielddependence in the conformal factor changes with the renormalization scale and aclosed formula is obtained for the beta functional governing its flow. The flowpossesses a unique fixed point at which the trace anomaly is shown to vanish.The approach to the fixed point adheres to Weinberg's ``asymptotic safety''scenario, both in the gravitational wave/cosmological sector and in thestationary sector.
