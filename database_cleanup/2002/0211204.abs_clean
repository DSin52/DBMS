Authors: Jose D. Edelstein

Comments: 9 pages, sc3conf.sty; Invited talk at the 3rd Sakharov International

Conference, Moscow, June 24-29, 2002. To appear in the ProceedingsWe review some aspects of the gravity duals of supersymmetric gauge theories,arising in the world-volume of D-branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles ofspecial holonomy manifolds, within the framework of lower dimensional gaugedsupergravity.
