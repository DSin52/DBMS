Title: A fixed point for truncated quantum Einstein gravity

Comments: 8 pages, Latex

A perturbative quantum theory of the two Killing vector reduction of Einsteingravity is constructed. Although the reduced theory inherits from the full onethe lack of standard perturbative renormalizability, we show that strict cutoffindependence can be regained to all loop orders in a space of Lagrangiansdiffering only by a field dependent conformal factor. A closed formula isobtained for the beta functional governing the flow of this conformal factor.The flow possesses a unique fixed point at which the trace anomaly is shown tovanish. The approach to the fixed point is compatible with Weinberg's``asymptotic safety'' scenario.
