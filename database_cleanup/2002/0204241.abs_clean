Title: Monopoles from Instantons

Authors: Falk Bruckmann

Comments: Talk given at the NATO Advanced Research Workshop "Confinement,

Topology, and other Non-Perturbative Aspects of QCD", January 21-27, 2002,changesThe relation between defects of Abelian gauges and instantons is discussedfor explicit examples in the Laplacian Abelian gauge. The defect coming from aninstanton is pointlike and becomes a monopole loop with twist uponperturbation. The interplay between magnetic charge, twist and instanton numberan auxiliary Abelian fibre bundle.
