October 19 - 21, 2001. Edited by Marc Henneaux and Alexander SevrinThe Euclidean Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry may be considered as anextremum of two different action principles. If the thermodynamical parametersare held fixed at the cosmological horizon, one deals with the gravitationalthermodynamical effects of the black hole but ignores those of the cosmologicalhorizon. Conversely, if the macroscopical variables are held fixed at the blackhole horizon, it is only the cosmological horizon thermodynamics which is dealtwith. Both cases are analyzed. In particular, the internal energy U iscalculated in the semiclassical approximation as a function of the massparameter m of Schwarzschild de Sitter space. In the first case one finds U=+m,while in the second one gets U=-m. This suggests that de Sitter space isthermodynamically unstable under black hole formation.
