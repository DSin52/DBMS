We continue our investigation of the phenomenological implications of the"deformed" commutation relations [x_i,p_j]=i hbar[(1 + beta p^2) delta_{ij} +beta' p_i p_j]. These commutation relations are motivated by the fact that theylead to the minimal length uncertainty relation which appears in perturbativestring theory. In this paper, we consider the effects of the deformation on theclassical orbits of particles in a central force potential. Comparison withobservation places severe constraints on the value of the minimum length.
