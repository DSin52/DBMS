EffectIn this paper we examine fermionic type characters (Universal ChiralPartition Functions) for general 2D conformal field theories with a bilinearform given by a matrix of the form K \oplus K^{-1}. We provide varioustechniques for determining these K-matrices, and apply these to a variety ofexamples including (higher level) WZW and coset conformal field theories.Applications of our results to fractional quantum Hall systems and (levelrestricted) Kostka polynomials are discussed.
