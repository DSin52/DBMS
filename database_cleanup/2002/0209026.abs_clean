We develop an approach based on the Noether method to construct nilpotentBRST charges and BRST-invariant actions. We apply this approach first to theholomorphic part of the flat-space covariant superstring, and we find that theghosts b, c_z which we introduced by hand in our earlier work, are needed tofix gauge symmetries of the ghost action. Then we apply this technique to thesuperparticle and determine its cohomology. Finally, we extend our results tothe combined left- and right-moving sectors of the superstring.
