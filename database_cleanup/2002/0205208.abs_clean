the proceedings of the workshop "Braneworld -- Dynamics of spacetime withboundary --, minor typos correctedFirst, we will study the cosmological perturbations from the brane point ofview. It turns out that two types of the extra data are necessary to know theevolution of the system. To fix these data, the analysis of the bulk is needed.So, we have solved equations of motion for the bulk gravity and determined theextra data. We would like to stress that, both analysis take complementaryroles to achieve this goal.
