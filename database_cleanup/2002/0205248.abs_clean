The symmetry algebra of a QFT in the presence of an external EM background(named "residual symmetry") is investigated within a Lie-algebraic, modelindependent scheme. Some results previously encountered in the literature arehere extended. In particular we compute the symmetry algebra for a constant EMbackground in D=3 and D=4 dimensions. In D= 3 dimensions the residual symmetryalgebra is isomorphic to $u(1)\oplus {\cal P}_c(2)$, with ${\cal P}_c(2)$ thecentrally extended 2-dimensional Poincar\'e algebra. In D=4 dimension thegeneric residual symmetry algebra is given by a seven-dimensional solvable Liealgebra which is explicitly computed. Residual symmetry algebras are alsocomputed for specific non-constant EM backgrounds.
