We present a gauge invariant action for a superstring in the plane wavebackground with Ramond-Ramond (RR) five-form flux. The Wess-Zumino term isgiven explicitly in a bilinear form of the left invariant currents byintroducing a fermionic center to define the nondegenerate group metric. Thereparametrization invariance generators, whose combinations are conformalgenerators, and fermionic constraints, half of which generate kappa-symmetry,are obtained. Equations of motion are obtained in conformal invariant andbackground covariant manners.
