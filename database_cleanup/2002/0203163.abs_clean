We reanalyze brane inflation with brane-brane interactions at an angle, whichinclude the special case of brane-anti-brane interaction. If nature isdescribed by a stringy realization of the brane world scenario today (witharbitrary compactification), and if some additional branes were present in theearly universe, we find that an inflationary epoch is generically quitenatural, ending with a big bang when the last branes collide. In an interestingbrane inflationary scenario suggested by generic string model-building, we usethe density perturbation observed in the cosmic microwave background and thecoupling unification to find that the string scale is comparable to the GUTscale.
