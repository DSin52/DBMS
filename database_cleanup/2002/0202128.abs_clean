Title: Mirror symmetry and deformation quantization

Authors: Paul Bressler and Yan Soibelman

Differential GeometryThe paper is devoted to the comparison of the Fukaya category (it isresponcible for the A-side of mirror symmetry) with the category of holonomicmodules over the quantized algebra of functions on the same symplecticmanifold. We conjecture that these categories become $A_{\infty}$-equivalentafter a twist by a kind of integral transformation.
