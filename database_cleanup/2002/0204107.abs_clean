We introduce a simple coordinate system covering half of de Sitter space. TheKilling vector, the metric is smooth at the horizon, and constant-time slicesare just flat Euclidean space. We demonstrate the usefulness of the coordinatesby calculating the rate at which particles tunnel across the horizon. Whenself-gravitation is taken into account, the resulting tunneling rate is onlyapproximately thermal. The effective temperature decreases through the emissionof radiation.
