We discuss the signature of the scale of short distance physics in the CosmicMicrowave Background. In addition to effects which depend on the ratio ofHubble scale H during inflation to the energy scale M of the short distancephysics, there can be effects which depend on $\dot{\phi}^2/M^4$ where $\phi$is the {\it classical background} of the inflaton field. Therefore, theimprints of short distance physics on the spectrum of Cosmic MicrowaveBackground anisotropies generically involve a {\it double expansion}. Wepresent some examples of a single scalar field with higher order kinetic termscoupled to Einstein gravity, and illustrate that the effects of short distancephysics on the Cosmic Microwave Background can be substantial even for H << M,and generically involve corrections that are not simply powers of H/M. The sizeof such effects can depend on the short distance scale non-analytically eventhough the action is local.
