Title: Non BPS topological defect associated with two coupled real field

Authors: E. L. da Gra\c{c}a and R. de Lima Rodrigues

Comments: Revtex, 6 pages, no figures. This work was presented in the XXII

Brazilian National Meeting on Particles and Fields (October/2001), to appearWe investigate a stability equation involving two-component eigenfunctionswhich is associated with a potential model in terms of two coupled real scalarfields, which presents non BPS topological defect.
