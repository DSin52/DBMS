A new twisted deformation, U_z(so(4,2)), of the conformal algebra of the(3+1)-dimensional Minkowskian spacetime is presented. This construction isprovided by a classical r-matrix spanned by ten Weyl-Poincare generators, whichgeneralizes non-standard quantum deformations previously obtained for so(2,2)and so(3,2). However, by introducing a conformal null-plane basis it is foundthat the twist can indeed be supported by an eight-dimensional carriersubalgebra. By construction the Weyl-Poincare subalgebra remains as a Hopfsubalgebra after deformation. Non-relativistic limits of U_z(so(4,2)) are shownto be well defined and they give rise to new twisted conformal algebras ofGalilean and Carroll spacetimes. Furthermore a difference-differential masslessKlein-Gordon (or wave) equation with twisted conformal symmetry is constructedthrough deformed momenta and position operators. The deformation parameter isinterpreted as the lattice step on a uniform Minkowskian spacetime latticediscretized along two basic null-plane directions.
