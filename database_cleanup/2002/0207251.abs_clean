It is shown that the vacuum state of weakly interacting quantum fieldtheories can be described, in the Heisenberg picture, as a linear combinationof randomly distributed incoherent paths that obey classical equations ofmotion with constrained initial conditions. We call such paths"pseudoclassical" paths and use them to define the dynamics of quantumfluctuations. Every physical observable is assigned a time-dependent value oneach path in a way that respects the uncertainty principle, but in consequence,some of the standard algebraic relations between quantum observables are notnecessarily fulfilled by their time-dependent values on paths. We define"collective observables" which depend on a large number of independent degreesof freedom, and show that the dynamics of their quantum fluctuations can bedescribed in terms of unconstrained classical stochastic processes withoutreference to any additional external system or to an environment. Our analysiscan be generalized to states other than the vacuum. Finally, we compare ourformalism to the formalism of coherent states, and highlight their differences.
