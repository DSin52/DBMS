addedIn these lecture notes, I describe the motivation behind a recent formulationof a non-perturbative gravitational path integral for Lorentzian (instead ofthe usual Euclidean) space-times, and give a pedagogical introduction to itsmain features. At the regularized, discrete level this approach solves theproblems of (i) having a well-defined Wick rotation, (ii) possessing acoordinate-invariant cutoff, and (iii) leading to_convergent_ sums overgeometries. Although little is known as yet about the existence and nature ofan underlying continuum theory of quantum gravity in four dimensions, there arealready a number of beautiful results in d=2 and d=3 where continuum limitshave been found. They include an explicit example of the inequivalence of theEuclidean and Lorentzian path integrals, a non-perturbative mechanism for thecancellation of the conformal factor, and the discovery that causality can actas an effective regulator of quantum geometry.
