Title: Gravitating nonabelian solutions with NUT charge

Authors: Eugen Radu

Comments: 32 pages, LaTeX, 15 Figures

We argue that the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory presents nontrivial solutionswith a NUT charge. These solutions approach asymptotically the Taub-NUTspacetime. They are characterized by the NUT parameter, the mass and the nodenumbers of the magnetic potential and present both electric and magneticpotentials.=0D The existence of nontrivial Einstein-Yang-Mills solutions withNUT charge in the presence of a negative cosmological constant is alsodiscussed. We use the counterterm subtraction method to calculate the boundaryenergy-momentum tensor and the mass of these configurations. Also, dyon blackhole solutions with nonspherical event horizon topology are shown to exist fora negative cosmological constant.
