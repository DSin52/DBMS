Title: A Stable Supergravity Dual of Non-supersymmetric Glue

Authors: James Babington, David E. Crooks and Nick Evans

Comments: 20 pages, 3 figures

We study non-supersymmetric fermion mass and condensate deformations of theAdS/CFT Correspondence. The 5 dimensional supergravity flows are lifted to acomplete and remarkably simple 10 dimensional background. A brane probeanalysis shows that when all the fermions have an equal mass a positive mass isgenerated for all six scalar fields leaving non-supersymmetric Yang Millstheory in the deep infra-red. We numerically determine the potential, producedby the background, in the Schroedinger equation relevant to the study of O^++glueballs. The potential is a bounded well, providing evidence of stability andfor a discrete, confined spectrum. The geometry can also describe thesupergravity background around an (unstable) fuzzy 5-brane.
