physical interpretation re-written, added referencesWe study the physics of D-branes in the presence of constant Ramond-Ramondpotentials. In the string field theory context, we first develop a generalformalism to analyze open strings in gauge trivial closed string backgrounds,and then apply it both to the RNS string and within Berkovits' covariantformalism, where the results have the most natural interpretation. The mostremarkable finding is that, in the presence of a Dp-brane, both a constantparallel NS-NS B-field and R-R C^(p-1)-field do not solve the open/closedequations of motion, and induce the same non-vanishing open string tadpole.After solving the open string equations in the presence of this tadpole, andafter gauging away the closed string fields, one is left with a U(1) fieldstrength on the brane given by F = 1/2 (B - *C^(p-1)), where * is Hodge dualityalong the brane world-volume. One observes that this result differs from theusually assumed result F=B. Technically, this is due to the fact thatsupersymmetric and bosonic string world-sheet theories are different. Note,however, that the usual F+B combination is still the gauge invariantcombination. Also, the standard result F=B is, in the D3-brane case, notcompatible with S-duality. On the other hand our result, which is derivedautomatically given the general formalism, offers a non-trivial check ofS-duality, to all orders in F, and this leads to an S-dual invariant Moyaldeformation. Finally, in an appendix, we solve the source equation describingthe open superstring in a generic NS-NS and R-R closed string background,within the super Poincare covariant formalism.
