Title: Generalizations of normal ordering and their applications to quantum

field theory in gravitational and electromagnetic backgroundsAuthors: H. Nikolic

Comments: 11 pages

An elegant nonlocal method of extracting the positive (or the negative)frequency part of a field, based on knowledge of a 2-point function, is given.This leads to certain natural generalizations of the normal ordering of quantumfields in classical gravitational and electromagnetic backgrounds andilluminates the origin of the recently discovered nonlocalities related to alocal description of particles. A local description of particle creation bygravitational backgrounds is given, with emphasis on the case of black-holeevaporation. The formalism reveals a previously hidden relation between variousdefinitions of the particle current and those of the energy-momentum tensor.The implications to particle creation by classical backgrounds, as well as tothe relation between vacuum energy, dark matter, and cosmological constant, arediscussed.
