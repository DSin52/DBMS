We consider geometrical characteristics of monopole clusters of the latticeSU(2) gluodynamics. We argue that the polymer approach to the field theory isan adequate means to describe the monopole clusters. Both finite-size and theinfinite, or percolating clusters are considered. We find out that thepercolation theory allows to reproduce the observed distribution of thefinite-size clusters in their length and radius. Geometrical characteristics ofthe percolating cluster reflect, in turn, the basic properties of the groundstate of a system with a gap.
