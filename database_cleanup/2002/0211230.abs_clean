correctionsWe obtain a classification of $c=2$ rational conformal field theories arisingfrom a string compactification on $T^2$ in terms of Gauss' theory of binaryquadratic forms. As a byproduct, we find an identity which counts thecardinality of a certain double coset space defined for isometries between thediscriminant forms of rank two lattices.
