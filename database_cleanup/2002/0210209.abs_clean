We investigate compactifications with duality twists and their relation toorbifolds and compactifications with fluxes. Inequivalent compactifications areclassified by conjugacy classes of the U-duality group and result in gaugedsupergravities in lower dimensions with nontrivial Scherk-Schwarz potentials onthe moduli space. For certain twists, this mechanism is equivalent tointroducing internal fluxes but is more general and can be used to stabilizesome of the moduli. We show that the potential has stable minima with zeroenergy precisely at the fixed points of the twist group. In string theory, whenthe twist belongs to the T-duality group, the theory at the minimum has anexact CFT description as an orbifold. We also discuss more general twists bynonperturbative U-duality transformations.
