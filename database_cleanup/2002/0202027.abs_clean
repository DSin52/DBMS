Title: On the relation between effective supersymmetric actions in different

dimensionsAuthors: E.T. Akhmedov and A.V. Smilga

Comments: 15 pages, 2 figures

4--dimensional (supersymmetric) gauge theory is determined by the same graphsand is rigidly connected to the renormalization of the metric on the modulispace of the classical vacua of the corresponding reduced quantum mechanicalsystem. Supersymmetry provides constraints for possible modifications of themetric, and this gives us a simple proof of nonrenormalization theorems for theoriginal 4-dimensional theory. (ii) We establish a nontrivial relationshipbetween the effective (0+1)-dimensional and (1+1)-dimensional Lagrangia (thelatter represent conventionalKahlerian sigma models).
