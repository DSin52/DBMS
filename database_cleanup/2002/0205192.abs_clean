The entropy and information puzzles arising from black holes cannot beresolved if quantum gravity effects remain confined to a microscopic scale. Weuse concrete computations in nonperturbative string theory to argue for threekinds of nonlocal effects that operate over macroscopic distances. Theseeffects arise when we make a bound state of a large number of branes, and occurat the correct scale to resolve the paradoxes associated with black holes.
