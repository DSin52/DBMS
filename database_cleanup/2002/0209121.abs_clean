Title: Conformality and Unification of Gauge Couplings

Comments: 6 pages LaTeX. Talk at the First International Conference on String

Cosmology. Oxford, United Kingdom. July 2002By use of the AdS/CFT correspondence on orbifolds, models are derived whichcan contain the standard model of particle phenomenology. It will be assumedthat the theory becomes conformally invariant at a renormalization-groupfixed-point in the TeV region. A recent application to TeV unification isbriefly mentioned.
