Recently Hollands and Wald argued that inflation does not solve any of themajor cosmological problems. We explain why we disagree with their arguments.They also proposed a new speculative mechanism of generation of densityperturbations. We show that in their scenario the inhomogeneities responsiblefor the large scale structure observed today were generated at an epoch whenthe energy density of the hot universe was 10^{95} times greater than thePlanck density. The only way to avoid this problem is to assume that there wasa stage of inflation in the early universe.
