Exact solutions of classical gauge theories in even-dimensional (D=2n)spacetimes are discussed. Common and specific properties of these solutions areanalyzed for the particular dimensions D=2, D=4, and D=6. A consistentformulation of classical gauge field theories with pointlike charged or coloredparticles is proposed for D=6. The particle Lagrangian must then depend on theacceleration. The self-interaction of a point particle is considered for D=2and D=6. In D=2, radiation is absent and all processes are reversible. In D=6,the expression for the radiation rate and the equation of motion of aself-interacting particle are derived; from which follows that theZitterbewegung always leads to radiation. It is shown that non-Abeliansolutions are absent for any D not equal to 4; only Coulomb-like solutions,which correspond to the Abelian limit of the D-dimensional Yang--Mills--Wongtheory, are admitted.
