The stringy description for the instabilities in the $RR$ charged$D_{p}-\bar{D}_{p}$ pairs is now well understood in terms of the open stringtachyon condensation. The quantum interpretation presumably via the stringydescription for the instabilities in the $NSNS$-charged $F1-\bar{F1}$ and$NS5-\bar{NS5}$ pairs in IIA/IIB theories, however, has not been establishedyet. This would be partly because of the absence (for the $F1-\bar{F1}$ case)or our relatively poor understanding (for the $NS5-\bar{NS5}$ case) of theirworldvolume (gauge theory) dynamics. In the present work, using the well-knownquantum description for instabilities in the $RR$-charged $D_{p}-\bar{D}_{p}$systems and in the M-theory brane-antibrane systems and invoking appropriatestring dualities, the stringy nature of the instabilities in the $NSNS$-charged$F1-\bar{F1}$ and $NS5-\bar{NS5}$ systems has been uncovered. For theannihilations to string vacua, the quantum, stringy interpretations are simpleextensions of Sen's conjecture for those in $RR$-charged brane-antibranesystems.
