A small black hole attached to a brane in a higher dimensional space emittingquanta into the bulk may leave the brane as a result of a recoil. We constructa field theory model in which such a black hole is described as a massivescalar particle with internal degrees of freedom. In this model, theprobability of transition between the different internal levels followed byemission of massless quanta is identical to the probability of thermal emissioncalculated for the Schwarzschild black hole. The discussed recoil effectimplies that the thermal emission of the black holes, which might be created byinteraction of high energy particles in colliders, could be terminated and theenergy non-conservation can be observed in the brane experiments.
