Following recent work on the quantum Hall effect on $S^4$, we solve theLandau problem on the complex projective spaces ${\bf C}P^k$ and discussquantum Hall states for such spaces. Unlike the case of $S^4$, a finite spatialdensity can be obtained with a finite number of internal states for eachparticle. We treat the case of ${\bf C}P^2$ in some detail considering bothAbelian and nonabelian background fields. The wavefunctions are obtained andincompressibility of the Hall states is shown. The case of ${\bf C}P^3$ isrelated to the case of $S^4$.
