Title: Reduction of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the scattering amplitude of

the particles with spin 1 to system of the integral equations for invariantfunctionsAuthors: A. Yu. Loginov, V. N. Stibunov (Nuclear Physics Institute at Tomsk

Bethe-Salpeter equation for the massive particles with spin 1 is considered.The scattering amplitude decomposition of the particles with spin 1 byrelativistic tensors is derived. The transformation coefficients from helicityamplitudes to invariant functions is found. The integral equations system forinvariant functions is obtained and partial decomposition of this system isperformed. Equivalent system of the integral equation for the partial helicityamplitudes is presented.
