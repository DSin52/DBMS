We investigate the generation of primordial gravitational waves frominflation in braneworld cosmologies with extra dimensions. Advantage of usingprimordial gravitational waves to probe extra dimensions is that their theorydepends only on the geometry, not on the microscopic models of inflation andstabilization. D(D-3)/2 degrees of freedom of the free bulk gravitons areprojected onto the 3d brane as tensor, vector and scalar modes. We found thefollowing no-go results for a generic geometry of a five (or D) dimensionalwarped metric with four dimensional de Sitter (inflationary) slices and two (orinflation (with the Hubble parameter H) due to the gap in the KK spectrum; theuniversal lower bound on the gap is sqrt{3/2} H. Massless scalar and vectorprojections of the bulk gravitons are absent, unlike in geometries with KKcompactification.A massless 4d tensor mode is generated from inflation with the amplitudeH/M_P, where M_P is the effective Planck mass during inflation, derived fromthe D dimensional fundamental mass M_S and the volume of the inner dimensions.However, M_P for a curved dS braneworld may differ from that of the flat braneat low energies, either due to the H-dependence of the inner space volume orvariations in the brane separation before stabilization. Thus the amplitude ofgravitational waves from inflation in braneworld cosmology may be differentfrom that predicted by inflation in 4d theory.
