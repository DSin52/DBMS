FestschriftPhysical arguments stemming from the theory of black-hole thermodynamics areused to put constraints on the dynamics of closed-string tachyon condensationin Scherk--Schwarz compactifications. A geometrical interpretation of thetachyon condensation involves an effective capping of a noncontractible cycle,thus removing the very topology that supports the tachyons. A semiclassicalregime is identified in which the matching between the tachyon condensation andthe black-hole instability flow is possible. We formulate a generalizedan Euclidean interpretation of the transition from strings to black holesacross the Hagedorn temperature and instabilities in the brane-antibranesystem.
