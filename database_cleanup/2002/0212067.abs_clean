Title: Fluctuating brane in a dilatonic bulk

Authors: Philippe Brax, David Langlois, Maria Rodriguez-Martinez

Comments: 17 pages, 7 figures, revtex

We consider a cosmological brane moving in a static five-dimensional bulkspacetime endowed with a scalar field whose potential is exponential. Afterstudying various cosmological behaviours for the homogeneous background, weinvestigate the fluctuations of the brane that leave spacetime unaffected. Asingle mode embodies these fluctuations and obeys a wave equation which westudy for bouncing and ever-expanding branes.
