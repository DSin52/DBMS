A four-dimensional black hole solution of the Einstein equations with apositive cosmological constant, coupled to a conformal scalar field, is given.There is a curvature singularity at the origin, and scalar field divergesinside the event horizon. The electrically charged solution, which has a fixedcharge-to-mass ratio is also found. The quartic self-interacting couplingbecomes bounded in terms of Newton's and the cosmological constants.
