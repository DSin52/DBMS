Title: ERG as a tool for non-perturbative studies

Authors: Yuri A. Kubyshin

Comments: 13 pages, LaTeX, based on the talk given at the International

Conference "Renormalization Group-2002" (Tatranska Strba, Slovakia, March10-16, 2002)Basic elements of the exact renormalization group method and recent resultswithin this approach are reviewed. Topics covered are the derivation ofequations for the effective action and relations between them, derivativeexpansion, solutions of fixed point equations and the calculation of thecritical exponents, construction of the c-function and a description of thechiral phase transition.
