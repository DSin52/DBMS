It is shown that permanent confinement in three-dimensional compact U(1)gauge theory can be destroyed by matter fields in a deconfinement transition.This is a consequence of a non-trivial infrared fixed point caused by matter,and an anomalous scaling dimension of the gauge field. This leads to alogarithmic interaction between the defects of the gauge-fields, which form agas of magnetic monopoles. In the presence of logarithmic interactions, theoriginal electric charges are unconfined. The confined phase which is permanentin the absence of matter fields is reached at a critical electric charge, wherethe interaction between magnetic charges is screened by a pair unbindingtransition in a Kosterlitz-Thouless type of phase-transition.
