Title: Nonspherical Giant Gravitons and Matrix Theory

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX

We consider the plane wave limit of the nonspherical giant gravitons. Wecompute the Poisson brackets of the coordinate functions and find a nonlinearalgebra. We show that this algebra solves the supersymmetry conditions of thematrix model. This is the generalization of the algebraic realization of thespherical membrane as the ``fuzzy sphere''. We describe finite dimensionalrepresentations of the algebra corresponding to the fuzzy torus.
