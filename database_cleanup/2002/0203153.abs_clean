A generalization of the limiting procedure of Penrose, which allows non-zerocosmological constants and takes into account metrics that contain homogeneousfunctions of degree zero, is presented. It is shown that any spacetime whichadmits a spacelike conformal Killing vector has a limit which is conformal toplane waves. If the spacetime is an Einstein space, its limit exists only ifthe cosmological constant is negative or zero. When the conformal Killingvector is hypersurface orthogonal, the limits of Einstein spacetimes arecertain AdS plane waves. In this case the nonlinear version of theRandall-Sundrum zero mode is obtained as the limit of the brane worldscenarios.
