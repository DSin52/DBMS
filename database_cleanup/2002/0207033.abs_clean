Title: Contraints on matter from asymptotic safety

Authors: Roberto Percacci, Daniele Perini

Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, revtex4; conclusions changed

Recent studies of the ultraviolet behaviour of pure gravity suggest that itadmits a non-Gaussian attractive fixed point, and therefore that the theory isasymptotically safe. We consider the effect on this fixed point of masslessminimally coupled matter fields. The existence of a UV attractive fixed pointputs bounds on the type and number of such fields.
