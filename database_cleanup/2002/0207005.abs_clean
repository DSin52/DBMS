We construct in this paper a multi-brne model with Minkowski and AdSspacetime alternated in the fifth dimension and study the gravity on the braneof our universe. We will show that in this model there are both thegraviton-like resonant states which generates the "quasi-localized gravity" andthe resonant states of the massive KK mode. This model gives rise to gravitywhich deviates from the Newton gravitational potential at small and large scalewhich, however can be shown to be consistent with the observations in theabsence of fine-tuning of the model parameters.
