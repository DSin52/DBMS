A proposal is made for a cosmological D3/D7 model with a constant magneticflux along the D7 world-volume. It describes an N=2 gauge model withFayet-Iliopoulos terms and the potential of the hybrid P-term inflation. Themotion of the D3-brane towards D7 in a phase with spontaneously brokensupersymmetry provides a period of slow-roll inflation in the de Sitter valley,the role of the inflaton being played by the distance between D3 and D7-branes.bound state corresponding to an Abelian non-linear (non-commutative) instanton.In this model the existence of a non-vanishing cosmological constant isassociated with the resolution of the instanton singularity. We discuss apossible embedding of this model into a compactified M-theory setup.
