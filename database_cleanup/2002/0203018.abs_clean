Using the supergravity solution of $N_1$ D3-branes probing $A_{N_2-1}$singularities we study the pp-wave limit of $AdS_5\times S^5/Z_{N_2}$. We showthat there are two different pp-wave limits. One is the orbifold of the pp-wavelimit of $AdS_5\times S^5$. In this case there is no symmetry enhancement. Theother case is the same as the pp-wave limit of $AdS_5\times S^5$ and thereforewe again see the maximal supersymmetry. We will also identify operators in thefour dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ $SU(N_1)^{N_2}$ gauge theory which correspond tostringy excitations in the orbifolded pp-wave geometry. The existence of themaximal pp-wave geometry indicates that there is a subsector of thecorresponding ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theories which has enhanced ${\cal N}=4$supersymmetry. We also study the pp-wave limits of $AdS_{7,4}\timesS^{4,7}/Z_{N}$.
