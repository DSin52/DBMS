We consider a six dimensional brane world model with asymmetric warp factorsfor time and both extra spatial coordinates, $y$ and $z$. We derive the set ofdifferential equations governing the shortest graviton path and numericallysolve it for AdS-Schwarzschild and AdS-Reissner-Nordstr\"om bulks. In bothcases we derive a set of conditions for the existence of shortcuts in bulkswith shielded singularities and show some examples of shortcuts obtained underthese conditions. Consequences are discussed.
