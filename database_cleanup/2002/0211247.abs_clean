Comments: 7 pages, 1 figure

A family of spherically symmetric solutions with horizon in the model withmulti-component anisotropic fluid (MCAF) is obtained. The metric of anysolution contains n-1 Ricci-flat ``internal space'' metrics and for certainequations of state (p_i = \pm \rho) coincides with the metric of intersectingblack brane solution in the model with antisymmetric forms. Examples ofsimulation of intersecting M2 and M5 black branes are considered. Thepost-Newtonian parameters beta and gamma corresponding to the 4-dimensionalsection of the metric are calculated.
