Quant. GravWe present a review of the homological algebra tools involved in the standardde Rham theory and their subsequent generalizations relevant for theunderstanding of free massless higher spin gauge structure. M-theory argumentssuggest the existence of an extension of (Abelian) S-duality symmetry fornon-Abelian gauge theories, like the four dimensional Yang-Mills or Einsteintheories. Some no-go theorems prove that this extension, if it exists, shouldfall outside the scope of local perturbative field theory.
