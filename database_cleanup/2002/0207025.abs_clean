In the paper "Constraint Quantization of Open String in Background $B$ fieldand Noncommutative D-brane", it is claimed that the boundary conditions lead toan infinite set of secondary constraints and Dirac brackets result in anon-commutative Poisson structure for D-brain. Here we show that contrary tothe arguments in that paper, the set of secondary constraints on the boundaryis finite and the non-commutativity algebra can not be obtained by evaluatingthe Dirac brackets.
