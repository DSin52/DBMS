We construct Wigner's continuous spin representations of the Poincar\'ealgebra for massless particles in higher dimensions. The states are labeledboth by the length of a space-like translation vector and the Dynkin indices ofthe {\it short little group} $SO(d-3)$, where $d$ is the space-time dimension.Continuous spin representations are in one-to-one correspondence withrepresentations of the short little group. We also demonstrate how combinationsof the bosonic and fermionic representations form supermultiplets of thesuper-Poincar\'e algebra. If the light-cone translations are nilpotent, theserepresentations become finite dimensional, but contain zero or negative normstates, and their supersymmetry algebra contains a central charge in fourdimensions.
