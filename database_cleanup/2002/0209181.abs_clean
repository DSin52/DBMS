We have investigated the classical stability of magnetically charged black$p$-brane solutions for string theories that include the case studied byGregory and Laflamme. It turns out that the stability behaves very differentlydepending on a coupling parameter between dilaton and gauge fields. In the caseof Gregory and Laflamme, it has been known that the black brane instabilitydecreases monotonically as the charge of black branes increases and finallydisappears at the extremal point. For more general cases we found that, whenthe coupling parameter is small, black brane solutions become stable evenbefore reaching to the extremal point. On the other hand, when the couplingparameter is large, black branes are always unstable and moreover theinstability does not continue to decrease, but starts to increase again as theyapproach to the extremal point. However all extremal black branes are shown tobe stable even in this case. It has also been shown that main features of theclassical stability are in good agreement with the local thermodynamic behaviorof the corresponding black hole system through the Gubser-Mitra conjecture.Some implications of our results are also discussed.
