We construct the stress tensors for the p-adic string model and for the puretachyonic sector of open string field theory by naive metric covariantizationof the action. Then we give the concrete energy density of a lump solution ofthe p-adic model. In the cubic open bosonic string field theory, we also givethe energy density of a lump solution and pressure evolution of a rollingtachyon solution.
