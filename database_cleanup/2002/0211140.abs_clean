Title: Anyons, 't Hooft loops and a Generalized Connection in Three Dimensions

Authors: N. Itzhaki

Comments: 17 pages, typos corrected, ref. added

We consider a generalized connection in three dimensions and show that itemerges in Chern-Simons-Maxwell theories when one studies the disorderinstanton operator. We generalize this construction to non-Abelian theories andfind that the disorder operator (the 't Hooft operator) is equivalent to ageneralized Wilson loop in a representation that depends on the Chern-Simonsterm. We speculate about the effective action of the disorder operator and itsapplications to the possible phases of the theory in the infra-red. We alsoshow that fractional statistics can emerge in gauge theories without aChern-Simons term if the generalized connection rather than the ordinaryconnection is used to couple charged particles.
