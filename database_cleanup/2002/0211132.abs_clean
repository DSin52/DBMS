Title: Boundary sine-Gordon model

Authors: Z. Bajnok, L. Palla, G. Takacs

Comments: 15 pages, 7 eps figures, Talk presented at 'Workshop on Integrable

Theories, Solitons and Duality', 1-6 July 2002, Sao Paulo, BrazilWe review our recent results on the on-shell description of sine-Gordon modelwith integrable boundary conditions. We determined the spectrum of boundarystates together with their reflection factors by closing the boundary bootstrapand checked these results against WKB quantization and numerical finite volumespectra obtained from the truncated conformal space approach. The relationbetween a boundary resonance state and the semiclassical instability of astatic classical solution is analyzed in detail.
