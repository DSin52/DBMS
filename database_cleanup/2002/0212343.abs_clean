Letter BWe work out boundary conditions for the covariant open string in the type IIAplane wave background, which corresponds to the D-branes in the type IIAtheory. We use the kappa symmetric string action and see what kind of boundaryconditions should be imposed to retain kappa symmetry. We find half BPS as wellas quarter BPS branes and the analysis agrees with the previous work in thelight cone gauge if the result is available. Finally we find that D0-brane isnon-supersymmetric.
