We study warped compactifications to three dimensions, realized as anorientifold of type IIA string theory on T^7. By turning on 3- and 4-formfluxes on the torus in a supersymmetric way, we generate a potential for themoduli fields. We present various flux configurations with N=1,2,3,4,5,6supersymmetries and count the number of moduli in each case. In particular, weshow that there are N=1 configurations where all but one of the moduli arefrozen.
