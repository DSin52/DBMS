We show that the spacetime of the near-horizon limit of the extreme rotatingd=5 black hole, which is maximally supersymmetric in N=2,d=5 supergravity forany value of the rotation parameter j in [-1,1], is locally isomorphic to ahomogeneous non-symmetric spacetime corresponding to an element of the1-parameter family of coset spaces SO(2,1)x SO(3)/SO(2)_j in which the subgroupSO(2)_j is a combination of the two SO(2) subgroups of SO(2,1) and SO(3).
