It is shown that an action inspired from a BF and Chern-Simons model, basedon the $AdS_4$ isometry group SO(3, 2), with the inclusion of a Higgs potentialterm, furnishes the MacDowell-Mansouri-Chamseddine-West action for gravity,with a Gauss-Bonnet and cosmological constant term. The $AdS_4$ space is anatural vacuum of the theory. Using Vasiliev's procedure to construct higherspin massless fields in AdS spaces and a suitable star product, we discuss thepreliminary steps to construct the corresponding higher-spin action in $AdS_4$space representing the higher spin extension of this model. Brief remarks onNoncommutative Gravity are made.
