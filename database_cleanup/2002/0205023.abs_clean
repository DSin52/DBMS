A general method to easily build global and relative operators for any numbern of elementary systems if they are defined for 2 is presented. It is based onproperties of the morphisms valued in the tensor products of algebras of thekinematics and it allows also the generalization to any n of relations demon-strated for two. The coalgebra structures play a peculiar role in the explicitconstructions. Three examples are presented concerning the Galilei, Poincare'and deformed Galilei algebras.
