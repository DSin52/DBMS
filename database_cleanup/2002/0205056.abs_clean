A general framework for studying compactifications in supergravity and stringtheories was introduced by Candelas, Horowitz, Strominger and Witten. This wasfurther generalised to take into account the warp factor by de Wit, Smit andHari Dass. Though the prime focus of the latter was to find solutions withnontrivial warp factors (shown not to exist under a variety of circumstances),it was shown there that de Sitter compactifications are genericallydisfavoured. In this note we place these results in the context of a revivedinterest in de Sitter spacetimes .
