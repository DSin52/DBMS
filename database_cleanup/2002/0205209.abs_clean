We study the cosmology induced on a brane probing a warped throat region in aCalabi-Yau compactification of type IIB string theory. For the case of a BPSD3-brane probing the Klebanov-Strassler warped deformed conifold, the cosmologydescribed by a suitable brane observer is a bouncing, spatially flatFriedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with time-varying Newton's constant, whichpasses smoothly from a contracting to an expanding phase. In theKlebanov-Tseytlin approximation to the Klebanov-Strassler solution thecosmology would end with a big crunch singularity. In this sense, the warpeddeformed conifold provides a string theory resolution of a spacelikesingularity in the brane cosmology. The four-dimensional effective actionappropriate for a brane observer is a simple scalar-tensor theory of gravity.In this description of the physics, a bounce is possible because the relevantenergy-momentum tensor can classically violate the null energy condition.
