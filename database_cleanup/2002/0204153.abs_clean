We perform a systematic string computation of the masses of anomalous U(1)gauge bosons in four-dimensional orientifold vacua, and we study theirlocalization properties in the internal (compactified) space. We find that N=1supersymmetric sectors yield four-dimensional contributions, localized in thewhole six-dimensional internal space, while N=2 sectors give contributionslocalized in four internal dimensions. As a result, the U(1) gauge fields canbe much lighter than the string scale, so that when the latter is at the TeV,they can mediate new non-universal repulsive forces at submillimeter distancesmuch stronger than gravity. We also point out that even U(1)s which are free offour-dimensional anomalies may acquire non-zero masses as a consequence ofsix-dimensional anomalies.
