Non-supersymmetric multi-wall configurations are generically unstable. It isproposed that the stabilization in compact space can be achieved by introducinga winding number into the model. A BPS-like bound is studied for the energy ofconfiguration with nonvanishing winding number. Winding number is implementedin an ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model with two chiral scalarfields and a bound states of BPS and anti-BPS walls is found to exist innoncompact spaces. Even in compactified space $S^1$, this nontrivial boundstate persists above a critical radius of the compact dimension.
