International Sakharov Conference on Physics (Moscow, Lebedev Institute, June24-29, 2002), minor correctionsWe propose an extended BRST invariant Lagrangian quantization scheme ofgeneral gauge theories based on explicit realization of "modified triplecticalgebra" in general coordinates. All the known Lagrangian quantization schemesbased on the extended BRST symmetry are obtained by specifying the (free)parameters of that method.
