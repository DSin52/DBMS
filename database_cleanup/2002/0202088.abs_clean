Comments: 7 pages, typos fixed, references added, minor changes

In hep-th/9803002, Maldacena argued that in the light of the AdS/CFTcorrespondence as formulated by Witten and Gubser, Klebanov and Polyakov as arelation between partition functions, the expectation value of the Wilson loopin $\cal N$=4 SU(N) SYM is given by the worldsheet partition function with theaction formulated on an $AdS_5\times S^5$ background and the world sheet endingon the loop on the boundary of $AdS_5$. What we propose to do in this paper isto provide some alternative arguments as to why it should be so.
