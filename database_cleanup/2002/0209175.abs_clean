The construction of field theories with space-time symmetries, includingtensorial charges (i.e. of M-theory type), initiated in hep-th/9907011, isextended to include interaction. For SO(2,2) gravity in a tensorial space-time,with space-time symmetry consisting of Lorentz generators and "translations",represented by second-rank antisymmetric tensor, the cubic interaction termsare constructed by requirement of maintaining the gauge invariance property oftheory. This interaction is essentially unique.
