The equations of motion of quantum Yang - Mills theory (in the planar `largeN' limit), when formulated in Loop-space are shown to have an anomalous term,which makes them analogous to the equations of motion of WZW models. Theanomaly is the Jacobian of the change of variables from the usual ones i.e. theconnection one form $A $, to the holonomy $U$. An infinite dimensional Liealgebra related to this change of variables (the Lie algebra of loopsubstitutions) is developed, and the anomaly is interpreted as an element ofthe first cohomology of this Lie algebra. The Migdal-Makeenko equations areshown to be the condition for the invariance of the Yang-Mills generatingfunctional $Z$ under the action of the generators of this Lie algebra.Connections of this formalism to the collective field approach of Jevicki andSakita are also discussed.
