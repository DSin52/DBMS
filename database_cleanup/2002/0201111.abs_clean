Title: KT and HKT Geometries in Strings and in Black Hole Moduli Spaces

Comments: 26 pages, Contribution to the Proceedings of the Bonn workshop on

"Special Geometric Structures in String Theory", a change in terminology andsome other minor changesSome selected applications of KT and HKT geometries in string theory,supergravity, black hole moduli spaces and hermitian geometry are reviewed. Itis shown that the moduli spaces of a large class of five-dimensionalsupersymmetric black holes are HKT spaces. In hermitian geometry, it is shownthat a compact, conformally balanced, strong KT manifold whose associated KTconnection has holonomy contained in SU(n) is Calabi-Yau. The implication ofthis result in the context of some string compactifications is explained.
