We generalize the Brane Gas Cosmological Scenario to M-theory degrees offreedom, namely $M5$ and $M2$ branes. Without brane intersections, theBrandenberger Vafa(BV) arguments applied to M-theory degrees of freedomgenerically predict a large 6 dimensional spacetime. We show that intersectionsof $M5$ and $M2$ branes can instead lead to a large 4 dimensional spacetime.One dimensional intersections in 11D is related to (2,0) little strings (LST)on NS5 branes in type IIA. The gas regime of membranes in M-theory correspondsto the thermodynamics of LST obtained from holography. We propose a mechanismwhereby LST living on the worldvolume of NS5 (M5)-branes wrapping a fivedimensional torus, annihilate most efficiently in 3+1 dimensions leading to alarge 3+1 dimensional spacetime. We also show that this picture is consistentwith the gas approximation in M-theory.
