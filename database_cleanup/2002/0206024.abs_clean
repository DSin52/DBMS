We present a supersymmetric version of the two-brane Randall-Sundrumscenario, with arbitrary brane tensions T_1 and T_2, subject to the bound|T_{1,2}| \leq \sqrt{-6\Lambda_5}, where \Lambda_5 < 0 is the bulk cosmologicalconstant. Dimensional reduction gives N=1, D=4 supergravity, with cosmologicalconstant \Lambda_4 in the range \half\Lambda_5 \leq \Lambda_4 \leq 0. The casewith \Lambda_4 = 0 requires T_1 = -T_2 = \sqrt{-6\Lambda_5}. This work unifiesand generalizes previous approaches to the supersymmetric Randall-Sundrumscenario. It also shows that the Randall-Sundrum fine-tuning is not aconsequence of supersymmetry.
