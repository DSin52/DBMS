String representation of the $[U(1)]^{N-1}$ gauge-invariant dualAbelian-Higgs-type theory, which is relevant to the SU(N)-QCD with the$\Theta$-term and provides confinement of quarks, is derived. The N-dependenceof the Higgs vacuum expectation value is found, at which the tension of thestring joining quarks becomes N-independent, similarly to the real QCD.Contrary to that, the inverse coupling constant of the rigidity term of thisstring always behaves approximately as 1/N. A long-range Aharonov-Bohm-typeinteraction of a dyon (i.e., a quark which acquired a magnetic charge due tothe $\Theta$-term) with a closed electric string becomes nontrivial at $\Theta$not equal to $N\pi$ times an integer. On the contrary, at these critical valuesof $\Theta$, the scattering of dyons over strings is absent.
