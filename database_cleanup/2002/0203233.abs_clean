We study the IR dynamics of the type IIB supergravity solution describing ND3-branes and M fractional D3-branes on the resolved conifold. The baryon massand the tension of domain wall in the dual gauge theory are evaluated andcompared with those for the deformed conifold. The IR behavior of the solutionfor the general conifold is also discussed. We show that the area law behaviorof the Wilson loop is attributed to the existence of the locus in the IR wherethe D3-brane charge vanishes.
