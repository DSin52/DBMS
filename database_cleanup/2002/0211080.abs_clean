Title: On the Vacuum energy of a Color Magnetic Vortex

Authors: M. Bordag

Comments: 28 pages, 4 figures

We calculate the one loop gluon vacuum energy in the background of a colormagnetic vortex for SU(2) and SU(3). We use zeta functional regularization toobtain analytic expressions suitable for numerical treatment. The momentumintegration is turned to the imaginary axis and fast converging sums/integralsare obtained. We investigate numerically a number of profiles of thebackground. In each case the vacuum energy turns out to be positive increasingin this way the complete energy and making the vortex configuration lessstable. In this problem bound states (tachyonic modes) are present for allinvestigated profiles making them intrinsically unstable.
