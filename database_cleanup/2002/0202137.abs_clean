Title: An Invariant Action for Noncommutative Gravity in Four-Dimensions

Authors: A. H. Chamseddine (CAMS/AUB)

Comments: 11 pages. Paper shortened. Consideration is now limited to gravity in

four-dimensionsTwo main problems face the construction of noncommutative actions for gravityonly gauge groups that could be used with star products are the unitary groups.I propose an invariant gravitational action in D=4 dimensions based on theconstrained gauge group U(2,2) broken to $U(1,1)\times U(1,1).$ No metric isused, thus giving a naturally invariant measure. This action is generalized tothe noncommutative case by replacing ordinary products with star products. Thefour dimensional noncommutative action is studied and the deformed action tofirst order in deformation parameter is computed.
