The effective potential of quantized scalar field on fuzzy sphere isevaluated to the two-loop level. We see that one-loop potential behaves likethat in the commutative sphere and the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism of theradiatively symmetry breaking could be also shown in the fuzzy sphere system.In the two-loop level, we use the heavy-mass approximation and thehigh-temperature approximation to perform the evaluations. The results showthat both of the planar and nonplanar Feynman diagrams have inclinations torestore the symmetry breaking in the tree level. However, the contributionsfrom planar diagrams will dominate over those from nonplanar diagrams by afactor N^2. Thus, at heavy-mass limit or high-temperature system the quantumfield on the fuzzy sphere will behave like those on the commutative sphere. Wealso see that there is a drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom in thenonplanar diagrams when the particle wavelength is smaller than thenoncommutativity scale.
