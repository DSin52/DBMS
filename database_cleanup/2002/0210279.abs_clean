Title: Brane world in a texture

for the tachyonic mode, One figure has been replaced, To appear in PhysicalReview DWe study five dimensional brane physics induced by an O(2) texture formed inone extra dimension. The model contains two 3-branes of nonzero tension, andthe extra dimension is compact. The symmetry-breaking scale of the texturecontrols the particle hierarchy between the two branes. The TeV-scale particlesare confined to the negative-tension brane where the observer sees gravity asessentially four dimensional. The effect of massive Kaluza-Klein gravitons issuppressed.
