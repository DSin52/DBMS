The lower order terms of the heat kernel expansion at coincident points arecomputed in the context of finite temperature quantum field theory for flatspace-time and in the presence of general gauge and scalar fields which may benon Abelian and non stationary. The computation is carried out in the imaginarytime formalism and the result is fully consistent with invariance undertopologically large and small gauge transformations. The Polyakov loop is shownto play a fundamental role.
