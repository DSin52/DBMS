The possibility of obtaining singularity free cosmological solutions in fourdimensional effective actions motivated by string theory is investigated. Inthese effective actions, besides the Einstein-Hilbert term, the dilatonic andthe axionic fields are also considered as well as terms coming from theRamond-Ramond sector. A radiation fluid is coupled to the field equations,which appears as a consequence of the Maxwellian terms in the Ramond-Ramondsector. Singularity free bouncing solutions in which the dilaton is finite andstrictly positive are obtained for models with flat or negative curvaturespatial sections when the dilatonic coupling constant is such that $\omega < -3/2$, and only for models with negative curvature spatial sections when $\omega> - 3/2$, including the pure string case $\omega=-1$. The bounces are smoothlyconnected to the radiation dominated expansion phase of the standardcosmological model, and the asymptotic pasts correspond to very large flatspacetimes.
