We compute the correlation functions of R-charge currents and components ofthe stress-energy tensor in the strongly coupled large-N finite-temperature N=4supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, following a recently formulated MinkowskianAdS/CFT prescription. We observe that in the long-distance, low-frequencylimit, such correlators have the form dictated by hydrodynamics. We deduce fromthe calculations the R-charge diffusion constant and the shear viscosity. Thevalue for the latter is in agreement with an earlier calculation based on theKubo formula and absorption by black branes.
