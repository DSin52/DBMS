Title: BMN Operators and Superconformal Symmetry

Authors: Niklas Beisert

Comments: 38 pages, v2

Implications of N=4 superconformal symmetry on Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase(BMN) operators with two charge defects are studied both at finite charge J andin the BMN limit. We find that all of these belong to a single longsupermultiplet explaining a recently discovered degeneracy of anomalousdimensions on the sphere and torus. The lowest dimensional component is anoperator of naive dimension J+2 transforming in the [0,J,0] representation ofSU(4). We thus find that the BMN operators are large J generalisations of theKonishi operator at J=0. We explicitly construct descendant operators bysupersymmetry transformations and investigate their three-point functions usingsuperconformal symmetry.
