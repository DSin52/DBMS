Title: Stability of the fuzzy sphere solution from matrix model

Authors: Paolo Valtancoli

Comments: 19 pages, LaTeX, no figures

We consider a matrix model depending on a parameter $\lambda$ which permitsthe fuzzy sphere as a classical background.By expanding the bosonic matricesaround this background ones recovers a U(1) (U(n)) noncommutative gauge theoryon the fuzzy sphere. To check classical stability of this background, we lookfor new classical solutions of this model and find them for $\lambda < 1$, thatmake the fuzzy sphere solution unstable for $\lambda < \half$ and stableotherwise. \\
