In the cubic string field theory, using the gauge invariant operatorscorresponding to the on-shell closed string vertex operators, we haveexplicitly evaluated the decay amplitudes of two open string tachyons or gaugefields to one closed string tachyon or graviton up to level two. We thenevaluated the same amplitudes in the bosonic string theory, and shown that theamplitudes in both theories have exactly the same pole structure. We have alsoexpanded the decay amplitudes in the bosonic string theory around theMandelstam variable s=0, and shown that their leading contact terms are fullyconsistent with a tachyonic Dirac-Born-Infeld action which includes both openstring and closed string tachyon.
