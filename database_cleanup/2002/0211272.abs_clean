We have analyzed IIB matrix model based on the improved mean fieldapproximation (IMFA) and have obtained a clue that the four-dimensionalspace-time appears as its most stable vacuum. This method is a systematic wayto give an improved perturbation series and was first applied to IIB matrixmodel by Nishimura and Sugino. In our previous paper we reformed this methodand proposed a criterion for convergence of the improved series, that is, theappearance of the ``plateau''. In this paper, we perform higher ordercalculations, and find that our improved free energy tends to have a plateau,which shows that IMFA works well in IIB matrix model.
