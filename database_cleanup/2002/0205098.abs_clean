We investigate the rolling of the tachyon on the unstable D9 brane in TypeIIA string theory by studying the BSFT action. The action is known for linearprofiles of the tachyon, which is the expected asymptotic behavior of thetachyon as it approaches the closed string vacuum, as recently described bySen. We find that the action does indeed seem consistent with the general Sendescription, in that it implies a constant energy density with diminishingpressure. However, the details are somewhat different from an effective fieldtheory of Born-Infeld type. For instance, the BSFT action implies there arepoles for certain rolling velocities, while a Born-Infeld action would have acut. We also find that solutions with pressure diminishing from either thepositive or negative side are possible.
