clarityWe find the parameters of the MSSM in terms of bulk supergravity fields forthe D-brane model of Berenstein, Jejjala and Leigh (hep-ph/0105042). The modelconsists of a D3-brane at the singularity of a non-abelian orbifold\Delta_{27}, which gives the particles of the Supersymmetric Standard Model. Wecompute the action for the D-brane fields in the presence of bothsupersymmetric and supersymmetry breaking background fluxes. We get quark,lepton, gaugino, Higgsino, scalar partners and Higgs masses, as well as softtrilinear couplings, as functions of the background fields. This work developsa framework for connecting MSSM phenomenology to brane compactifications.
