In this paper, we paraquantize the spinning string theory in theNeuveu-Shwarz model. Both the center of mass variables and the excitation modesof the string verify paracommutation relations. Except the $[p^{\mu},p^{\nu}]$commutator, the two other commutators of Poincar\'e algebra are satisfied. Withthe sole use of trilinear relations we find existence possibilities of spinningstrings at space-time dimensions other than D=10.
