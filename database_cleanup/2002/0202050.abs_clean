EffectThe quantum Hall effect is studied by introducing two different matrixvariables for electrons and holes, having Chern-Simons type interactions. Bygeneralizing the constraint condition proposed by Susskind to realize thePauli's exclusion principle in this two component matrix model, the classicalexciton solution having excitation of both quasi-electron and quasi-hole isobtained. The constraint condition is also solved quantum mechanically in theinfinite-sized matrix case, giving the examples of the physical states. Usingthese quantum states, the corrections of the exciton energy, coming from thenoncommutativity of space (Pauli principle) and from the quantum effects of thebackground state, are estimated in the lowest order perturbation expansion. Asa result, the dispersion relation of exciton is obtained.
