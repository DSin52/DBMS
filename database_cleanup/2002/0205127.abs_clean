Casimir energy for solid conducting ball is considered on the base of somefinite models. One model is physical and built of a battery of parallelmetallic plates. Two finite models are based on the Higgs model ofsuperconductivity. One of them is supersymmetric and based on the Witten fieldmodel for superconducting strings. Treatment shows that contribution of Casimirenergy can be very essential for superdence state in the neutron stars andnuclear matter.
