Brook, Dec. 1-2, 2001, 35pp., 1 fig., LaTeX twiceWe discuss the problem of introducing background spacetimes of the de Sittertype (quintessential backgrounds) in the context of fundamental theoriesinvolving supersymmetry. The role of a model presented in 1984, showing thatthese backgrounds can occur as spontaneously broken phases of locallysupersymmetric 4D, N-extended theories, is highlighted. The present twinchallenges of the presumed presence of supersymmetry in particle physics andthe emergence of experimental evidence for a positive cosmological constantfrom type-II supernovae data are noted for the continued investigation ofsuperstring/M-theory. Finally we note how the 1984-model may have a role toplay in future investigations.
