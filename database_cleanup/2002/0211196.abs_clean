We present a linearized gravity investigation of the bent braneworld, wherean AdS_4 brane is embedded in AdS_5. While we focus on static sphericallysymmetric mass distributions on the brane, much of the analysis continues tohold for more general configurations. In addition to the identification of themassive Karch-Randall graviton and a tower of Kaluza-Klein gravitons, we find aradion mode that couples to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor on thebrane. The Karch-Randall radion arises as a property of the embedding of thebrane in the bulk space, even in the context of a single brane model.
