Title: Nonabelian 2-Forms

Authors: C. Hofman

Comments: 22 pages, LaTeX

We study gauge theories based on nonabelian 2-forms. Certain connections onloop space give rise to generalized covariant derivatives that include anonabelian 2-form. This can be used to find rather straightforward expressionsfor the field strength and gauge transformations. As a special case we recoverformulas for connections on nonabelian gerbe, as recently constructed inmathematics. The general construction gives rise to connections on algebrabundles, which might be relevant for D-branes in the presence of torsion. Weconstruct BV sigma model actions for these connections and discuss their gaugefixing. We find both Yang-Mills type and topological BF type actions.
