Starting from the non-supersymmetric, tachyon-free orientifold of type 0string theory, we construct four-dimensional brane world models with D6-branesintersecting at angles on internal tori. They support phenomenologicallyinteresting gauge theories with chiral fermions. Despite the theory beingnon-supersymmetric the perturbative scalar potential induced at leading orderis shown to stabilize geometric moduli, leaving only the dilaton tadpoleuncanceled. As an example we present a three generation model with gauge groupand fermion spectrum close to a left-right symmetric extension of the StandardModel.
