We study gauge transformations of the Hata-Kawano vector state on a D25-branein the framework of vacuum string field theory. We show that among the infinitenumber of components of the polarization vector, all the components except onespacetime vector degree of freedom are gauge freedom, and give string fieldgauge transformations reproducing gauge transformations of the constant modesof the U(1) gauge field. These gauge transformations can be used to fix thenormalization of the vector field. We also discuss a difficulty in obtaining agauge invariant action of the vector field. Our arguments rely on thefactorization ansatz of gauge transformations.
