We solve the problem of finding all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of theNeumann matrix of the matter sector of open bosonic string field theory,including the zero modes, and switching on a background B-field. We give thediscrete eigenvalues as roots of transcendental equations, and we giveanalytical expressions for all the eigenvectors.
