Euclidean d=3 SU(2) Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons (YMCS) theory, includingGeorgi-Glashow (GGCS) theory, may have solitons in the presence of appropriatemass terms. For integral CS level k and for solitons carrying integral CSnumber, YMCS is gauge-invariant and consistent. However, individual solitonssuch as sphalerons and linked center vortices with CS number of 1/2 andwrithing center vortices with arbitrary CS number are non-compact; a condensateof them threatens compactness of the theory. We study various forms of thenon-compact theory in the dilute-gas approximation, treating the parameters of1) YMCS theory dynamically compactifies; non-compact YMCS have infinitelyhigher vacuum energy than compact YMCS. 2) An odd number of sphalerons isassociated with a domain- wall sphaleron, a pure-gauge configuration on aclosed surface enclosing them and with a half-integral CS number. 3) Weinterpret the domain-wall sphaleron in terms of fictitious closed Abelianmagnetic field lines that express the links of the Hopf fibration. Sphaleronsare over- and under-crossings of knots in the field lines; the domain-wallsphaleron is a superconducting wall confining these knots to a compact domain.4) Analogous results hold for center vortices and nexuses. 5) For a CS terminduced with an odd number of fermion doublets, domain-wall sphalerons arerelated to non-normalizable fermion modes. 6) GGCS with monopoles iscompactified with center-vortex-like strings.
