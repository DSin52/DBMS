Title: Speculative generalization of black hole uniqueness to higher dimensions

Authors: Barak Kol

Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures

A straightforward generalization of the celebrated uniqueness theorem todimensions greater than four was recently found to fail in two pure gravitycases - the 5d rotating black ring and the black string on R^{3,1} * S^1. Twoamendments are suggested here (without proof) in order to rectify thesituation. The first is that in addition to specifying the mass and angularmomentum (and gauge charges) one needs to specify the horizon topology as well.Secondly, the theorem may survive if applied exclusively to stable solutions.Note that the latter is at odds with the proposed stable but non-uniformstring.
