Desert 2002, Oulu (Finland), June 2-7 2002 minor typos corrected, referencesaddedI review some aspects of non-critical strings in connection withLorentz-Invariance violating approaches to quantum gravity. I also argue hownon-critical strings may provide a unifying framework where string Cosmologyand quantum gravity may be tackled together.
