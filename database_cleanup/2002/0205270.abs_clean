The pp-wave (Penrose limit) in conformal field theory can be viewed as aspecial contraction of the unitary representations of the conformal group. Westudy the kinematics of conformal fields in this limit in a geometric approachwhere the effect of the contraction can be visualized as an expansion ofspace-time. We discuss the two common models of space-time as carrier spacescoset of the conformal group over its maximal compact subgroup. We show thatonly the latter manifold and the corresponding conformal representation theoryadmit a non-singular contraction limit. We also address the issue ofcorrelation functions of conformal fields in the pp-wave limit. We show thatthey have a well-defined contraction limit if their space-time dependencemerges with the dependence on the coordinates of the R symmetry group. This isa manifestation of the fact that in the limit the space-time and R symmetriesbecome indistinguishable. Our results might find applications in actualcalculations of correlation functions of composite operators in N=4 superYang-Mills theory.
