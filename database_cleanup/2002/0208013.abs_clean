In this paper we consider the implications of a cosmological constant for theevolution of the universe, under a set of assumptions motivated by theholographic and horizon complementarity principles. We discuss the ``causalpatch" description of spacetime required by this framework, and present somesimple examples of cosmologies described this way. We argue that theseassumptions inevitably lead to very deep paradoxes, which seem to require majorrevisions of our usual assumptions.
