We study the quantum stability of Type IIB orbifold and orientifold stringmodels in various dimensions, including Melvin backgrounds, where supersymmetry(SUSY) is broken {\it \`a la} Scherk-Schwarz (SS) by twisting periodicityconditions along a circle of radius R. In particular, we compute theR-dependence of the one-loop induced vacuum energy density $\rho(R)$, orcosmological constant. For SS twists different from Z2 we always find, for bothorbifolds and orientifolds, a monotonic $\rho(R)<0$, eventually driving thesystem to a tachyonic instability. For Z2 twists, orientifold models can have adifferent behavior, leading either to a runaway decompactification limit or toa negative minimum at a finite value R_0. The last possibility is obtained fora 4D chiral orientifold model where a more accurate but yet preliminaryanalysis seems to indicate that $R_0\to \infty$ or towards the tachyonicinstability, as the dependence on the other geometric moduli is included.
