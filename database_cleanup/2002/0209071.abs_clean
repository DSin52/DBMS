Title: Riemann surfaces, separation of variables and classical and quantum

integrabilityAuthors: O. Babelon, M. Talon

Systems; Quantum AlgebraWe show that Riemann surfaces, and separated variables immediately provideclassical Poisson commuting Hamiltonians. We show that Baxter's equations forseparated variables immediately provide quantum commuting Hamiltonians. Theconstruction is simple, general, and does not rely on the Yang--Baxterequation.
