We describe two extensions of the notion of a self-dual connection in avector bundle over a manifold M from dim M=4 to higher dimensions. The firstextension, Omega-self-duality, is based on the existence of an appropriate4-form Omega on the Riemannian manifold M and yields solutions of theYang-Mills equations. The second is the notion of half-flatness, which isdefined for manifolds with certain Grassmann structure T^C M \cong E \otimes H.In some cases, for example for hyper-Kaehler manifolds M, half-flatness impliesOmega-self-duality. A construction of half-flat connections inspired by theharmonic space approach is described. Locally, any such connection can beobtained from a free prepotential by solving a system of linear first orderODEs.
