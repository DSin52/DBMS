A brief, example-oriented introduction is given to special holonomy and itsuses in string theory and M-theory. We discuss A_k singularities and theirresolution; the construction of a K3 surface by resolving T^4/Z_2; holomorphiccycles, calibrations, and worldsheet instantons; aspects of the low-energyeffective action for string compactifications; the significance of the standardembedding of the spin connection in the gauge group for heterotic stringcompactifications; G_2 holonomy and its relation to N=1 supersymmetriccompactifications of M-theory; certain isolated G_2 singularities and theirresolution; the Joyce construction of compact manifolds of G_2 holonomy; therelation of D6-branes to M-theory on special holonomy manifolds; gauge symmetryenhancement from light wrapped M2-branes; and chiral fermions from intersectingbranes. These notes are based on lectures given at TASI '01.
