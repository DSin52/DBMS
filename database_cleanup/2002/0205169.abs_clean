We propose a dynamical matrix product ansatz describing the stochasticdynamics of two species of particles with excluded-volume interaction and thequantum mechanics of the associated quantum spin chains respectively. Analyzingconsistency of the time-dependent algebra which is obtained from the action ofthe corresponding Markov generator, we obtain sufficient conditions on thehopping rates for identifing the integrable models. From the dynamical algebrawe construct the quadratic algebra of Zamolodchikov type, associativity ofwhich is a Yang Baxter equation. The Bethe ansatz equations for the spectra areobtained directly from the dynamical matrix product ansatz.
