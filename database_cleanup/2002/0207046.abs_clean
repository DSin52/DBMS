Title: Perturbative--nonperturbative connection in quantum mechanics and field

theoryAuthors: Gerald V. Dunne

Comments: 17 pp, 9 figures; Review talk at ArkadyFest Symposium, May 2002,

MinneapolisOn the occasion of this ArkadyFest, celebrating Arkady Vainshtein's 60thbirthday, I review some selected aspects of the connection between perturbativeand nonperturbative physics, a subject to which Arkady has made many importantcontributions. I first review this connection in quantum mechanics, which wasthe subject of Arkady's very first paper. Then I discuss this issue in relationto effective actions in field theory, which also touches on Arkady's work onoperator product expansions. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of a specialquantum mechanical system, a quasi-exactly solvable model withenergy-reflection duality, which exhibits an explicit duality between theperturbative and nonperturbative sectors, without invoking supersymmetry.
