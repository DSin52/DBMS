Title: Seiberg-Witten Prepotential From Instanton Counting

Comments: harvmac 31 pp

Direct evaluation of the Seiberg-Witten prepotential is accomplishedfollowing the localization programme suggested some time ago. Our results agreewith all low-instanton calculations available in the literature. We present atwo-parameter generalization of the Seiberg-Witten prepotential, which israther natural from the M-theory/five dimensional perspective, and conjectureits relation to the tau-functions of KP/Toda hierarchy.
