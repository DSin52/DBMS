We investigate cosmological evolution in models where the effective potentialV(\phi) may become negative for some values of the field \phi. Phase portraitsof such theories in space of variables (\phi,\dot\phi,H) have severalqualitatively new features as compared with phase portraits in the theorieswith V(\phi) > 0. Cosmological evolution in models with potentials with a"stable" minimum at V(\phi)<0 is similar in some respects to the evolution inmodels with potentials unbounded from below. Instead of reaching an AdS regimedominated by the negative vacuum energy, the universe reaches a turning pointwhere its energy density vanishes, and then it contracts to a singularity withproperties that are practically independent of V(\phi). We apply our methods toinvestigation of the recently proposed cyclic universe scenario. We show thatin addition to the singularity problem there are other problems that need to beresolved in order to realize a cyclic regime in this scenario. We proposeseveral modifications of this scenario and conclude that the best way toimprove it is to add a usual stage of inflation after the singularity and usethat inflationary stage to generate perturbations in the standard way.
