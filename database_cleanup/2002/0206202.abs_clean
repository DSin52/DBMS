We explore a classical instability of spacetimes of dimension $D>4$. Firstly,The dangerous mode is a tensor mode on an Einstein base manifold of dimension$D-2$. A criterion for instability is found for the generalised Schwarzschild,AdS-Schwarzschild and topological black hole spacetimes in terms of theLichnerowicz spectrum on the base manifold. Secondly, we consider perturbationssubject to the usual limitations of a linear analysis, any Ricci flat spacetimemay be stabilised by embedding into a higher dimensional spacetime withcosmological constant. We apply our results to pure AdS black strings. Finally,we study the stability of higher dimensional ``bubbles of nothing''.
