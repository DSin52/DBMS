We extend the perturbative approach developed in an earlier work to deal withLagrangians which have arbitrary higher order time derivative terms for bothbosons and fermions. This approach enables us to find an effective Lagrangianwith only first time derivatives order by order in the coupling constant. As inthe pure bosonic case, to the first order, the quantized Hamiltonian is boundedfrom below whenever the potential is. We show in the example of a singlecomplex fermion that higher derivative interactions result in an effective massand change of vacuum for the low energy modes. The supersymmetricnoncommutative Wess-Zumino model is considered as another example. We alsocomment on the higher derivative terms in Witten's string field theory and theeffectiveness of level truncation.
