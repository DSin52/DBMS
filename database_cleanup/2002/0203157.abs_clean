Title: Low-energy structure of six-dimensional open-string vacua

Comments: 165 pages, LaTeX, Ph.D. thesis

This dissertation reviews some properties of the low-energy effective actionsfor six dimensional open-string models. The first chapter is a pedagogicalintroduction about supergravity theories. In the second chapter closed stringsare analyzed, with particular emphasis on type IIB, whose orientifoldprojection, in order to build type-I models, is the subject of the thirdchapter. Original results are reported in chapters 4 and 5. In chapter 4 wedescribe the complete coupling of (1,0) six-dimensional supergravity to tensor,vector and hypermultiplets. The generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism impliesthat the resulting theory embodies factorized gauge and supersymmetryanomalies, to be disposed of by fermion loops. Consequently, the low-energytheory is determined by the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, rather than bythe requirement of supersymmetry, and this procedure does not fix a quarticcoupling for the gauginos. In chapter 5 we describe the low-energy effectiveactions for type-I models with brane supersymmetry breaking, resulting form thesimultaneous presence of supersymmetric bulks, with one or more gravitinos, andnon-supersymmetric combinations of BPS branes.The consistency of the resultinggravitino couplings implies that local supersymmetry is non-linearly realizedon some branes. We analyze in detail the ten-dimensional $USp(32)$ model andthe six-dimensional (1,0) models.
