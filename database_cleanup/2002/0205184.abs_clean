We describe how chiral matter charged under SU(N) and SO(2N) gauge groupsarises from codimension seven singularities in compactifications of M-theory onmanifolds with G(2) holonomy. The geometry of these spaces is that of a coneover a six-dimensional Einstein space which can be constructed by (multiple)unfolding of hyper-Kahler quotient spaces. In type IIA the correspondingpicture is given by stacks of intersecting D6-branes and chiral matter arisesfrom open strings stretching between them. Usually one obtains (bi)fundamentalrepresentations but by including orientifold six-planes in the type IIA picturewe find more exotic representations like the anti-symmetric, which is importantfor the study of SU(5) grand unification, and trifundamental representations.We also exhibit many cases where the G(2) metrics can be described explicitly,although in general the metrics on the spaces constructed via unfolding are notknown.
