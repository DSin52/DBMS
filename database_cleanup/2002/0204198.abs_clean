For n+1 dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes which have holographicduals on their n dimensional conformal boundaries, we show that the impositionof causality on the boundary theory is sufficient to prove positivity of massfor the spacetime when n > 2, without the assumption of any local energycondition. We make crucial use of a generalization of the time-delay formulacalculated in gr-qc/9404019, which relates the time delay of a bulk null curvewith respect to a boundary null geodesic to the Ashtekar-Magnon mass of thespacetime. We also discuss holographic causality for the negative mass AdSsoliton and its implications for the positive energy conjecture of Horowitz andMyers.
