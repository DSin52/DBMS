misprints correctedWe consider quantum electrodynamics with additional coupling of spinor fieldsto the space-time independent axial vector violating both Lorentz and CPTsymmetries. The Fock-Schwinger proper time method is used to calculate theone-loop effective action up to the second order in the axial vector and to allorders in the space-time independent electromagnetic field strength. We findthat the Chern-Simons term is not radiatively induced and that the effectiveaction is CPT invariant in the given approximation.
