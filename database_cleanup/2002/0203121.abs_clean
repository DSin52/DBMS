Authors: Giorgio Immirzi, Badis Ydri

Comments: To appear in the Conference Proceedings

Physics Conference SUNY UTICA/ROME NY, Fall 2001In this talk we give a brief description of the formulation of chiral andgauge symmetries on the fuzzy sphere . In particular fermion doublers are shownto be absent and the correct anomaly equation in two dimensions is obtained inthe corresponding continuum limit .
