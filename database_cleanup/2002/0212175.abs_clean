In five-dimensional supergravity, an exact solution of BPS wall is found fora gravitational deformation of the massive Eguchi-Hanson nonlinear sigma model.The warp factor decreases for both infinities of the extra dimension. Thin walllimit gives the Randall-Sundrum model without fine-tuning of input parameters.We also obtain wall solutions with warp factors which are flat or increasing inone side, by varying a deformation parameter of the potential.
