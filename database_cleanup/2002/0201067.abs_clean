XVI-th Max Born SymposiumWe present here a detailed analysis of the local symmetries of supergravityin an arbitrary dimension D, both in the component and superfield approaches,using a field-space democracy point of view. As an application, we discussbriefly how a complete description of the local gauge symmetries clarifies theproperties of the supergravity-superbrane coupled system in the standardbackground superfield approximation for supergravity.
