Title: Consistency of the Symplectic Projectors Method on Multidimensional

Gauge ModelsComments: PhD Thesis in portuguese, 55 pages LaTex

In this paper we apply the Symplectic Projectors Method to gauge theorieswith second class constraints in various space-time dimensions. The conclusionis that this method is equivalent to the standard quantization methods.Although it suffers from some limitations since its applicability is restrictedto some simpler situation when one is not interested in full informationprovided by the BRST, our analysis shows that it is worthwhile to investigatethis method further.
