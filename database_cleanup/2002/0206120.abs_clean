Pre-Quantum MechanicsComments: Draft of a book; 175 pages in TeX. Comments welcome; revisions as

needed will be made around 10/1/02We consider the classical dynamics of bosonic and fermionic matrix variablesin complex Hilbert space, defined by a trace action, assuming cyclic invarianceunder the trace and the presence of a global unitary invariance. With plausibleand explicitly stated assumptions, including the existence of a large hierarchyof scale between the underlying dynamics and observed physics, we show that (1)the equilibrium statistical mechanics of this matrix dynamics, in the canonicalensemble, gives rise to an emergent quantum mechanics for many degrees offreedom, including the standard canonical commutation/anticommutation relationsand the usual unitary Heisenberg and Schr\"odinger picture time evolutions ofoperators and states, and (2) the fluctuation or Brownian motion corrections tothis thermodyamics lead to an energy-driven stochastic modification of theSchr\"odinger equation, which is known to imply state vector reduction withBorn rule probabilities. Thus, quantum mechanics and its probabilisticinterpretation both arise as emergent phenomena in the underlying tracedynamics.
