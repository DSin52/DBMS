Title: Black Holes, Hawking Radiation and the Information Paradox

Authors: Marvin Weinstein

Comments: 11 pages, 1 figure, talk given at Sakharov Conference on Physics 2002

This talk is about results obtained by Kirill Melnikov and myself pertainingto the canonical quantization of a massless scalar field in the presence of aSchwarzschild black hole. After a brief summary of what we did and how wereproduce the familiar Hawking temperature and energy flux, I focus attentionon how our discussion differs from other treatments. In particular I show thatwe can define a system which fakes an equilibrium thermodynamic object whoseentropy is given by the $A/4$ (where $A$ is the area of the black holehorizon), but for which the assignment of a classical entropy to the system isincorrect. Finally I briefly discuss a discretized version of the theory whichseems to indicate that things work in a surprising way near $r=0$.
