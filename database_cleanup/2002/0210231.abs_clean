corrected, references addedThe worldsheet renormalization group approach to tachyon condensation instring theory is reviewed. The open string case is summarized with examples,and closed string tachyon condensation on nonsupersymmetric orbifolds isexamined in detail. The idea that the renormalization group dissipates thelocalized states associated to the defect is explored.
