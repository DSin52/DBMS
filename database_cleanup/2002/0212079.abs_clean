and refs. addedDijkgraaf and Vafa have conjectured the correspondences between topologicalstring theories, ${\cal N}=1$ gauge theories and matrix models. By the use ofthis conjecture, we calculate the quantum deformations of Calabi-Yau threefoldswith ADE singularities from ADE multi-matrix models. We obtain the effectivesuperpotentials of the dual quiver gauge theories in terms of the geometricengineering for the deformed geometries. We find the Veneziano-Yankielowiczterms in the effective superpotentials.
