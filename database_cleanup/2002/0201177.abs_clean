In vacuum string field theory, the sliver state solution has been proposed asa candidate of a D-brane configuration. Physical observables associated withthis solution, such as its energy density and the tachyon mass, are written interms of the Neumann coefficients. These observables, though vanish naively dueto twist symmetry, acquire non-vanishing values arising from their singularbehavior. Therefore, this phenomenon is called twist anomaly. In this paper wepresent an analytical derivation of these physical observables with the help ofthe star algebra spectroscopy. We also identify in our derivation the origin ofthe twist anomaly in the finite-size matrix regularization.
