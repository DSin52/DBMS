Title: Closed String Amplitudes from Gauge Fixed String Field Theory

Authors: Nadav Drukker

Comments: 10 pages, revtex, 3 figures

Closed string diagrams are derived from cubic open string field theory usinga gauge fixed kinetic operator. The basic idea is to use a string propagatorthat does not generate a boundary to the world sheet. Using this propagator andthe closed string vertex, the moduli space of closed string surfaces iscovered, so closed string scattering amplitudes should be reproduced. Thiskinetic operator could be a gauge fixed form of the string field theory actionaround the closed string vacuum.
