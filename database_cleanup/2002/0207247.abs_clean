Hawking radiation can usefully be viewed as a semi-classical tunnelingprocess that originates at the black hole horizon. The same basic premiseshould apply to de Sitter background radiation, with the cosmological horizonof de Sitter space now playing the featured role. In fact, a recent work[hep-th/0204107] has gone a long way to verifying the validity of this deSitter-tunneling picture. In the current paper, we extend these priorconsiderations to arbitrary-dimensional de Sitter space, as well asSchwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes. It is shown that the tunneling formalismnaturally censors against any black hole with a mass in excess of the Nariaivalue; thus enforcing a ``third law'' of Schwarzschild-de Sitterthermodynamics. We also provide commentary on the dS/CFT correspondence in thecontext of this tunneling framework.
