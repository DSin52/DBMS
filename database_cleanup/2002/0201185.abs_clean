We conjecture that the end point of bulk closed string tachyon decay at anynon-zero coupling, is the annihilation of space time by Witten's bubble ofnothing, resulting in a topological phase of the theory. In support of this wepresent a variety of situations in which there is a correspondence between theexistence of perturbative tachyons in one regime and the semi-classicalannihilation of space-time. Our discussion will include many recentlyinvestigated scenarios in string theory including Scherk-Schwarzcompactifications, Melvin magnetic backgrounds, and noncompact orbifolds. Weuse this conjecture to investigate a possible web of dualities relating theeleven-dimensional Fabinger-Horava background with nonsupersymmetric stringtheories. Along the way we point out where our conjecture resolves some of thepuzzles associated with bulk closed string tachyon condensation.
