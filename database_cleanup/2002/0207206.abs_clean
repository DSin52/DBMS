We analyze the scalar potentials of maximal gauged three-dimensionalsupergravities which reveal a surprisingly rich structure. In contrast tomaximal supergravities in dimensions D>3, all these theories admit a maximallysupersymmetric (N=16) ground state with negative cosmological constantLambda<0, except for the gauge group SO(4,4)^2, for which Lambda=0. We computethe mass spectra of bosonic and fermionic fluctuations around these vacua andidentify the unitary irreducible representations of the relevant background(super)isometry groups to which they belong. In addition, we find severalstationary points which are not maximally supersymmetric, and determine theircomplete mass spectra as well. In particular, we show that there are analogs ofall stationary points found in higher dimensions, among them de Sitter vacua inthe theories with noncompact gauge groups SO(5,3)^2 and SO(4,4)^2, as well asanti-de Sitter vacua in the compact gauged theory preserving 1/4 and 1/8 of thesupersymmetries. All the dS vacua have tachyonic instabilities, whereas theredo exist non-supersymmetric AdS vacua which are stable, again in contrast tothe D>3 theories.
