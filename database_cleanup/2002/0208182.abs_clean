Title: Virasoro Algebra for Particles with Higher Derivative Interactions

Authors: Pei-Ming Ho

Comments: 10 pages

In this paper we show that the worldline reparametrization for particles withhigher derivative interactions appears as a higher dimensional symmetry, whichis generated by the truncated Virasoro algebra. We also argue that for genericnonlocal particle theories the fields on the worldline may be promoted to thoseliving on a two dimensional worldsheet, and the reparametrization symmetrybecomes locally the same as the conformal symmetry.
