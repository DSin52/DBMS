We discuss the scalar cosmological perturbations in a 3-brane world with a 5Dbulk. We first show explicitly how the effective perturbed Einstein's equationson the brane (involving the Weyl fluid) are encoded into Mukohyama's masterequation. We give the relation between Mukohyama's master variable and theperturbations of the Weyl fluid, we also discuss the relation between theformer and the perturbations of matter and induced metric on the brane. We showthat one can obtain a boundary condition on the brane for the master equationsolely expressible in term of the master variable, in the case of a perfectfluid with adiabatic perturbations on a Randall-Sundrum (RS) orDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) brane. This provides an easy way to solvenumerically for the evolution of the perturbations as well as should shed lighton the various approximations done in the literature to deal with the Weyldegrees of freedom.
