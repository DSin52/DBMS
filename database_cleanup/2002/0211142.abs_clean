We refine the dictionary of the gauge/gravity correspondence realizing N=1super Yang-Mills by means of D5-branes wrapped on a resolved Calabi-Yau space.This is done by fixing an ambiguity on the correct interpretation of theholographic dual of the running gauge coupling and amounts to identify aspecific 2-cycle in the dual ten-dimensional supergravity background. In doingso, we also discuss the role played in this context by gauge transformations inthe relevant seven-dimensional gauged supergravity. While all nice propertiesof the duality are maintained, this modification of the dictionary has someinteresting physical consequences and solves a puzzle recently raised in theliterature. In this refined framework, it is also straightforward to see howthe correspondence naturally realizes a geometric transition.
