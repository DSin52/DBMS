Title: Non-commuting coordinates in vortex dynamics and in the Hall effect,

related to "exotic" Galilean symmetryComments: To appear in the proceedings of the International Workshop {\it

Italy), to be published by World Scientific. LaTex, 7 pages, no figuresVortex dynamics in a thin superfluid ${}^4$He film as well as in a type IIsuperconductor is described by the classical counterpart of the model advocatedby Peierls, and used for deriving the ground states of the Fractional QuantumHall Effect. The model has non-commuting coordinates, and is obtained byreduction from a particle associated with the ``exotic'' extension of theplanar Galilei group.
