We study the strong coupling dynamics of the heterotic E_8 x E_8 stringtheory on the orbifolds T^6/Z_3 and C^3/Z_3 using the duality with theHorava-Witten M-theory picture.This leads us to a conjecture about the low energy description of the fivedimensional E_0-theory (the CFT that describes the the singularity region ofM-theory on C^3/Z_3) compactified on S^1/Z_2.
