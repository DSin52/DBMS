added and typos correctedSupercritical string theories in D>10 dimensions with no moduli aredescribed, generalizing the asymmetric orientifold construction of one of theauthors. By taking the number of dimensions to be large and turning on fluxes,dilaton potentials are generated with nontrivial minima at arbitrarily smallcosmological constant and D-dimensional string coupling, separated by a barrierfrom a flat-space linear dilaton region, but possibly suffering from strongcoupling problems. The general issue of the decay of a de Sitter vacuum to flatspace is discussed. For relatively small barriers, such decays are described bygravitational instantons. It is shown that for a sufficiently large potentialbarrier, the bubble wall crosses the horizon. At the same time the instantondecay time exceeds the Poincare recurrence time. It is argued that theinclusion of such instantons is neither physically meaningful nor consistentwith basic principles such as causality. This raises the possibility that suchde Sitter vacua are effectively stable. In the case of the supercritical fluxmodels, decays to the linear dilaton region can be forbidden by such largebarriers, but decays to lower flux vacua including AdS minima neverthelessproceed consistently with this criterion. These models provide concreteexamples in which cosmological constant reduction by flux relaxation can beexplored.
