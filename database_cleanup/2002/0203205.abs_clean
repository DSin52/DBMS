We systematically study the question of identification and consistentinclusion of the radion, within the Lagrangian approach, in a two braneRandall-Sundrum model. Exploiting the symmetry properties of the theory, weshow how the radion can be identified unambiguously and give the action to allorders in the radion field and the metric. Using the background field method,we expand the theory to quadratic orders in the fields. We show that the mostgeneral classical solutions, for the induced metric on the branes in the caseof a constant radion and a factorizable 4D metric, correspond to Einsteinspaces. We discuss extensively the diagonalization of the quadratic action.Furthermore, we obtain the 4-dimensional effective theory from this and studythe question of the spectrum as well as the couplings in these theories.
