We investigate the low-energy dynamics of the BPS solitons of thenoncommutative CP^1 model in 2+1 dimensions using the moduli space metric ofthe BPS solitons. We show that the dynamics of a single soliton coincides withthat in the commutative model. We find that the singularity in the two-solitonmoduli space, which exists in the commutative CP^1 model, disappears in thenoncommutative model.We also show that the two-soliton metric has the smoothcommutative limit.
