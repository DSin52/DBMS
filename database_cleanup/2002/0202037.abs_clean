It is shown that a localized four-dimensional Einstein term, induced byquantum corrections, modifies significantly the law of gravity in aRandall-Sundrum brane world. In particular, the short-distance behavior ofgravity changes from five- to four-dimensional, while, depending on the valuesof parameters, there can be an intermediate range where gravity behaves as infive dimensions. The spectrum of graviton fluctuations around the brane, theirrelative importance for the gravitational force, and the relevance of theiremission in the bulk for the brane cosmology are analysed. Finally, constraintson parameters are derived from energy loss in astrophysical and particlephysics processes.
