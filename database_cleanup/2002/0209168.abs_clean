Title: Superconformal algebras and Lie superalgebras of the Hodge theory

Authors: Elena Poletaeva

Comments: 8 pages, LaTex. To be published in Journal of Nonlinear Mathematical

PhysicsWe observe a correspondence between the zero modes of superconformal algebras$S'(2, 1)$ and W(4) and the Lie superalgebras formed by classical operatorsappearing in the K{\"a}hler and hyper-K{\"a}hler geometry.
