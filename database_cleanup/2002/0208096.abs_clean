Title: Diluting Cosmological Constant via Large Distance Modification of

GravityAuthors: Gia Dvali, Gregory Gabadadze, M. Shifman

Comments: Latex, 15 pages, no figures. Based on talks given by the authors at

various recent conferencesWe review a solution of the cosmological constant problem in a brane-worldmodel with infinite-volume extra dimensions. The solution is based on anonlinear generally covariant theory of a metastable graviton that leads to alarge-distance modification of gravity.From the extra-dimensional standpoint the problem is solved due to the factthat the four-dimensional vacuum energy curves mostly the extra space. Thefour-dimensional curvature is small, being inversely proportional to a positivepower of the vacuum energy. The effects of infinite-volume extra dimensions areseen by a brane-world observer as nonlocal operators.From the four-dimensional perspective the problem is solved because thezero-mode graviton is extremely weakly coupled to localized four-dimensionalsources. The observable gravity is mediated not by zero mode but, instead, by ametastable graviton with a lifetime of the order of the present-day Hubblescale. Therefore, laws of gravity are modified in the infrared above the Hubblescale. Large wave-length sources, such as the vacuum energy, feel only thezero-mode interaction and, as a result, curve space very mildly. Shorterwave-length sources interact predominantly via exchange of the metastablegraviton. Because of this, all standard properties of early cosmology,including inflation, are intact.
