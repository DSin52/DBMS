In light of the recent work by Sen and Gibbons, we present a phase-planeanalysis on the cosmology containing a rolling tachyon field in a potentialresulted from string theory. We show that there is no stable point on thephase-plane, which indicated that there is a coincidence problem if oneconsider tachyon as a candidate of quintessence. Furthermore, we also analyzethe phase-plane of the cosmology containing a rolling tachyon field for anexactly solvable toy potential in which the critical point is stable.Therefore, it is possible for rolling tachyon to be quintessence if one give upthe strict constraint on the potential or find a more appropriate effectivepotential for the tachyon from M/string theory.
