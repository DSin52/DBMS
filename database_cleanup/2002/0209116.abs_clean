Title: Semiclassical quantization of superstrings

Comments: 29 pages, harvmac

We discuss semiclassical quantization of closed superstrings in AdS_5 x S^5.S^5 and folded string rotating in AdS_5. In the first case we clarify thegeneral structure of the sigma model perturbation theory for the energy ofstring states beyond the leading 1-loop order (related to the plane-wavelimit). In the second case we argue that the large spin limit of the expressionfor the ground-state energy (i.e. for the dimension of the correspondingminimal twist gauge theory operator) has the form S + f(\lambda) \ln S to allorders in \alpha' ~ \lambda^{-1/2} expansion, in agreement with the AdS/CFTduality. We also suggest an extension of the semiclassical approach tonear-conformal (near-AdS) cases on the example of the fractional D3-brane onconifold background.
