We describe the asymptotic boundary of the general homogeneous plane wavespacetime, using a construction of the `points at infinity' from the causalstructure of the spacetime as introduced by Geroch, Kronheimer and Penrose. Weshow that this construction agrees with the conformal boundary obtained byBerenstein and Nastase for the maximally supersymmetric ten-dimensional planewave. We see in detail how the possibility to go beyond (or around) infinityarises from the structure of light cones. We also discuss the extension of theconstruction to time-dependent plane wave solutions, focusing on the examplesobtained from the Penrose limit of Dp-branes.
