added, typos correctedWe consider the exact effective superpotential of N=1 U(N_c) super Yang-Millstheory with N_f massive flavors an additional adjoint Higgs field. We use theproposal of Dijkgraaf and Vafa to calculate the superpotential in terms of amatrix model with a large number of flavors. We do this by gauging the flavorsymmetry and forcing this sector in a classical vacuum. This gives rise to a2-matrix model of ADE type A_2, and large flavors. This approach allows us toadd an arbitrary polynomial tree level superpotential for the Higgs field, anduse strict large N methods in the matrix model.
