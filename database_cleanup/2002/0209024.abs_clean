Title: Discrete-Time Quantum Field Theory and the Deformed Super Virasoro

AlgebraAuthors: Masud Chaichian and Peter Presnajder

Comments: 3 pages, latex, no figures

We show that the deformations of Virasoro and super Virasoro algebra,constructed earlier on an abstract mathematical background, emerge after Wickrotation, within an exact treatment of discrete-time free field models on acircle. The deformation parameter is $e^\lambda$, where $\lambda=\tau/\rho$ isthe ratio of the discrete-time scale $\tau$ and the radius $\rho$ of thecompact space.
