We present a Lorentzian version of three-dimensional noncommutativeEinstein-AdS gravity by making use of the Chern-Simons formulation of puregravity in 2+1 dimensions. The deformed action contains a real, symmetricmetric and a real, antisymmetric tensor that vanishes in the commutative limit.These fields are coupled to two abelian gauge fields. We find that this theoryof gravity is invariant under a class of transformations that reduce tostandard diffeomorphisms once the noncommutativity parameter is set to zero.
