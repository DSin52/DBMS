We study the radiative corrections of the noncommutative QED at the one-looplevel. A correction of the magnetic dipole moment due to the noncommutativityare evaluated. As in the ordinary QED, IR divergence is shown to vanish when wecombine both the tree level Bremsstrahlung diagram and the one-loop electronvertex function.
