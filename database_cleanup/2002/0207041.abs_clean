chap. 3.3 as App. EWe quantise canonical free-field zero modes $p$, $q$ on a half-plane $p>0$both, for the Liouville field theory and its reduced Liouville particledynamics. We describe the particle dynamics in detail, calculate one-pointfunctions of particle vertex operators, deduce their zero mode realisation onthe half-plane, and prove that the particle vertex operators act self-adjointlyon a Hilbert space $L^2(\rr_+)$ on account of symmetries generated by the$S$-matrix. Similarly, self-adjointness of the corresponding vertex operator ofLiouville field theory in the zero mode sector is obtained by applying theLiouville reflection amplitude, which is derived by the operator method.
