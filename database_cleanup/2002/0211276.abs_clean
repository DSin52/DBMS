Recent results on zero modes of the Abelian Dirac operator in threedimensions support to some degree the conjecture that the Chern-Simons actionadmits only certain quantized values for gauge fields that lead to zero modesof the corresponding Dirac operator. Here we show that this conjecture is wrongby constructing an explicit counter-example.
