We investigate here a supermatrix model with a mass term and a cubicinteraction. It is based on the super Lie algebra osp(1|32,R), which could playa role in the construction of the eleven-dimensional M-theory. This modelcontains a massive version of the IIB matrix model, where some fields have atachyonic mass term. Therefore, the trivial vacuum of this theory is unstable.However, this model possesses several classical solutions where these fieldsbuild noncommutative curved spaces and these solutions are shown to beenergetically more favorable than the trivial vacuum. In particular, wedescribe in details two cases, the SO(3) \times SO(3) \times SO(3) (three fuzzy2-spheres) and the SO(9) (fuzzy 8-sphere) classical backgrounds.
