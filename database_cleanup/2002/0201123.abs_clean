An analysis of CPN models is given in terms of general coordinates orarbitrary interpolating fields.Only closed expressions made from simplefunctions are involved.Special attention is given to CP2 and CP4. In the firstof these the retrieval of stereographic coordinates reveals the hermitian formof the metric. A similar analysis for the latter case allows comparison withthe Fubini-Study metric.
