We consider strings with large spin in AdS_3xS^3xM with NS-NS background. Weconstruct the string configurations as solutions of SL(2,R) WZW theory. Wecompute the relation between the space-time energy and spin, and show that theanomalous correction is constant, and not logarithmic in the spin. This is incontrast to the S-dual background with R-R charge where the anomalouscorrection is logarithmic.
