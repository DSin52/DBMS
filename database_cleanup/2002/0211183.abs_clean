Title: Quantum Discontinuity for Massive Spin 3/2 with a Lambda Term

Authors: M. J. Duff, James T. Liu and H. Sati

We show that the recently demonstrated absence of the vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity for massive spin 3/2 with a Lambda term isan artifact of the tree level approximation, and that the discontinuityreappears at one loop. As a numerical check on the calculation, we rederive thevanishing of the one- loop beta function for D=11 supergravity on AdS_4 x S^7level-by-level in the Kaluza-Klein tower.
