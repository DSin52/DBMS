generalized regularizationAuthors: Anisur Rahaman

Comments: 13 pages latex file

Nonconfining Schwinger Model [AR] is studied with a one parameter class ofkinetic energy like regularization. It may be thought of as a generalizationover the regularization considered in [AR]. Phasespace structure has beendetermined in this new situation. The mass of the gauge boson acquires ageneralized expression with the bare coupling constant and the parametersinvolved in the regularization. Deconfinement scenario has become transparentat the quark-antiquark potential level.
