New and rather controversial observations hint that the fine structureconstant \alpha may have been smaller in the early universe, suggesting thatsome of the fundamental ``constants'' of physics may be dynamical. In a recentpaper, Davies, Davis, and Lineweaver have argued that black hole thermodynamicsfavors theories in which the speed of light c decreases with time, anddisfavors those in which the fundamental electric charge e increases. We showthat when one considers the full thermal environment of a black hole, no such\alpha whether it comes from a decrease in c, an increase in e, or acombination of the two.
