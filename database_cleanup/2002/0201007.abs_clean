The Landau problem is discussed in two similar but still differentnon-commutative frameworks. The ``standard'' one, where the coupling to thegauge field is achieved using Poisson brackets, yields all Landau levels. The``exotic'' approach, where the coupling to the gauge field is achieved usingthe symplectic structure, only yields lowest-Landau level states, as advocatedby Peierls and used in the description of the ground states of the FractionalQuantum Hall Effect. The same reduced model also describes vortex dynamics in asuperfluid ${}^4$He film. Remarkably, the spectrum depends crucially on thequantization scheme. The system is symmetric w. r. t. area-preservingdiffeomorphisms.
