Title: Not a prescription but an identity

Authors: Ricardo Bentin

Comments: 21 pages

After some considerations and coincidences that appear when working in thelight-cone gauge, in both the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription and thecovariantization method, we suspect that there must be some connection betweenthem. This work shows that we were right and it is practically trivial todemonstrate that relationship. And since the covariantization method is not aprescription, this implies that the results of Mandelstam and Leibbrandt arenot prescriptions too, but they are a identities from light-cone gaugecoordinates.
