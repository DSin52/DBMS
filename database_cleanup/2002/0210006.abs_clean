2002 Workshop on Varying Fundamental Constants, Porto, September 2002. To bepublished in the Conference ProceedingsAn analysis of a spherically symmetric braneworld configuration is performedwhen the intrinsic curvature scalar is included in the bulk action. In the casewhen the electric part of the Weyl tensor is zero, all the exterior solutionsare found; one of them is of the Schwarzschild-(A)dS(4) form, which is matchedto a modified Oppenheimer-Volkoff interior solution. In the case when theelectric part of the Weyl tensor is non zero, the exteriorSchwarzschild-(A)dS(4) black hole solution is modified receiving correctionsfrom the non-local bulk effects. A non-universal gravitational constant arises,depending on the density of the considered object and the Newton's law ismodified for small and large distances; however, the conventional limits areeasily obtained.
