We generalize the results of hep-th/0008140 to the case of the(n+1)-dimensional closed FRW universe satisfying a general equation of state ofthe form p=w\rho. We find that the entropy of the universe can no longer beexpressed in a form similar to the Cardy formula, when w\neq 1/n. As a result,in general the entropy formula does not coincide with the Friedmann equationwhen the conjectured bound on the Casimir energy is saturated. Furthermore, theconjectured bound on the Casimir energy generally does not lead to the Hubbleand the Bekenstein entropy bounds.
