Title: Comment on "A new, exact, gauge-invariant RG-flow equation"

Authors: Filipe Paccetti Correia

We show that the exact RG-flow equation introduced recently in hep-th/0207134can be obtained in the sharp cut-off limit of the well-known ERGE. This can beexpected from the fact that in this limit the new scale-dependent effectiveaction coincides with the one which is usually considered.
