We define a class of orthosymplectic $osp(m;j|2n;\omega)$ and unitary$sl(m;j|n;\epsilon)$ superalgebras which may be obtained from $osp(m|2n)$ and$sl(m|n)$ by contractions and analytic continuations in a similar way as thespecial linear, orthogonal and the symplectic Cayley-Klein algebras areobtained from the corresponding classical ones. Casimir operators ofCayley-Klein superalgebras are obtained from the corresponding operators of thebasic superalgebras. Contractions of $sl(2|1)$ and $osp(3|2)$ are regarded asan examples.
