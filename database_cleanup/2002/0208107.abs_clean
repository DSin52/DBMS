We classify and construct all the smooth Kaluza-Klein reductions to tendimensions of the M2- and M5-brane configurations which preserve some of thesupersymmetry. In this way we obtain a wealth of new supersymmetric IIAbackgrounds describing composite configurations of D-branes, NS-branes andflux/nullbranes; bound states of D2-branes and strings, D4-branes andNS5-branes, as well as some novel configurations in which the quotient involvesnowhere-vanishing transverse rotations to the brane twisted by a timelike orlightlike translation. From these results there also follow novel M-theorybackgrounds locally isometric to the M-branes, some of which are time-dependentand all of which are asymptotic to discrete quotients of eleven-dimensionalMinkowski spacetime. We emphasise the universality of the formalism by brieflydiscussing analogous analyses in type IIA/IIB dual to the ones mentioned above.Some comments on the dual gauge theory description of some of ourconfigurations are also included.
