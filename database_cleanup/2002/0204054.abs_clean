We find half supersymmetric AdS-embeddings in AdS_5 x S^5 corresponding toall quarter BPS orthogonal intersections of D3-branes with Dp-branes. Aparticular case is the Karch-Randall embedding AdS_4 x S^2. We explicitly provethat these embeddings are supersymmetric by showing that the kappa symmetryprojections are compatible with half of the target space Killing spinors andargue that all these cases lead to AdS/dCFT dualities involving a CFT with adefect. We also find an asymptotically AdS_4 x S^2 embedding that correspondsto a holographic RG-flow on the defect. We then consider the pp-wave limit ofthe supersymmetric AdS-embeddings and show how it leads to half supersymmetricD-brane embeddings in the pp-wave background. We systematically analyze D-braneembeddings in the pp-wave background along with their supersymmetry. Weconstruct all supersymmetric D-branes wrapped along the light-cone usingusing defect fields. We also find supersymmetric D1 (monopoles) and D3 (giantgravitons) branes that wrap only one of the light-cone directions. Thesecorrespond to non-perturbative states in the dual gauge theory.
