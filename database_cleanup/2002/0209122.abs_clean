Title: Time and Tachyon

Comments: LaTeX file, 24 pages

Recent analysis suggests that the classical dynamics of a tachyon on anunstable D-brane is described by a scalar Born-Infeld type action with arunaway potential. The classical configurations in this theory at late time arein one to one correspondence with the configuration of a system ofnon-interacting (incoherent), non-rotating dust. We discuss some aspects ofcanonical quantization of this field theory coupled to gravity, and explore,following earlier work on this subject, the possibility of using the scalarfield (tachyon) as the definition of time in quantum cosmology. At late `time'we can identify a subsector in which the scalar field decouples from gravityand we recover the usual Wheeler - de Witt equation of quantum gravity.
