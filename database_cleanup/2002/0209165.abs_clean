Praha-Spin-02, Praha, Czech Republic, July 14-27, 2002A new Einstein-Hilbert type (SGM) action describing gravitational interactionof Nambu-Goldstone(N-G) fermion of nonlinear supersymmetry(NL SUSY) is obtainedby performing the Einstein gravity analogue geometrical arguments in highsymmetric four dimensional (SGM) spacetime. All elementary particles exceptgraviton are regarded as the composite eigenstates of SO(10) super-Poincar\'ealgebra(SPA) composed of the fundamental N-G fermion ``superons'' of NL SUSY.Some phenomenological implications of the composite picture of SGM, thelinearlization of SGM and N = 2 Volkov-Akulov model are discussed.
