Title: Searching for a Connection Between Matroid Theory and String Theory

Authors: J. A. Nieto

Comments: 25 pages, Latex

We make a number of observations about matter-ghost string phase, which mayeventually lead to a formal connection between matroid theory and stringtheory. In particular, in order to take advantage of the already establishedconnection between matroid theory and Chern-Simons theory, we propose ageneralization of string theory in terms of some kind of Kahler metric. We showthat this generalization is closely related to the Kahler-Chern-Simons actiondue to Nair and Schiff. We also add new information about the relationshipbetween matroid theory, D=11 supergravity and Chern-Simons formalism.
