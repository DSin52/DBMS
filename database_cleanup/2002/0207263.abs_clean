We consider six dimensional brane world models with a compact and a warpedextra dimension with five dimensional branes. We find that such scenarios havemany interesting features arising from both ADD and Randall-Sundrum -models. Inparticular we study a class of models with a single 5D brane and a finitewarped extra dimension, where one of the brane dimensions is compact. In thesemodels the hierarchy problem can be solved on a single positive tension brane.
