Authors: E.T.Akhmedov, (ITEP)

Comments: Latex, 8p

It is shown that the Holographic Renormalization Group can be formulateduniversally within Quantum Field Theory as (the quantization of) theHamiltonian flow on the cotangent bundle to the space of gauge-invariantsingle-trace operators supplied with the canonical symplectic structure. Theclassical Hamiltonian dynamics is recovered in the large $N$ limit.
