The Hopf algebra of renormalisation in quantum field theory is described at ageneral level. The products of fields at a point are assumed to form abialgebra B and renormalisation endows T(T(B)^+), the double tensor algebra ofB, with the structure of a noncommutative bialgebra. When the bialgebra B iscommutative, renormalisation turns S(S(B)^+), the double symmetric algebra ofB, into a commutative bialgebra. The usual Hopf algebra of renormalisation isrecovered when the elements of $T^1(B)$ are not renormalised, i.e. when Feynmandiagrams containing one single vertex are not renormalised. When B is the Hopfalgebra of a commutative group, a homomorphism is established between thebialgebra S(S(B)^+) and the Faa di Bruno bialgebra of composition of series.The relation with the Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms isgiven. Finally, the bialgebra S(S(B)^+) is shown to give the same results asthe standard renormalisation procedure for the scalar field.
