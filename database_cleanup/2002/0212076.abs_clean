Authors: B J Schroers

Solitons and Duality, Sao Paulo, July 2002Well-separated Skyrme solitons of arbitrary degree attract after a suitablerelative rotation in space and iso-space, provided the orders of the solitons'leading multipoles do not differ by more than two. I summarise the derivationof this result, obtained jointly with Manton and Singer, and discuss to whatextent its combination with earlier results of Esteban allows one to deduce theexistence of minima of the Skyrme energy functional.
