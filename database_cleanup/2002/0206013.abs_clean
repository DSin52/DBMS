The mapping of topologically nontrivial gauge transformations innoncommutative gauge theory to corresponding commutative ones is investigatedvia the operator form of the Seiberg-Witten map. The role of the gaugetransformation part of the map is analyzed. Chern-Simons actions are examinedand the correspondence to their commutative counterparts is clarified.
