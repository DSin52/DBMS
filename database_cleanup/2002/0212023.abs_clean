Using a fixed-energy amplitude in Randall-Sundrum single brane scenario, wecompute the Newton potential on the brane. It is shown that the correctionterms to the Newton potential involve a logarithmic factor. Especially, whenthe distance between two point masses are very small compared to $AdS$ radius,the contribution of KK spectrum becomes dominant compared to the usualinversely square law. This fact may be used to prove the existence of an extradimension experimentally.
