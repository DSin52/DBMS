The metric of a spacetime with a parallel plane (pp)-wave can be obtained ina certain limit of the space AdS^5xS^5. According to the AdS/CFTcorrespondence, the holographic dual of superstring theory on that backgroundshould be the analogous limit of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In thispaper we shall show that, contrary to widespread expectation, non-planardiagrams survive this limiting procedure in the gauge theory. Using matrixmodel techniques as well as combinatorial reasoning it is demonstrated that asubset of diagrams of arbitrary genus survives and that a non-trivial doublescaling limit may be defined. We exactly compute two- and three-point functionsof chiral primaries in this limit. We also carefully study certain operatorsconjectured to correspond to string excitations on the pp-wave background. Wefind non-planar linear mixing of these proposed operators, requiring theirredefinition. Finally, we show that the redefined operators receive non-planarcorrections to the planar one-loop anomalous dimension.
