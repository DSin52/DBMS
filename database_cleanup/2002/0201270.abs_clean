We determine, in the context of five-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ gaugedsupergravity with vector and hypermultiplets, the conditions under which curved(non Ricci flat) supersymmetric domain wall solutions may exist. These curvedBPS domain wall solutions may, in general, be supported by non-constant vectorand hyper scalar fields. We establish our results by a careful analysis of theBPS equations as well as of the associated integrability conditions and theequations of motion. We construct an example of a curved BPS solution in agauged supergravity model with one hypermultiplet. We also discuss the dualdescription of curved BPS domain walls in terms of RG flows.
