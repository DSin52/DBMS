Eq. (B9) was corrected and some additional references addedThe nonequilibrium dynamics of coupled quantum oscillators subject todifferent time dependent quenches are analyzed in the context of theLiouville-von Neumann approach. We have studied models of quantum oscillatorsin interaction that are exactly soluble in the cases of both sudden and smoothquenches. We have determined the explicit time evolution of number densitiesamong other quantities, like the final equilibration temperature for theproblem of a quantum oscillator coupled to an infinity set of otheroscillators. The connection to quantum fields is briefly discussed.
