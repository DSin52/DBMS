Title: On the energy-momentum tensor in non-commutative gauge theories

Authors: Ashok Das and J. Frenkel

Comments: 3 pages

We study the properties of the energy-momentum tensor in non-commutativegauge theories by coupling them to a weak external gravitational field. Inparticular, we show that the stress tensor of such a theory coincides exactlywith that derived from a theory where a Seiberg-Witten map has been implemented(namely, the procedure is commutative). Various other interesting features arealso discussed.
