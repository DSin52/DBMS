In hep-th/0211011 we started a systematic investigation of open strings inthe plane wave background. In this paper we continue the analysis by discussingthe superalgebras of conserved charges, the spectra of open strings, and thespectra of DBI fluctuations around D-brane embeddings. We also derive thegluing conditions for corresponding boundary states and analyze theirsymmetries. All results are consistent with each other, and confirm theexistence of additional supersymmetries as previously discussed. We furthershow that for every symmetry current one can construct a (countably) infinitenumber of related currents that contain more worldsheet derivatives, anddiscuss non-local symmetries.
