clarified, Appendix D and some material from Section 5 removedThe joining--splitting interaction of non-critical bosonic string is analyzedin the light-cone formulation. The Mandelstam method of constructing treestring amplitudes is extended to the bosonic massive string models of thediscrete series. The general properties of the Liouville longitudinalexcitations which are necessary and sufficient for the Lorentz covariance ofthe light-cone amplitudes are derived. The results suggest that the covariantand the light-cone approach are equivalent also in the non-critical dimensions.Some aspects of unitarity of interacting non-critical massive string theory arediscussed.
