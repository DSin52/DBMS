We show how massive/gauged maximal supergravities in 11-n dimensions withSO(n-l,l) gauge groups (and other non-semisimple subgroups of Sl(n,R)) can besystematically obtained by dimensional reduction of ``massive 11-dimensionalsupergravity''. This series of massive/gauged supergravities includes, forinstance, Romans' massive N=2A,d=10 supergravity for n=1, N=2,d=9 SO(2) andSO(1,1) gauged supergravities for n=2, and N=8,d=5 SO(6-l,l) gaugedsupergravity. In all cases, higher p-form fields get masses through theStuckelberg mechanism which is an alternative to self-duality in odddimensions.
