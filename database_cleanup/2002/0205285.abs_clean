Title: Vanishing index for supersymmetric 2-matrix model with odd dimensional

gauge groupAuthors: G. M. Graf, D. Hasler, J. Hoppe

We define an operator which for odd-dimensional compact gauge group furnishesunitary equivalence of the bosonic and fermionic sector in the supersymmetricquantum-mechanical matrix model obtained by dimensional reduction from3-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
