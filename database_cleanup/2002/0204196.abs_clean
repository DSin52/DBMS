Exploiting insights on strings moving in pp-wave backgrounds, we show howopen strings emerge from N = 4 SU(M) Yang-Mills theory as fluctuations aroundcertain states carrying R-charge of order M. These states are dual to sphericalD3-branes of AdS_5 x S^5 and we reproduce the spectrum of small fluctuations ofthese states from Yang Mills theory. When G such D3-branes coincide, theexpected G^2 light degrees of freedom emerge. The open strings running betweenthe branes can be quantized easily in a Penrose limit of the spacetime. Takingthe corresponding large charge limit of the Yang-Mills theory, we reproduce theopen string worldsheets and their spectra from field theory degrees of freedom.
