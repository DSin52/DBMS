Title: N=8 Supergravity in Central Charge Superspace

Authors: Annamaria Kiss and Emmanuel Loyer

We present a new geometrical description of N=8 supergravity, using centralcharge superspace. The essential properties of the multiplet, like self-dualityproperties of the vectors or the non-linear sigma model structure of thescalars, appear in a natural way in this formulation. We also present in detailhow to deduce from this geometrical formulation the supergravitytransformations as well as the equations of motion for the component fields inorder to compare them with the results already known and obtained informulations on the component level.
