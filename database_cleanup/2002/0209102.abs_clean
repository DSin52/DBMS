We extend the Bardakci-Thorn (BT) worldsheet formalism to supersymmetricnon-abelian gauge theory. Our method covers the cases of N =1,2,4 extendedsupersymmetry. This task requires the introduction of spinor valued Grassmannvariables on the worldsheet analogous to those of the supersymmetricformulation of superstring theory. As in the pure Yang-Mills case, theworldsheet formalism automatically generates the correct quartic vertices fromthe cubic vertices. We also discuss coupling renormalization to one loop order.
