We consider the associativity or Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV)equations and discuss one of the most relevant for non-perturbative physicsclass of their solutions based on existence of the residue formulas. It isdemonstrated for this case that the proof of associativity equations is reducedto the problem of solving system of algebraic linear equations. The particularexamples of solutions related to Landau-Ginzburg topological theories,Seiberg-Witten theories and tau-functions of quasiclassical hierarchies arediscussed in detail. We also discuss related questions including covariance ofassociativity equations, their relation to dispersionless Hirota relations andauxiliary linear problem for the WDVV equations.
