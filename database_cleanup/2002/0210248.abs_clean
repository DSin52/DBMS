Title: Two AdS2 branes in the Euclidean AdS3

Authors: S. Ribault (CPHT, Ecole Polytechnique)

Comments: 5 pages, no figures

We compute the density of open strings stretching between AdS2 branes in theEuclidean AdS3. This is done by solving the factorization constraint of adegenerate boundary field, and the result is checked by a Cardy-typecomputation. We mention applications to branes in the Minkowskian AdS3 and itscigar coset.
