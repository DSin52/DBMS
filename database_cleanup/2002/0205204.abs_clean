We consider supergravity solutions of D5 branes wrapped on supersymmetric2-cycles and use them to discuss relevant features of four-dimensional N=1 andN=2 super Yang-Mills theories with gauge group SU(n). In particular in the N=1case, using a gravitational dual of the gaugino condensate, we obtain thecomplete NSVZ beta-function. We also find non-perturbative correctionsassociated to fractional instantons with charge 2/n. These non-perturbativeeffects modify the running of the coupling constant which remains finite evenat small scales in a way that resembles to the soft confinement scenario ofQCD.
