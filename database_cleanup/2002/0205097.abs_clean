Recently, Maldacena, Moore and Seiberg introduced non-maximally symmetricboundary states on group manifold using T-duality. In the work presented herewe suggest simple description of these branes in terms of group elements. Weshow that T-dualization actually reduces to multiplication of conjugacy classesby the corresponding U(1) subgroups. Using this description we find thetwo-form trivializing the WZW three-form on the branes. SU(2) and $SL(2,R)$examples are considered in details.
