corrected, contribution to the Proceedings of the First Mexican Meeting onMathematical and Experimental Physics, Mexico CityWe survey geometric quantization of finite dimensional affine Kahlermanifolds. Its corresponding prequantization and the Berezin's deformationquantization formulation, as proposed by Cahen et al., is used to quantizetheir corresponding Kahler quotients. Equivariant formalism greatly facilitatesthe description.
