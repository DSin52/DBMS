We discuss Coleman's theorem concerning the energy density of the groundstate of the sine-Gordon model proved in Phys. Rev. D 11, 2088 (1975).According to this theorem the energy density of the ground state of thesine-Gordon model should be unbounded from below for coupling constants beta^2> 8 pi. The consequence of this theorem would be the non-existence of thequantum ground state of the sine-Gordon model for beta^2 > 8 pi. We show thatthe energy density of the ground state in the sine-Gordon model is bounded frombelow even for beta^2 > 8 pi.
