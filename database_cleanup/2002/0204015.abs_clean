We discuss some of the key topological aspects of a two $(1+1)$-dimensional(2D) self-interacting non-Abelian gauge theory (having no interaction withmatter fields) in the framework of {\it chiral} superfield formalism. Weprovide the geometrical interpretation for the Lagrangian density, symmetricenergy momentum tensor, topological invariants, etc., by exploiting the {\iton-shell} nilpotent BRST- and co-BRST symmetries that emerge after theapplication of (dual) horizontality conditions. We show that the abovephysically interesting quantities geometrically correspond to the translationof some local (but composite) {\it chiral} superfields along one of the twoindependent Grassmannian directions of a four ($2+2)$-dimensionalsupermanifold. This translation is generated by the conserved and on-shellnilpotent (co-)BRST charges that are present in the theory.
