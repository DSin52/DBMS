When phase space coordinates are noncommutative, especially includingarbitrarily noncommutative momenta, the Hall effect is reinvestigated. Aminimally gauge-invariant coupling of electromagnetic field is introduced bymaking use of Faddeev-Jackiw formulation for unconstrained and constrainedsystems. We find that the parameter of noncommutative momenta makes animportant contribution to the Hall conductivity.
