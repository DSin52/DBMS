We review various attempts to localize the discrete spectra ofsemirelativistic Hamiltonians of the form H = \beta \sqrt{m^2 + p^2} + V(r)(w.l.o.g. in three spatial dimensions) as entering, for instance, in thespinless Salpeter equation. Every Hamiltonian in this class of operatorsconsists of the relativistic kinetic energy \beta \sqrt{m^2 + p^2} (where \beta> 0 allows for the possibility of more than one particles of mass m) and aspherically symmetric attractive potential V(r), r = |x|. In general, accurateeigenvalues of a nonlocal Hamiltonian operator can only be found by the use ofa numerical approximation procedure. Our main emphasis, however, is on thederivation of rigorous semi-analytical expressions for both upper and lowerbounds to the energy levels of such operators. We compare the bounds obtainedwithin different approaches and present relationships existing between thebounds.
