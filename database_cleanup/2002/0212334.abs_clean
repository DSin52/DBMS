Title: Varying Fine Structure Constant and Black Hole Physics

Recent astrophysical observations suggest that the fine structure constant$\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$ may be slowly increasing with time. This may be due to anincrease of $e$ or a decrease of $c$, or both. In this article, we argue frommodel independent considerations that this variation should be consideredadiabatic. Then, we examine in detail the consequences of such an adiabaticvariation in the context of a specific model of quantized charged black holes.We find that the second law of black hole thermodynamics is obeyed, regardlessof the origin of the variation, and that interesting constraints arise on thecharge and mass of black holes. Finally, we estimate the work done on a blackhole of mass $M$ due to the $\alpha$ variation.
