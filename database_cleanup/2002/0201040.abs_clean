We present a new scenario for baryogenesis in the context of heteroticbrane-world models. The baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated at asmall-instanton phase transition which is initiated by a moving brane collidingwith the observable boundary. We demonstrate, in the context of a simple model,that reasonable values for the baryon asymmetry can be obtained. As a byproductwe find a new class of moving-brane cosmological solutions in the presence of aperfect fluid.
