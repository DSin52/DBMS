We investigate the asymptotic dynamics of topological anti-de Sittersupergravity in two dimensions. Starting from the formulation as a BF theory,it is shown that the AdS_2 boundary conditions imply that the asymptoticsymmetries form a super-Virasoro algebra. Using the central charge of thisalgebra in Cardy's formula, we exactly reproduce the thermodynamical entropy ofAdS_2 black holes. Furthermore, we show that the dynamics of the dilaton andits superpartner reduces to that of superconformal transformations that leaveinvariant one chiral component of the stress tensor supercurrent of atwo-dimensional conformal field theory. This dynamics is governed by asupersymmetric extension of the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model of conformalquantum mechanics. Finally, two-dimensional de Sitter gravity is alsoconsidered, and the dS_2 entropy is computed by counting CFT states.
