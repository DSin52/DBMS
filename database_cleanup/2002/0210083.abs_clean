Phenomenology in Oxford, Strings 2002 and 35th Ahrenshoop Symposium. 36We describe the general geometrical framework of brane world constructions inorientifolds of type IIA string theory with D6-branes wrapping 3-cycles in aCalabi-Yau 3-fold, and point out their immediate phenomenological relevance.These branes generically intersect in points, and the patterns of intersectionsgovern the chiral fermion spectra and issues of gauge and supersymmetrybreaking in the low energy effective gauge theory on their world volume. Inparticular, we provide an example of an intersecting brane world scenario onthe quintic Calabi-Yau with the gauge group and the chiral spectrum of theStandard Model and discuss its properties in some detail. Additionally weexplain related technical advancements in the construction of supersymmetricorientifold vacua with intersecting D-branes. Six-dimensional orientifolds ofthis type generalize the rather limited set of formerly known orbifolds of typeI, and the presented techniques provide a short-cut to obtain their spectra.Finally, we comment on lifting configurations of intersecting D6-branes toM-theory on non-compact G_2 manifolds.
