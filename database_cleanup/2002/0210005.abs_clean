Braneworld effective action is constructed by two different methods basedrespectively on the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems. Theequivalence of these methods is shown due to nontrivial duality relationsbetween special boundary operators of these two problems. Previously knownbraneworld action algorithms in two-brane Randall-Sundrum model are generalizedto curved branes with deSitter and Anti-deSitter geometries.
