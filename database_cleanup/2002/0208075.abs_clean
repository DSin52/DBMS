Title: Tachyonic Instability and Darboux Transformation

Authors: A.V. Yurov

Comments: 9 pages

Using Darboux transformation one can construct infinite family of potentialswhich lead to the flat spectrum of scalar field fluctuations with arbitrarymultiple precision, and, at the same time, with "essentially blue" spectrum ofclassical potential V(phi) starting from the known "one-loop potential" u(t) =d^2V(phi(t))/d phi(t)^2.
