We calculate the full 1-loop corrections to the low energy coupling of bulkgauge boson in a slice of AdS5 which are induced by generic 5-dimensionalscalar, Dirac fermion, and vector fields with arbitrary Z_2 times Z_2' orbifoldboundary conditions. In supersymmetric limit, our results correctly reproducethe results obtained by an independent method based on 4-dimensional effectivesupergravity. This provides a nontrivial check of our results and assures theregularization scheme-independence of the results.
