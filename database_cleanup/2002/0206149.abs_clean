As a simple model for unknown Planck scale physics, we assume that thequantum modes responsible for producing primordial curvature perturbationsduring inflation are placed in their instantaneous adiabatic vacuum when theirproper momentum reaches a fixed high energy scale M. The resulting powerspectrum is derived and presented in a form that exhibits the amplitude andfrequency of the superimposed oscillations in terms of H/M and the slow rollparameter epsilon. The amplitude of the oscillations is proportional to thethird power of H/M. We argue that these small oscillations give the lower boundof the modifications of the power spectrum if the notion of free modepropagation ceases to exist above the critical energy scale M.
