repairedWe show that noncommutative gauge theory in two dimensions is an exactlysolvable model. A cohomological formulation of gauge theory defined on thenoncommutative torus is used to show that its quantum partition function can bewritten as a sum over contributions from classical solutions. We derive anexplicit formula for the partition function of Yang-Mills theory defined on aprojective module for arbitrary noncommutativity parameter \theta which ismanifestly invariant under gauge Morita equivalence. The energy observables areshown to be smooth functions of \theta. The construction of noncommutativeinstanton contributions to the path integral is described in some detail. Ingeneral, there are infinitely many gauge inequivalent contributions of fixedtopological charge, along with a finite number of quantum fluctuations abouteach instanton. The associated moduli spaces are combinations of symmetricproducts of an ordinary two-torus whose orbifold singularities are not resolvedby noncommutativity. In particular, the weak coupling limit of the gauge theoryis independent of \theta and computes the symplectic volume of the moduli spaceof constant curvature connections on the noncommutative torus.
