In this article, we study how the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves canbe used to describe D-branes. We show how global bound state construction intopological $K$-theory can be adapted to our context, showing that D-braneswrapping a subvariety are holomorphically classified by a relative $K$-group.By taking the duality between the relative $K$-groups and the $K$-homologies,we show that D-brane charge of type IIB superstrings is properly classified bythe $K$-homology.
