We evaluate various disk level four-point functions involving the masslessscalar and tachyon vertex operators in the presence of background B-flux insuperstring theory. By studying these amplitudes in specific limits, we findcouplings of two scalars with two tachyons, and couplings of four tachyons onthe world-volume of non-BPS D-branes of superstring theory. They are fullyconsistent with the non-commutative tachyonic Dirac-Born-Infeld effectiveaction. They also fix the coefficient of T^4 term in the expansion of thetachyon potential around its maximum.
