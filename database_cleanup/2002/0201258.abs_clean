We argue that multi-trace deformations of the boundary CFT in AdS/CFTcorrespondence can arise through the OPE of single-trace operators. We work outthe example of a scalar field in AdS_5 with cubic self interaction. By anappropriate reparametrization of the boundary data we are able to deform theboundary CFT by a marginal operator that couples to the conformal anomaly. Ourmethod can be used in the analysis of multi-trace deformations in N=4 SYM wherethe OPEs of various single-trace operators are known.
