We present unified ways of handling the cosmological perturbations in a classof gravity theory covered by a general action in eq. (1). This gravity includesour previous generalized $f(\phi,R)$ gravity and the gravity theory motivatedby the tachyonic condensation. We present general prescription to derive thepower spectra generated from vacuum quantum fluctuations in the slow-rollinflation era. An application is made to a slow-roll inflation based on thetachyonic condensation with an exponential potential.
