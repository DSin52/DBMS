Title: Inflation, Quantum Cosmology and the Anthropic Principle

Authors: Andrei Linde

Comments: 35 pages, 2 figs., to appear in "Science and Ultimate Reality

Quantum to Cosmos", honoring John Wheeler's 90th birthday. J. D. Barrow,P.C.W. Davies, & C.L. Harper eds. Cambridge University Press (2003)Anthropic principle can help us to understand many properties of our world.However, for a long time this principle seemed too metaphysical and manyscientists were ashamed to use it in their research. I describe here ajustification of the weak anthropic principle in the context of inflationarycosmology and suggest a possible way to justify the strong anthropic principleusing the concept of the multiverse.
