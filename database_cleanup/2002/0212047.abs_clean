Thermodynamics of 5d SdS black hole is considered. Thermal fluctuationsdefine the (sub-dominant) logarithmic corrections to black hole entropy andthen to Cardy-Verlinde formula and to FRW brane cosmology. We demonstrate thatlogarithmic terms (which play the role of effective cosmological constant)change the behavior of 4d spherical brane in dS, SdS or Nariai bulk. Inparticularly, bounce Universe occurs or 4d dS brane expands to its maximum andthen shrinks. The entropy bounds are also modified by next-to-leading terms.Out of braneworld context the logarithmic terms may suggest slight modificationof standard FRW cosmology.
