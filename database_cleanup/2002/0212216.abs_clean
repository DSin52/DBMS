We investigate the scalar potential of gauged N=4 supergravity with matter.The extremum in the SU(1,1)/U(1) scalars is obtained for an arbitrary number ofmatter multiplets. The constraints on the matter scalars are solved in terms ofan explicit parametrisation of anSO(6,6+n) element. For the case of six matter multiplets we discuss bothcompact and noncompact gauge groups.In an example involving noncompact groups and four scalars we find a potentialwith an absolute minimum and a positive cosmological constant.
