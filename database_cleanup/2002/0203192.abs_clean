SystemsWe present the Lax pair for the field elliptic Calogero-Moser system andestablish a connection between this system and the Kadomtsev-Petviashviliequation. Namely, we consider elliptic families of solutions of the KPequation, such that their poles satisfy a constraint of being balanced. We showthat the dynamics of these poles is described by a reduction of the fieldelliptic CM system.We construct a wide class of solutions to the field elliptic CM system byshowing that any N-fold branched cover of an elliptic curve gives rise to anelliptic family of solutions of the KP equation with balanced poles.
