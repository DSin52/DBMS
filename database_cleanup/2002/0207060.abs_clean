The consequences for the brane cosmological evolution of energy exchangebetween the brane and the bulk are analysed in detail, in the context of anon-factorizable background geometry with vanishing effective cosmologicalconstant on the brane. A rich variety of brane cosmologies is obtained,depending on the precise mechanism of energy transfer, the equation of state ofbrane-matter and the spatial topology. An accelerating era is generically afeature of our solutions. In the case of low-density flat universe more darkmatter than in the conventional FRW picture is predicted. Spatially compactsolutions are found to delay their recollapse.
