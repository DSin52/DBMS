We study spherically and axially symmetric monopoles of the SU(2)Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs-dilaton (EYMHD) system with a new coupling betweenthe dilaton field and the covariant derivative of the Higgs field. Thiscoupling arises in the study of (4+1)-dimensional vortices in theEinstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) system.
