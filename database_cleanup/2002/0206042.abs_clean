We discuss the fully non-linear formulation of multigravity. The concept ofuniversality classes of effective Lagrangians describing bigravity, which isthe simplest form of multigravity, is introduced. We show that non-linearmultigravity theories can naturally arise in several different physicalnon-commutative geometry models. The formal and phenomenological aspects ofmultigravity (including the problems linked to the linearized theory of massivegravitons) are briefly discussed.
