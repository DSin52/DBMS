Divergent part of the one-loop effective action for the Yang-Mills theory ina special gauge containing forth degrees of ghost fields and allowing additionof BRST-invariant mass term is calculated by the generalized t'Hooft-Veltmantechnique. The result is BRST-invariant and defines running mass, couplingconstant and parameter of the gauge.
