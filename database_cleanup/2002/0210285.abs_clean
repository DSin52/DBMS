We consider a model of brane world gravity in the context of non-conformalnon-SUSY matter. In particular we modify the earlier strong coupling solutionto the glueball spectrum in an $AdS^7$ Black Hole by introducing aRandall-Sundrum Planck brane as a UV cut-off. The consequence is a newnormalizable zero mass tensor state, which gives rise to an effectiveEinstein-Hilbert theory of gravity, with exponentially small corrections set bythe mass gap to the discrete glueball spectrum. However the simplestmicroscopic theory for the Planck brane is found to have a tachyonicinstability in the radion mode.
