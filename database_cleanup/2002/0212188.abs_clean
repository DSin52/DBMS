We examine the fluctuations around a Dp-brane solution in an unstable D-branesystem using boundary states and also boundary string field theory. We showthat the fluctuations correctly reproduce the fields on the Dp-brane. Pluggingthese into the action of the unstable D-brane system, we recover not only thetension and RR charge, but also full effective action of the Dp-brane exactly.Our method works for general unstable D-brane systems and provides a simpleproof of D-brane descent/ascent relations under the tachyon condensation. Inthe lowest dimensional unstable D-brane system, called K-matrix theory,D-branes are described in terms of operator algebra. We show the equivalence ofthe geometric and algebraic descriptions of a D-brane world-volume manifoldusing the equivalence between path integral and operator formulation of theboundary quantum mechanics. As a corollary, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem isnaturally obtained by looking at the coupling to RR-fields. We also generalizethe argument to type I string theory.
