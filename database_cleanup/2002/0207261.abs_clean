Combining an optimized expansion scheme in the spirit of the background fieldmethod with the Coleman's normal-ordering renormalization prescription, wecalculate the effective potential of sine-Gordon field theory beyond theGaussian approximation. The first-order result is just the sine-Gordon Gaussianeffective potential (GEP). For the range of the coupling beta^2 <= 3.4 pi (anapproximate value), a calculation with Mathematica indicates that the result upto the second order is finite without any further renormalization procedure andtends to improve the GEP more substantially while beta^2 increases from zero.
