Title: On classical electrodynamics in odd-dimensional worlds

Comments: LaTeX, 4 pages

Given the conventional Maxwell-Lorentz formulation of classicalelectrodynamics in a flat spacetime of arbitrary odd dimension, the retardedvector potential $A^\mu$ generated by a point-like charge is found to be puregauge, $A^\mu=\partial^\mu\chi$. By the Gauss law, the charge vanishes.Therefore, classical electromagnetism is missing from odd-dimensional worlds.By contrast, a particle interacting with a scalar field generates nonzero fieldstrength. If the electromagnetic action is augmented by the addition of theChern-Simons term, the interaction picture in the three-dimensional worldbecomes nontrivial.
