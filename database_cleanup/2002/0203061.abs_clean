We consider the breaking of N=1 supersymmetry by non-zero G-flux whenM-theory is compactified on a smooth manifold X of G_2 holonomy. Gukov hasproposed a superpotential W to describe this breaking in the low-energyeffective theory. We check this proposal by comparing the bosonic potentialimplied by W with the corresponding potential deduced from theeleven-dimensional supergravity action. One interesting aspect of this check isthat, though W depends explicitly only on G-flux supported on X, W alsodescribes the breaking of supersymmetry by G-flux transverse to X.
