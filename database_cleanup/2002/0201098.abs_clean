I consider a class of Grand Unified models, in which E8 is broken toSU(3)xSU(2)xSU(2)xSU(2)xU(1)_Y, then to SU(3)xSU(2)_{diag}xU(1)_Y. The breakingof (SU(2))^3 to SU(2)_{diag} reduces the SU(2) coupling constant, atunification, by a factor of 1/\sqrt{3}, so that the ratio of the SU(3) andSU(2)_{diag} coupling constants, at unification, is equal to the ratio observedat about 1 TeV. By choosing a suitable alignment of U(1)_Y, and introducing ageneralization of the CKM matrix, the U(1)_Y coupling constants of the observedfermions, at unification, can also be arranged to have the ratios, to the SU(3)coupling constant, that are observed at about 1 TeV. This suggests a model ofHeterotic M-Theory, with a standard embedding of the spin connection in one ofthe E8s, but with the visible sector now having the E8 that is unbroken atunification. The universe is pictured as a thick pipe, where the long directionof the pipe represents the four extended dimensions, the circumferencerepresents a compact six-manifold, and the radial direction represents theeleventh dimension. The inner radius of the pipe is about 10^{-19} metres, andthe outer radius of the pipe is about 10^{-14} metres. We live on the innersurface of the pipe. The low-energy generation structure and the high mass ofthe top quark follow from the breaking pattern, and gravity and the Yang-Millsinteractions are unified at about 1 TeV. Parity breaking must occurspontaneously in four dimensions, rather than being inherited from tendimensions. The stability of the proton might be correlated with the entries inthe CKM matrix.
