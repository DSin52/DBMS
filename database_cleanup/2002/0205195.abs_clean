Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics involving two-component eigenfunctions isapplied to the stability equation associated with two classical configurations.The issue of stability is studied by introducing an operator technique for theBogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) on two domain walls in a scalar potentialmodel with minimal $N=1-$supersymmetry.
