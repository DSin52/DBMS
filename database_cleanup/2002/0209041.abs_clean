Recent progress in theoretical physics suggests that the dark energy in theuniverse might be resulted from the rolling tachyon field of string theory.Measurements to SNe Ia can be helpful to reconstruct the equation of state ofthe rolling tachyon which is a possible candidate of dark energy. We present anumerical analysis for the evolution of the equation of state of the rollingtachyon and derive the reconstruction equations for the equation of state aswell as the potential.
