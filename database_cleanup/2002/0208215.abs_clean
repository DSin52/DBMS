Skyrme theory on S^2 (Faddeev coset proposal), is analyzed with ageneralization of 0-curvature integrability, based on gauge techniques. Newexpressions valid for models in the sphere are given. The relation of theminimum energy configurations to gauge vacua is clarified. Consequences ofadding a potential term to break the SO(3) symmetry are discussed.
