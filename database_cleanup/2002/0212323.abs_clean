We obtain a gauged supergravity theory in three dimensions with eight realsupersymmetries by means of a Scherk-Schwarz reduction of pure N=(1,0)supergravity in six dimension on the SU(2) group manifold. The SU(2) Yang-Millsfields in the model propagate, since they have an ordinary kinetic term inaddition to Chern-Simons couplings. The other propagating degrees of freedomconsist of a dilaton, five scalars which parameterise the coset SL(3,R)/SO(3),three vector fields in the adjoint of SU(2), and twelve spin 1/2 fermions. Themodel admits an AdS_3 vacuum solution. We also show how a charged black holesolution can be obtained, by performing a dimensional reduction of the rotatingself-dual string of six-dimensional (1,0) supergravity.
