A cosmological model based on Kaluza-Klein theory is studied. A metric, inwhich the scale factor of the compact space evolves as an inverse power of theradius of the observable universe, is constructed. TheFreedmann-Robertson-Walker equations of standard four-dimensional cosmology areobtained precisely. The pressure in our universe is an effective pressureexpressed in terms of the components of the higher dimensional energy-momentumtensor. In particular, this effective pressure could be negative and mighttherefore explain the acceleration of our present universe. A special featureof this model is that, for a suitable choice of the parameters of the metric,the higher dimensional gravitational coupling constant could be negative.
