We provide a new class of exactly solvable superconformal field theories thatcorresponds to type II compactification on manifolds with exceptionalholonomies. We combine N=1 Liouville field and N=1 coset models and constructmodular invariant partition functions of strings moving on these manifolds. Theresulting theories preserve spacetime supersymmetry. Also we explicitlyconstruct chiral currents in these models to realize consistent stringtheories.
