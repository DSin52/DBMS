Considering a Skyrme model with a peculiar gauging of the symmetry,monopole-like solutions exist through a topological lower bound. However, itwas recently shown that these objects cannot form bound states in the limit ofvanishing Skyrme coupling. Here we consider these monopoles in scalar-tensorgravity. A numerical study of the equations reveals that neither the couplingto gravity nor to the scalar dilaton nor to dilaton-gravity leads to boundmultimonopole states.
