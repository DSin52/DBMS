Crosscap states for orientifolds of Euclidean AdS_3 are constructed. We showthat our crosscap states describe the same orientifolds which were obtained bythe classical analysis. The spectral density of open strings in the system withorientifold can be read from the M"obius strip amplitudes and it is compared tothat of the open strings stretched between branes and their mirrors. We alsocompute the Klein bottle amplitudes.
