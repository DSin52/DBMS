We find a general class of pp-wave string solutions with NS-NS $H_3$ or R-R$F_3$ field strengths, which are analogous to solutions with non-constant $F_5$all pp-wave solutions supported by non-constant $H_3$ or $F_p$ fields are exacttype II superstring solutions to all orders in $\a'$; (ii) the correspondinglight-cone gauge Green-Schwarz actions are non-linear in bosons but alwaysquadratic in fermions, and describe UV finite 2-d theories; (iii) the pp-wavebackgrounds supported by non-constant $F_3$ field do not have, in contrast totheir $F_5$-field counterparts, ``supernumerary'' supersymmetries and thus theassociated light-cone GS actions do not possess 2-d supersymmetry. We considera specific example where the pp-wave $F_3$ background is parametrized by anarbitrary holomorphic function of one complex bosonic coordinate. Thecorresponding GS action has the same bosonic part, similar Yukawa terms buttwice as many interacting world-sheet fermions as the (2,2) supersymmetricmodel originating from the analogous $F_5$ background. We also discuss thestructure of massless scalar vertex operators in the models related to N=2super sine-Gordon and N=2 super Liouville theories.
