We show that the Bronnikov theorem on the nonexistence of regularelectrically charged black holes can be circumvented. In the frame of nonlinearelectrodynamics, we present the exact regular black hole solutions of a hybridtype. They are electrically charged, but contain a `dual' core confining apolarization of magnetic charges.The considered example is based on a modification of the Ay\'on-Beato &Garc\'\i a solution. It represents a very specific realization of the idea onconfinement based on dual electrodynamics and dual superconductivity.
