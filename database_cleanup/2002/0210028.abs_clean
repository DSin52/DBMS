Title: Comment on the Decoupling of UV and IR Divergencies within Dimensional

Regularization in Noncommutative TheoriesAuthors: H. Huffel

Comments: 4 pages, Latex

In a recent paper hep-ph/0208225 it has been claimed that to one-loop orderin noncommutative phi^4 scalar field theory using dimensional regularizationthe UV and IR divergencies decouple. We point out that this statement isincorrect.
