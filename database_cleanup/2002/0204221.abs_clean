We consider the maximal supersymmetric pure Yang-Mills theories on six andeight dimensional space. We determine, in a systematic way, all the possiblefractions of supersymmetry preserved by the BPS states and present thecorresponding `self-dual' BPS equations. In six dimensions the intrinsic onehas 1/4 supersymmetry, while in eight dimensions, 1/16, 2/16, ..., 6/16. Weapply our results to some explicit BPS configurations of finite or infiniteenergy on commutative or noncommutative spaces.
