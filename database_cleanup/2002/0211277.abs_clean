Authors: Joaquin Sanchez-Guillen, L.A. Ferreira

Comments: Talk at the Workshop on integrable theories, solitons and duality.

IFT Sao Paulo July 2002Skyrme theories on S^3 and S^2, are analyzed using the generalized zerocurvature in any dimensions. In the first case, new symmetries and integrablesectors, including the B =1 skyrmions, are unraveled. In S^2 the relation toQCD suggested by Faddeev is discussed
