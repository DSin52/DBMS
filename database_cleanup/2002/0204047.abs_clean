We take steps toward constructing explicit solutions that describenon-extremal charged dilatonic branes of string/M-theory with a transversecircle. Using a new coordinate system we find an ansatz for the solutions withonly one unknown function. We show that this function is independent of thecharge and our ansatz can therefore also be used to construct neutral blackholes on cylinders and near-extremal charged dilatonic branes with a transversecircle. For sufficiently large mass $M > M_c$ these solutions have a horizonthat connects across the cylinder but they are not translationally invariantalong the circle direction. We argue that the neutral solution has largerentropy than the neutral black string for any given mass. This means that for$M > M_c$ the neutral black string can gain entropy by redistributing its massto a solution that breaks translational invariance along the circle, despitethe fact that it is classically stable. We furthermore explain how ourconstruction can be used to study the thermodynamics of Little String Theory.
