We extend the BMN duality between IIB superstring theory on a pp-wavebackground and a sector of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory to thenon-supersymmetric and unstable background built by Romans as acompactification on a U(1) bundle over CP2 with 3-form and 5-form fieldstrength fluxes. We obtain a stable theory with the fewest number ofsupercharges (e.g. 16) allowed by this kind of solutions and make conjectureson the dual gauge theory.
