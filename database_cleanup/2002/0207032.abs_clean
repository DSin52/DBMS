The conjecture that M-theory has the rank eleven Kac-Moody symmetry e11implies that Type IIA and Type IIB string theories in ten dimensions possesscertain infinite dimensional perturbative symmetry algebras that we determine.This prediction is compared with the symmetry algebras that can be constructedin perturbative string theory, using the closed string analogues of the DDFoperators. Within the limitations of this construction close agreement isfound. We also perform the analogous analysis for the case of the closedbosonic string.
