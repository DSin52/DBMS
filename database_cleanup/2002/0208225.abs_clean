We present new solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity infour dimensions describing black holes which asymptote to the linear dilatonbackground. In the non-rotating case they can be obtained as the limitinggeometry of dilaton black holes. The rotating solutions (possibly endowed witha NUT parameter) are constructed using a generating technique based on theSp(4,R) duality of the EMDA system. In a certain limit (with no event horizonpresent) our rotating solutions coincide with supersymmetricIsrael-Wilson-Perjes type dilaton-axion solutions. In presence of an eventhorizon supersymmetry is broken. The temperature of the static black holes isconstant, and their mass does not depend on it, so the heat capacity is zero.We investigate geodesics and wave propagation in these spacetimes and findsuperradiance in the rotating case. Because of the non-asymptotically flatnature of the geometry, certain modes are reflected from infinity, inparticular, all superradiant modes are confined. This leads to classicalinstability of the rotating solutions. The non-rotating linear dilaton blackholes are shown to be stable under spherical perturbations.
