Title: New Deformation of ${\cal N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills Theory

Comments: Latex file, JHEP class, 9 pages, no figures

We propose a new algebraic deformation of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM via decompositionof spinor and scalar fields in vector supermultiplet. This decompositiongenerates degrees of freedom of usual quarks and leptons and the deformationmodel is a low energy effective model. We show that supersymmetry is broken incertain limit and the deformation model reduces to a SM-like model, or aQCD-like model. Meanwhile, gauge symmetry can be spontaneously broken bynontrivial supersymmetry vacuum.
