Comments: 23 pages, latex, sections rewritten and references added

A black string generaliztion of the Myers-Perry N dimensional rotating blackhole is considered in an (N+1) dimensional Randall-Sundrum brane world. Theblack string intercepts the (N-1) brane in a N dimensional rotating black hole.We examine the diverse cases arising for various non-zero rotation componentsand obtain the geodesic equations for these space-time. The asymptotics oftheresulting brane world geometries and their implications are discussed.
