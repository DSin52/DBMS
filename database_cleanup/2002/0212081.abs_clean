We cast M-brane interactions including intersecting membranes and five-branesin manifestly gauge invariant form using an arrangement of higher dimensionalDirac surfaces. We show that the noncommutative gauge symmetry present in thedoubled M-theory formalism involving dual 3-form and 6-form gauge fields ispreserved in a form quantised over the integers. The proper context fordiscussing large noncommutative gauge transformations is relative cohomology,in which the 3-form transformation parameters become exact when restricted tothe five-brane worldvolume. We show how this structure yields the lattice ofM-theory charges and gives rise to the conjectured 7D Hopf-Wess-Zumino term.
