Title: Two Families of Geometric Field Theories

Authors: Frank B. Estabrook

Comments: 12 pages; two figures available from author

We present two families of exterior differential systems (EDS) for causalembeddings of orthonormal frame bundles over Riemannian spaces of dimension q =2,3,4,5.. into orthonormal frame bundles over flat spaces of higher dimension.We calculate Cartan characters showing that these EDS are dynamical fieldtheories. The first family includes a new non-isometric embedding EDS forclassical Einstein vacuum relativity (q = 4). The second, generated only by2-forms, is a family of classical "stringy" or Kaluza-type (q = 5) integrablesystems. Cartan forms are found for all these dynamical systems.
