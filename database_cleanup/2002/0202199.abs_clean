Solutions of the Polchinski exact renormalization group equation in thescalar O(N) theory are studied. Families of regular solutions are found andtheir relation with fixed points of the theory is established. Specialattention is devoted to the limit $N=\infty$, where many properties can beanalyzed analytically.
