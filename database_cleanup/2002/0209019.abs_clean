We propose a new method to determine the unknown parameter associated to aself-consistent harmonic approximation. We check the validity of our techniquein the context of the sine-Gordon model. As a non trivial application weconsider the scaling regime of the 2D Ising model away from the critical pointand in the presence of a magnetic field $h$. We derive an expression thatrelates the approximate correlation length $\xi$, $T-T_c$ and $h$.
