Title: Noncommutative relativistic particle

Authors: A.A. Deriglazov

Comments: 5 pages

Noncommutative version of D-dimensional relativistic particle is proposed. Weconsider the particle interacting with the configuration space variable$\theta^{\mu\nu}(\tau)$ instead of the numerical matrix. The correspondingPoincare invariant action has a local symmetry, which allows one to impose thegauge $\theta^{0i}=0, ~ \theta^{ij}=const$. The matrix $\theta^{ij}$ turns outto be the noncommutativity parameter of the gauge fixed formulation. Poincaretransformations of the gauge fixed formulation are presented in the manifestform.
