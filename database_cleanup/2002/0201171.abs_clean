We construct Poisson brackets at boundaries of open strings and membraneswith constant background fields which are compatible with their boundaryconditions. The boundary conditions are treated as primary constraints whichgive infinitely many secondary constraints. We show explicitly that we needonly two (the primary one and one of the secondary ones) constraints todetermine Poisson brackets of strings. We apply this to membranes by usingcanonical transformations.
