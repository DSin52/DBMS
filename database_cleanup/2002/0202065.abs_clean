Seiberg-Witten mapAuthors: Elias Kiritsis and Corneliu Sochichiu

Comments: JHEP LaTeX style, 23 pages, new refs added

We study the equivalence/duality between various non-commutative gauge modelsat the classical and quantum level. The duality is realised by a linearSeiberg-Witten-like map. The infinitesimal form of this map is analysed in moredetails.
