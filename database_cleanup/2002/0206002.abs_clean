The single 3-brane brane world at six dimension is examined when the extradimensions are not compact. Although the warp factor diverges at the asymptoticregion of the extra dimension, the normalizable zero mode and higher KKspectrum exist in the gravitational fluctuation. We compute the zero modeanalytically and KK spectrum numerically. It is explicitly proven that oursolution does not obey `brane world sum rule'.
