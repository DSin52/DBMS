typos correctedWe introduce a technique for restoring general coordinate invariance intotheories where it is explicitly broken. This is the analog for gravity of theCallan-Coleman-Wess-Zumino formalism for gauge theories. We use this toelucidate the properties of interacting massless and massive gravitons. For asingle graviton with a Planck scale Mpl and a mass mg, we find that there is asensible effective field theory which is valid up to a high-energy cutoffLambda parametrically above mg. Our methods allow for a transparentunderstanding of the many peculiarities associated with massive gravitons,among them the need for the Fierz-Pauli form of the Lagrangian, the presence orabsence of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity in general backgrounds,and the onset of non-linear effects and the breakdown of the effective theoryat large distances from heavy sources. The natural sizes of all non-linearcorrections beyond the Fierz-Pauli term are easily determined. The cutoffscales as Lambda ~ (mg^4 Mpl)^(1/5) for the Fierz-Pauli theory, but can beraised to Lambda ~ (mg^2 Mpl)^(1/3) in certain non-linear extensions. Havingestablished that these models make sense as effective theories, there are anumber of new avenues for exploration, including model building with gravity intheory space and constructing gravitational dimensions.
