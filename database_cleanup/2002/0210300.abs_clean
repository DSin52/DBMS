We discuss the holography and entropy bounds in Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory.By applying a Geroch process to an arbitrary spherically symmetric black hole,we show that the Bekenstein entropy bound always keeps its form as $S_{\rmB}=2\pi E R$, independent of gravity theories. As a result, theBekenstein-Verlinde bound also remains unchanged. Along the Verlinde'sapproach, we obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking bound and Hubble bound, which aredifferent from those in Einstein gravity. Furthermore, we note that when$HR=1$, the three cosmological entropy bounds become identical as in the caseof Einstein gravity. But, the Friedmann equation in Gauss-Bonnet gravity can nolonger be cast to the form of cosmological Cardy formula.
