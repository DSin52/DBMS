By employing D6-branes intersecting at angles in $D = 4$ type IIA strings, weconstruct {\em four stack string GUT models} (PS-I class), that contain at lowenergy {\em exactly the three generation Standard model} with no extra matterand/or extra gauge group factors. These classes of models are based on thePati-Salam (PS) gauge group $SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$. Theyrepresent deformations around the quark and lepton basic intersection numberstructure. The models possess the same phenomenological characteristics of somerecently discussed examples (PS-A class) of four stack PS GUTS. Namely, thereare no colour triplet couplings to mediate proton decay and proton is stable asbaryon number is a gauged symmetry. Neutrinos get masses of the correct sizes.Also the mass relation$m_e = m_d$ at the GUT scale is recovered.Moreover, we clarify the novel role of {\em extra} branes, the latter havingnon-trivial intersection numbers with quarks and leptons and creating scalarsinglets, needed for the satisfaction of RR tadpole cancellation conditions.The presence of N=1 supersymmetry in sectors involving the {\em extra} branesis equivalent to the, model dependent, orthogonality conditions of the U(1)'ssurviving massless the generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism.The use of{\em extra} branes creates mass couplings that predict the appearance of lightfermion doublets up to the scale of electroweak scale symmetry breaking.
