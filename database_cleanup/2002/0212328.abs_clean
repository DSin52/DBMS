Title: ADHMN boundary conditions from removing monopoles

Authors: Xingang Chen and Erick J. Weinberg

Comments: 37 pages, 6 figures

Boundary conditions play an important role in the ADHMN construction of BPSmonopole solutions. In this paper we show how different types of boundaryconditions can be related to each other by removing monopoles to spatialinfinity. In particular, we use this method to show how the jumping datanaturally emerge. The results can be interpreted in the D-brane picture andprovide a better understanding of the derivation of the ADHMN construction fromD-branes. We comment briefly on the cases with non-Abelian unbroken symmetryand massless monopoles.
