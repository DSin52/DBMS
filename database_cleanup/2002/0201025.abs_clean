We consider noncommutative gauge theories which have zero mass statespropagating along both commutative and noncommutative dimensions. Solitons inthese theories generically carry U(m) gauge group on their world-volume. Fromthe point of view of string theory, these solitons correspond to``branes within branes''. We show that once the world-volume U(m) gauge theoryis in the Higgs phase, light states become quasi-localized, rather thanstrictly localized on the soliton, i.e. they mix with light bulk modes and havefinite widths to escape into the noncommutative dimensions. At small values ofU(m) symmetry breaking parameters, these widths are small compared to thecorresponding masses. Explicit examples considered are adjoint scalar field inthe background of a noncommutative vortex in U(1)-Higgs theory, and gaugefields in instanton backgrounds in pure gauge noncommutative theories.
