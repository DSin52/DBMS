We suggest a new method for the calculation of the nonlocal part of theeffective action. It is based on resummation of perturbation series for theheat kernel and its functional trace at large values of the proper timeparameter. We derive a new, essentially nonperturbative, nonlocal contributionto the effective action in spacetimes with dimensions $d>2$.
