Renormalization group limit cycles may be a commonplace for quantumHamiltonians requiring renormalization, in contrast to experience to date withclassical models of critical points, where fixed points are far more common. Wediscuss the simplest model Hamiltonian identified to date that exhibits arenormalization group limit cycle. The model is a discrete Hamiltonian with twocoupling constants and a non-perturbative renormalization group that involveschanges in only one of these couplings and is soluble analytically. TheHamiltonian is the discrete analog to a continuum Hamiltonian previouslyproposed by us.
