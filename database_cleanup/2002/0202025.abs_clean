By using the so-called Information Metric on the moduli space of ananti-selfdual (ASD) Instanton in a Self-Dual (SD) Non-Commutative background,we investigate the geometry of moduli space. The metric is evaluatedperturbatively in non-commutativity parameter and we show that by putting acut-off in the location of instanton in the definition of Information Metric wecan recover the five dimensional space time in the presence of a B-field. Thisresult shows that the non-commutative YM-Instanton Moduli corresponds toD-Instanton Moduli in the gravity side where the radial and transverse locationof D-Instanton are corresponding to YM-Instanton size and location,respectively. The match is shown in the first order of non-commutativityparameter.
