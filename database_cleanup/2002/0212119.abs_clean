The aim of this work is to present a general theory of coset models G/H inwhich different left and right actions of H on G are gauged. Our main resultsinclude a formula for their modular invariant partition function, theconstruction of a large set of boundary states and a general description of thecorresponding brane geometries. The paper concludes with some explicitapplications to the base of the conifold and to the time-dependent Nappi-Wittenbackground.
