nonlocality properties of Weyl-squared terms in braneworld action and phasetransitions between local and nonlocal phases of the theory, to appear inPhys. Rev. DWe construct the nonlocal braneworld action in the two-brane Randall-Sundrumaction is written as a functional of the two metric and radion fields on thebranes. This action effectively describes the dynamics of the gravitationalfield both on the branes and in the bulk in terms of the brane geometriesdirectly accessible for observations. Its nonlocal form factors incorporate thecumulative effect of the bulk Kaluza-Klein modes. We also consider the reducedversion of this action obtained by integrating out the fields on thenegative-tension brane invisible from the viewpoint of the Planckian braneobserver. This effective action features a nontrivial transition (AdS flow)between the local and nonlocal phases of the theory associated with the limitsof small and large interbrane separation. Our results confirm a recentlyproposed braneworld scenario with diverging (repulsive) branes and suggestpossible new implications of this phase transition in brane cosmology.
