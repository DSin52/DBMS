We present a supersymmetric D-brane model that has CP spontaneously broken bydiscrete torsion. The low energy physics is largely independent of thecompactification scheme and the kahler metric has `texture zeros' dictated bythe choice of discrete torsion. This motivates a simple ansatz for the kahlermetric which results in a CKM matrix given in terms of two free parameters,hence we predict a single mixing angle and the CKM phase. The CKM phase ispredicted to be close to Pi/3.
