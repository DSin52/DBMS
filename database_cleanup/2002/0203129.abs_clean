In this note we explore the possibility of obtaining gauge bosons andfermionic spectrum as close as possible to the Standard Model content, byplacing D3-branes at a ZN orbifold-like singularity in the presence ofD7-branes. Indeed, we find that this is plausible provided a sufficiently highN is allowed for and the singular point is also fixed by an orientifold action.If extra charged matter is not permitted then the singularity shouldnecessarily be non-supersymmetric. Correct hypercharge assignments require adependence on some Abelian gauge D7-groups. In achieving such a construction wefollow a recent observation made in Ref. [hep-th/0105155] about the possibilitythat, the three left handed quarks, would present different U(2) transformationproperties.
