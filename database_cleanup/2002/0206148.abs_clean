A superembedding construction of general non-abelian Born-Infeld actions inthree dimensions is described. These actions have rigid target space and localworldvolume supersymmetry(i.e. kappa symmetry). The standard abelianBorn-Infeld gauge multiplet is augmented with an additional worldvolume SU(N)gauge supermultiplet. It is shown how to construct single-trace actions and inparticular a kappa-supersymmetric extension of the symmetrised trace action.
