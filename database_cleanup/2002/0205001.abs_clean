Title: Phase Transitions for Gauge Theories on Tori from the AdS/CFT

CorrespondenceAuthors: Don N. Page

Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX

The vacuum of a large-N gauge field on a p-torus has a spatial stress tensorwith tension along the direction of smallest periodicity and equal pressures(but p times smaller in magnitude) along the other directions, assuming anAdS/CFT correspondence and a refined form of the Horowitz-Myers positive-energyconjecture. For infinite N, the vacuum exhibits a phase transition when thelengths of the two shortest periodicities cross. A comparison is made with theSurya-Schleich-Witt phase transition at finite temperature. A zero-loopapproximation is also given for large but finite N.
