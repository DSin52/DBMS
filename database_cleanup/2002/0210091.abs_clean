String solitons in AdS_5 contain information of N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills theorieson the boundary. Recent proposals for rotating string solitons reproduce thespectrum for anomalous dimensions of Wilson operators for the boundary theory.There are possible extensions of this duality for lower supersymmetric and evenfor non-supesymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We explicitly demonstrate that thesupersymmetric anomalous dimensions of Wilson operators in N=0,1 Yang-Millstheories behave, for large spin J, at the two-loop level in perturbationtheory, like log J. We compile the analytic one- and two-loop results for theN=0 case which is known in the literature, as well as for the N=1 case whichseems to be missing.
