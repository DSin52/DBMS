It is shown that the SO(3) gauge field configurations can be completelycharacterised by certain gauge invariant vector fields. The singularities ofthese vector fields describe the topological aspects of the gauge fieldconfigurations. The topological (or monopole) charge is expressed in terms ofan Abelian vector potential.
