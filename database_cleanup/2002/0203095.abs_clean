We develop the description of non-commutative geometry of the 4-dimensionalquantum Hall fluid's theory proposed recently by Zhang and Hu. Thenon-commutative structure of fuzzy $S^{4}$ appears naturally in this theory.The fuzzy monopole harmonics, which are the essential elements in thisnon-commutative geometry, are explicitly constructed and their obeying thematrix algebra is obtained. This matrix algebra is associative. We also proposea fusion scheme of the fuzzy monopole harmonics of the coupling system fromthose of the subsystems, and determine the fusion rule in such fusion scheme.By products, we provide some essential ingredients of the theory of SO(5)angular momentum. In particular, the explicit expression of the couplingcoefficients, in the theory of SO(5) angular momentum, are given. It isdiscussed that some possible applications of our results to the 4-dimensionalquantum Hall system and the matrix brane construction in M-theory.
