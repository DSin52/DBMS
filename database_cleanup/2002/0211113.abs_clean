Interacting AdS_4 higher spin gauge theories with N \geq 1 supersymmetry sofar have been formulated as constrained systems of differential forms living ina twistor extension of 4D spacetime. Here we formulate the minimal N=1 theoryin superspace, leaving the internal twistor space intact. Remarkably, thesuperspace constraints have the same form as those defining the theory inordinary spacetime. This construction generalizes straightforwardly to higherspin gauge theories N>1 supersymmetry.
