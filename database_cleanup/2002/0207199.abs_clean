We construct a non-Abelian world volume effective action for a system ofmultiple M-theory gravitons. This action contains multipole moment couplings tothe eleven-dimensional background potentials. We use these couplings to study,from the microscopical point of view, giant graviton configurations where thegravitons expand into an M2-brane, with the topology of a fuzzy 2-sphere, thatlives in the spherical part of the AdS_7 x S^4 background or in the AdS part ofAdS_4 x S^7. When the number of gravitons is large we find perfect agreementwith the Abelian, macroscopical description of giant gravitons given in theliterature.
