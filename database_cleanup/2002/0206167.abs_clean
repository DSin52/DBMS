BMN operators are characterized by the fact that they have infinite R-chargeand finite anomalous dimension in the BMN double scaling limit. Using thisfact, we show that the BMN operators close under operator product expansion andform a sector in the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We then identifyshort-distance limits of general BMN n-point correlators, and show how theycorrespond to the pp-wave string interactions. We also discuss instantons inthe light of the pp-wave/SYM correspondence.
