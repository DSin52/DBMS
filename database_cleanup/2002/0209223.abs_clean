We show that the Ginsparg-Wilson (GW) relation can play an important role todefine chiral structures in {\it finite} noncommutative geometries. EmployingGW relation, we can prove the index theorem and construct topologicalinvariants even if the system has only finite degrees of freedom. As anexample, we consider a gauge theory on a fuzzy two-sphere and give an explicitconstruction of a noncommutative analog of the GW relation, chirality operatorand the index theorem. The topological invariant is shown to coincide with the1st Chern class in the commutative limit.
