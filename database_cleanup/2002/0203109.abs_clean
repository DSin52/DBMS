Title: Lectures on open strings, and noncommutative gauge fields

Comments: harvmac, 12 pp

The background independent formulation of the gauge theories on D-branes inflat space-time is considered, some examples of the solutions of theirequations of motion are presented, the solutions of Dirac equation in thesebackgrounds are analyzed, and the generalizations to the curved spaces, likeorbifolds, conifolds, and K3 surfaces, are discussed.
