points. Details at the top of the fileThis paper shows how to construct anomaly free world sheet actions in stringtheory with $D$-branes. Our method is to use Deligne cohomology and bundlegerbe theory to define geometric objects which are naturally associated to$D$-branes and connections on them. The holonomy of these connections can beused to cancel global anomalies in the world sheet action.
