Title: Contribution of Kaluza-Klein modes to vacuum energy in models with large

extra dimensions $&$ the Cosmological constantComments: 9 page Latex

In this paper, the generation of topological energy in models with largeextra dimensions is investigated. The origin of this energy is attributed to atopological deformation of the standard Minkowski vacuum due tocompactification of extra dimensions. This deformation is seen to give rise toan effective, finite energy density due to massive Kaluza-Klein modes ofgravitation. It's renormalized value is seen to depend on the size of the extradimensions instead of the UV cut-off of the theory. It is shown that if thisenergy density is to contribute to the observed cosmological constant, therewill be extremely stringent bounds on the number of extra dimensions and theirsize.
