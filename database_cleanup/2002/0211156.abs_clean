In the Berkooz-Douglas matrix model of M theory in the presence oflongitudinal $M5$-brane, we investigate the effective dynamics of the system byconsidering the longitudinal $M5$-brane as the background and the spherical$M5$-brane related with the other space dimensions as the probe brane. Due tothere exists the background field strength provided by the source of thelongitudinal $M5$-brane, an open membrane should be ended on the spherical$M5$-brane based on the topological reason. The formation of the bound braneconfiguration for the open membrane ending on the 5-branes in the background oflongitudinal 5-brane can be used to model the 4-dimensional quantum Hall systemproposed recently by Zhang and Hu. The description of the excitations of thequantum Hall soliton brane configuration is established by investigating thefluctuations of $D0$-branes living on the bound brane around their classicalsolution derived by the transformations of area preserving diffeomorphisms ofthe open membrane. We find that this effective field theory for thefluctuations is an SO(4) non-commutative Chern-Simons field theory. The matrixregularized version of this effective field theory is given in order to allowthe finite $D0$-branes to live on the bound brane. We also discuss somepossible applications of our results to the related topics in M-theory and tothe 4-dimensional quantum Hall system.
