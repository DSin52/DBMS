The modification to four--dimensional Einstein gravity at low energy in twobrane models is investigated within supergravity in singular spaces. Usingperturbation theory around a static BPS background, we study the effectivefour--dimensional gravitational theory, a scalar--tensor theory, and derive theBrans--Dicke parameter when matter is present on the positive tension braneonly. We show there is an attractor mechanism towards general relativity in thematter dominated era. The dynamics of the interbrane distance are discussed.Finally, when matter lives on both branes, we find that there is a violation ofthe equivalence principle whose magnitude is governed by the warping of theextra dimension.
