The quantum equivalence between sigma-models and their non-abelian T-dualisedpartners is examined for a large class of four dimensional non-homogeneous andquasi-Einstein metrics with an isometry group SU(2) times U(1). We prove thatthe one-loop renormalisability of the initial torsionless sigma-models isequivalent to the one-loop renormalisability of the T-dualised torsionfulmodel. For a subclass of Kahler original metrics, the dual partners are stillKahler (with torsion).
