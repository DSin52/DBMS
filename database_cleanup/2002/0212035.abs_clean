Title: Boundary conditions as constraints

Authors: Juan M. Romero and J. David Vergara

A new method to compute the symplectic structure of a quantum field theorywith non trivial boundary conditions is proposed. Following the suggestion inclass constraints in the sense of the Dirac's method. However, we show thatthis proposal is more useful if we consider an inverse of the Holographic mapbetween a theory defined in the boundary to another with constraints butwithout boundary.
