In this paper the consistency of the de Sitter invariant $\alpha $-vacua,which have been introduced as simple tools to study the effects oftransplanckian physics, is investigated. In particular possible nonrenormalization problems are discussed, as well as non standard properties ofGreens functions. We also discuss the non thermal properties of the $\alpha$-vacua and the necessity of $\alpha$ to change. The conclusion is that non ofthese problems necessarily exclude an application of the $\alpha $-vacua toinflation.
