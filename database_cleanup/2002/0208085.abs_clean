Title: Comments on D-branes in flux backgrounds

Authors: Arvind Rajaraman

Comments: 15 pages, latex

We construct supergravity solutions for D-branes in nontrivial fluxbackgrounds. We revisit the issue of charge quantization in this framework, andshow that in these backgrounds, charge need not be quantized. We also show in aparticular example that the semiclassical description of branes producesintegral charges.
