We study theoretical aspects of the rotating black hole production andevaporation in the extra dimension scenarios with TeV scale gravity, within themass range in which the higher dimensional Kerr solution provides gooddescription. We evaluate the production cross section of black holes takingtheir angular momenta into account. We find that it becomes larger than theSchwarzschild radius squared, which is conventionally utilized in literature,and our result nicely agrees with the recent numerical study by Yoshino andNambu within a few percent error for higher dimensional case. In the sameapproximation to obtain the above result, we find that the production crosssection becomes larger for the black hole with larger angular momentum. Second,we derive the generalized Teukolsky equation for spin 0, 1/2 and 1 brane fieldsin the higher dimensional Kerr geometry and explicitly show that it isseparable in any dimensions. For five-dimensional (Randall-Sundrum) black hole,we obtain analytic formulae for the greybody factors in low frequency expansionand we present the power spectra of the Hawking radiation as well as theirangular dependence. Phenomenological implications of our result are brieflysketched.
