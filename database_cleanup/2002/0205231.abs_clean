Title: Non-locality as an essential feature of brane worlds

Authors: Shinji Mukohyama

Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, to be published in the proceedings of

the YITP workshop "Braneworld -- Dynamics of spacetime with boundary --"Weak gravity in the brane world scenario with a scalar field in the bulkbetween two end-of-the-world branes is investigated by using the doubly gaugeinvariant formalism. We review the result that Einstein gravity is restored inthe low energy limit and that high-energy corrections to Einstein gravity canbe mimicked by higher derivative terms. After that, it is argued thatnon-locality is one of essential features of brane worlds.
