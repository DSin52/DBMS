We investigate Penrose limits of two classes of non-local theories, littlestring theories and non-commutative gauge theories. Penrose limits of thenear-horizon geometry of NS5-branes help to shed some light on the high energyspectrum of little string theories. We attempt to understand renormalizationgroup flow in these theories by considering Penrose limits wherein the nullgeodesic also has a radial component. In particular, we demonstrate that it ispossible to construct a pp-wave spacetime which interpolates between the lineardilaton and the AdS regions for the Type IIA NS5-brane. Similar analysis isconsidered for the holographic dual geometry to non-commutative field theories.
