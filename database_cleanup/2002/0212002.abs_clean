Nucl. Phys. BThe SO(4) isometry of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole of N=1, D=5supergravity can be partly broken, without breaking any supersymmetry, in twodifferent ways. The ``right'' solution is a rotating black hole (BMPV); the``left'' is interpreted as a black hole in a Godel universe. In ten dimensions,both spacetimes are described by deformations of the D1-D5-pp-wave system withthe property that the non-trivial Closed Timelike Curves of the fivedimensional manifold are absent in the universal covering space of the tendimensional manifold. In the decoupling limit, the BMPV deformation isnormalizable. It corresponds to the vev of an IR relevant operator of dimension\Delta=1. The Godel deformation is sub-leading in \alpha' unless we take aninfinite vorticity limit; in such case it is a non-normalizable perturbation.It corresponds to the insertion of a vector operator of dimension \Delta=5.Thus we conclude that from the dual (1+1)-CFT viewpoint the SO(4) R-symmetry isbroken `spontaneously' in the BMPV case and explicitly in the Godel case.
