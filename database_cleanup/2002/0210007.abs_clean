We determine the one-loop deformation of the conformal symmetry of a generalN}=2 superconformally invariant Yang-Mills theory. The deformation is computedfor several explicit examples which have a realization as world-volume theorieson a stack of D3 branes. These include (i) N=4 SYM with gauge groups SU(N),USp(2N) and SO(N); (ii) USp(2N) gauge theory with one hypermultiplet in thetraceless antisymmetric representation and four hypermultiplets in thefundamental; (iii) quiver gauge theory with gauge group SU(N)xSU(N) and twohypermultiplets in the bifundamental representations (N,\bar N) and (bar N,N).The existence of quantum corrections to the conformal transformations imposesrestrictions on the effective action which we study on a subset of the Coulombbranch corresponding to the separation of one brane from the stack. In the N=4case, the one-loop corrected transformations provide a realization of theconformal algebra; this deformation is shown to be one-loop exact. For theother two models, higher-loop corrections are necessary to close the algebra.Requiring closure, we infer the two-loop conformal deformation.
