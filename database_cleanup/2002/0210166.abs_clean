We describe how to reduce the fuzzy four-sphere algebra to a set of fourindependent raising and lowering oscillator operators. In terms of them wederive the projector valued operators for the fuzzy four-sphere, which are theglobal definition of k-instanton connections over this noncommutative basemanifold.
