We consider the radial Schroedinger equation with an attractive potentialsingular in the origin. The additional continuum of states caused by thesingularity, that usually remain nontreatable, are shown to correspond toparticles, asymptotically free near the singularity (in the inner channel).Depending on kinematics, they are either confined by the centre or may escapeto infinity (to the outer channel).The orthonormality within the continuum of confined states is establishedand the scattering phase of the particle emitted by the centre and thenreflected back to it is found.For the deconfinement case a unitary 2x2 S-matrix is found in terms of theJost functions, and describes transitions within and between the two channels.The volume elements in the two channels are different.The two-channel situation is analogous to the known behaviour of radiationin the black hole metrics. We discuss the black hole essence of singularlyattracting centre for classical motion and the relativity of time inherent tothis problem.
