Observational evidence suggests that our universe is presently dominated by adark energy component and undergoing accelerated expansion. We recentlyintroduced a model, motivated by string theory for short-distance physics, forexplaining dark energy without appealing to any fine-tuning. The idea of thetransplanckian dark energy (TDE) was based on the freeze-out mechanism of theultralow frequency modes, $\omega(k)$ of very short distances, by the expansionof the background universe, $\omega(k) \leq H$. In this paper we address theissue of the stress-energy tensor for the nonlinear short-distance physics andexplain the need to modify Einstein equations in this regime. From the modifiedEinstein equations we then derive the equation of state for the TDE model,which has the distinctive feature of being continually time-dependent. Theexplanation of the coincidence puzzle relies entirely on the intrinsictime-evolution of the TDE equation of state.
