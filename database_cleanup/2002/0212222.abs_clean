appear in Phys. Rev. DWe consider brane-induced gravity model in more than one extra dimensions,regularized by assuming that the bulk gravity is soft in ultraviolet. We studylinear theory about flat multi-dimensional space-time and flat brane. We firstfind that this model allows for violation of equivalence between gravitationaland inertial masses of brane matter. We then observe that the model has ascalar ghost field localized near the brane, as well as quasi-localized massivegraviton. Pure tensor structure of four-dimensional gravity on the brane atintermediate distances is due to the cancellation between the extrapolarization of the massive graviton, and the ghost. This is completelyanalogous to the situation in the GRS model.
