Title: Energy Eigenvalues of Kemmer Equation for a Homogeneous Magnetic Field

Authors: A. Havare, K. Sogut

Comments: 8 pages, no figures, submitted to J Phys. A

This article illustrates a completely algebraic method to obtain the energylevels of a massive spin-1 particle moving in a constant magnetic field. In theprocess to obtain the energy levels the wave function was written by harmonicoscillator solutions.
