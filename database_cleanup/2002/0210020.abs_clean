It has long been claimed that the antisymmetric tensor field of the secondrank is pure longitudinal after quantization. In my opinion, such a situationis quite unacceptable. I repeat the well-known procedure of the derivation ofthe set of Proca equations. It is shown that it can be written in variousforms. Furthermore, on the basis of the Lagrangian formalism I calculatedynamical invariants (including the Pauli-Lubanski vector of relativistic spinfor this field). Even at the classical level the Pauli-Lubanski vector can beequal to zero after applications of well-known constraints. The importance ofthe normalization is pointed out for the problem of the description ofquantized fields of maximal spin 1. The correct quantization procedure permitsus to propose a solution of this puzzle in the modern field theory. Finally,the discussion of the connection of the Ogievetskii-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramondfield and the electrodynamic gauge is presented.
