We study in some detail the properties of a previously proposed new class ofstring and brane models whose world-sheet (world-volume) actions are built witha modified reparametrization-invariant measure of integration and which do notcontain any ad hoc dimensionfull parameters. The ratio of the new and thestandard Riemannian integration measure densities plays the role of adynamically generated string/brane tension. The latter is identified as (themagnitude of) an effective (non-Abelian) electric field-strength on theworld-sheet/world-volume obeying the standard Gauss-law constraint. As a resulta simple classical mechanism for confinement via strings is proposed.
