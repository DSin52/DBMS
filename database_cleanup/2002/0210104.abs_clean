ground state of the massless Thirring modelAuthors: M. Faber and A. N. Ivanov

A BCS-type wave function describes the ground state of the massless Thirringmodel in the chirally broken phase. The massless Thirring model with fermionfields quantized in the chirally broken phase bosonizes to the quantum fieldtheory of the free massless (pseudo)scalar field (Eur. Phys. J. C 20, 723(2001)). The wave functions of the ground state of the free massless(pseudo)scalar field are obtained from the BCS wave function by averaging overquantum fluctuations of the Thirring fermion fields. We show that we obtainwave functions, orthogonal, normalized and non-invariant under shifts of themassless (pseudo)scalar field. This testifies the spontaneous breaking of thefield-shift symmetry in the quantum field theory of a free massless(pseudo)scalar field.
