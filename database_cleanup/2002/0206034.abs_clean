Title: Massless Thirring fermion fields in the boson field representation

Authors: M. Faber and A. N. Ivanov

Comments: 24 pages, Latex, no figures, the Appendix is added, the procedure of

the normal ordering of the exponential operators, depending on the freemassless boson fields defined in the quantum field theory without infrareddivergences, is formulatedWe show that the boson field representation of the massless fermion fields,suggested by Morchio, Pierotti and Strocchi in J. Math. Phys. 33, 777 (1992)for the operator solution of the massless Thirring model, agrees completelywith the existence of the chirally broken phase in the massless Thirring modelrevealed in EPJC 20, 723 (2001) and hep-th/0112183, when the free masslessboson fields are described by the quantum field theory, free of infrareddivergences in 1+1-dimensional space-time, formulated in hep-th/0112184 andhep-th/0204237.
