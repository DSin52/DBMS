It is argued by Duff that only the time variation of dimensionless constantsof nature is a legitimate subject of enquiry, and that dimensional constantssuch as c, h-bar and G... are merely human constructs whose value has nooperational meaning. We refute this claim and point out that such varyingdimensional "constants" can have significant physical consequences for theuniverse that can be directly measured in experiments. Postulating thatdimensional constants vary in time can significantly change the laws ofphysics.
