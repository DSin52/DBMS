We investigate the four-dimensional supergravity theory obtained from thecompactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity on a smooth manifold of G_2holonomy. We give a new derivation for the Kaehler potential associated withthe scalar kinetic term of the N=1 four-dimensional theory. We then examinesome solutions of the four-dimensional theory which arise from wrappedM-branes.
