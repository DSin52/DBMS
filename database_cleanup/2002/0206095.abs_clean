Title: W-Infinity Algebras from Noncommutative Chern-Simons Theory

Authors: A. Pinzul and A. Stern

Comments: 9 pages

EffectWe examine Chern-Simons theory written on a noncommutative plane with a`hole', and show that the algebra of observables is a nonlinear deformation ofthe $w_\infty$ algebra. The deformation depends on the level (the coefficientin the Chern-Simons action), and the noncommutativity parameter, which wereidentified, respectively, with the inverse filling fraction and the inversedensity in a recent description of the fractional quantum Hall effect. Weremark on the quantization of our algebra. The results are sensitive to thechoice of ordering in the Gauss law.
