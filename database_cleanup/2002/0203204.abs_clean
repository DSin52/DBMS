In this paper we calculate the spectrum of Neumann matrix with zero modes inthe presence of the constant B field in Witten's cubic string field theory. Wefind both the continuous spectrum inside $[{-1\over3}, 0)$ and the constrainton the existence of the discrete spectrum. For generic $\theta$, -1/3 is not inthe discrete spectrum but in the continuous spectrum. For each eigenvalue inthe continuous spectrum there are four twist-definite degenerate eigenvectorexcept for -1/3 at which the degeneracy is two. However, for eachtwist-definite eigenvector the twist parity is opposite among the two spacetimecomponents. Based upon the result at -1/3 we prove that the ratio of branetension to be one as expected. Furthermore, we discuss the factorization ofstar algebra in the presence of B field under zero-slope limit and comment onthe implications of our results to the recent proposed map of Witten's star toMoyal's star.
