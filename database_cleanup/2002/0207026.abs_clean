We study the two-loop F^6 interactions in SO(32) heterotic superstring theoryin D=10. By using the generalized Riemann identity we are able to determine thesingle-trace part of the effective action up to a few constants which arerelated to certain scattering amplitudes. This two-loop heterotic result isrelated by duality to Type I interactions at the tree level. However, it turnsout to be completely different from any sort of non-Abelian generalization ofBorn-Infeld theory. We offer an explanation of this discrepancy.
