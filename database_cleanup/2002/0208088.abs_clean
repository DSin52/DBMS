Title: Nonperturbative Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

Authors: Vladimir Dzhunushaliev

Comments: essential changes in the text

A nonperturbative approach for spontaneous symmetry breaking is proposed. Itis based on some properties of interacting field operators. As the consequencesan additional terms like to m^2 A^2 appears in the initial Lagrangian.
