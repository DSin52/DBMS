We present classical solutions for a D5 and NS5-branes in a pp-wavebackground. The worldvolume coordinates for these branes lie along a sixdimensional pp-wave configuration obtained from $AdS_3 \times S_3$ in a Penroselimit. One in addition has nontrivial R-R 3-form field strength as well as adilaton background. Classical solutions for Dp-branes (p> 5), as well as theirbound states, are then generated in both IIA and IIB string theories by usingT-duality symmetries. We also briefly discuss the construction of Dp-branes inpp-wave backgrounds, obtained from string theories on $AdS_m\times S^m$.Finally, the construction of the above D5-brane solution is presented from thepoint of view of the Green-Schwarz worldsheet string theory and its low lyingspectrum is discussed.
