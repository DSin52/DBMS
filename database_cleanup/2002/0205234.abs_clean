We investigate the physical and mathematical structure of a new class ofgeometric transitions proposed by Aganagic and Vafa. The distinctive aspect ofthese transitions is the presence of open string instanton corrections toChern-Simons theory. We find a precise match between open and closed stringtopological amplitudes applying a beautiful idea proposed by Witten some timeago. The closed string amplitudes are reproduced from an open stringperspective as a result of a fascinating interplay of enumerative techniquesand Chern-Simons computations.
