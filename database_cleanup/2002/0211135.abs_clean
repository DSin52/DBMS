the pointing outWith the general aim to classify BPS solutions in N=2, D=5 supergravitiesinteracting with an arbitrary number of vector, tensor and hypermultiplets,here we begin considering the most general electrostatic, spherical-symmetricBPS solutions in the presence of hypermultiplet couplings. We discuss theproperties of the BPS equations and the restrictions imposed by theirintegrability conditions. We exhibit explicit solutions for the case of staticBPS black-holes coupled to one (the so called universal) hypermultiplet.
