Title: On (2+1) Dimensional Topologically Massive Non-linear Electrodynamics

Authors: M. Slusarczyk and A. Wereszczynski

Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX

The (2+1) dimensional non-linear electrodynamics, the so calledPagels--Tomboulis electrodynamics, with the Chern--Simons term is considered.We obtain "generalized self--dual equation" and find the correspondinggeneralized massive Chern--Simons Lagrangian. Similar results for (2+1) massivedilaton electrodynamics have been obtained.
