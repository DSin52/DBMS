In this paper I developed a classical model of elementary particle that isassociated with a membrane of finite size, surrounded by non-linearelectromagnetic field. The form of local interaction which lead to boundedstates of finite masses, charges and spins was constructed. To do this I addedKaluza-Klein Lagrangian on the surface, which is associated with extendedparticle, to quadratic in field potentials term (a la tachyon mass). Thisensures that Lagrangian remains an even function of the field, but spontaneoussymmetry breaking leads to nontrivial soliton-like solutions. I assumed thatthe particle has axial symmetry and that the surface has only one degree offreedom, i.e. is a disk with the radius determined from the equations ofmotion. The solution of system of two non-linear partial differential equationsfor the field potentials was obtained numerically by different methods. Severalsolutions with increasing orders of leading field multipoles and disk radiuswere obtained, and masses, electric charges and spins were calculated. In theframework of this model the ratio of a charge square to a double spin, i.e. thefine structure constant, which do not depend on parameters of the model, wascalculated.
