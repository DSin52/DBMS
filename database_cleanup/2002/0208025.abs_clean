We solve exactly the equations of motion for linearized gravity in theRandall-Sundrum model with matter on the branes and calculate the Newtonianlimit in it. The result contains contributions of the radion and of the massivemodes, which change considerably Newton's law at small distances. The effectsof "shadow" matter, which lives on the other brane, are considered and comparedwith those of ordinary matter for both positive and negative tension branes. Wealso calculate light deflection and Newton's law in the zero mode approximationand explicitly distinguish the contribution of the radion field.
