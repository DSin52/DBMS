A model of matter-coupled gravity in two dimensions is quantized. The crucialrequirement for performing the quantization is the vanishing of the conformalanomaly, which is achieved by tuning a parameter in the interaction potential.The spectrum of the theory is determined by mapping the model first onto afield theory with a Liouville interaction, then onto a linear dilaton conformalfield theory. In absence of matter fields a pure gauge theory with masslessground state is found; otherwise it is possible to minimally couple up to 11sector decouples, like the transverse oscillators in the critical bosonicstring.
