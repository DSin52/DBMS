We discuss D-dimensional scalar field interacting with a scale invariantrandom metric which is either a Gaussian field or a square of a Gaussian field.The metric depends on d-dimensional coordinates (where d is less than D). By aprojection to a lower dimensional subspace we obtain a scale invariantnon-Gaussian model of Euclidean quantum field theory in D-d or d dimensions.
