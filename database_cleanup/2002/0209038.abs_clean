We summarize our findings on the quantum moduli constraints andsuperpotentials of an infinite family of moose extensions of $n_f = n_c$ SUSYQCD. For $n_c=2$, we perform concrete calculations using traditionalintegrating out techniques as well as Intriligator's ``integrating in''technique. Checking the constraints and superpotentials in the limits ofsetting $\Lambda$'s to zero or integrating out mass terms, we find that thequantum moduli constraints are local in theory space and are equivalent to aconsistent structure of ``splitting relations'' amongst the different theories.Extending the results to arbitrary $n_c$, we show that the splitting relations,along with a set of rules for flowing from a high energy theory to a low energytheory, incorporate much of the physics of the moose chain. The relations canbe used both to simplify perturbative calculations of symmetry breaking and toincorporate nonperturbative effects. We illustrate this by analyzing an exampleof a deconstructed fifth dimension, and analyzing to what extent power-lawrunning takes place.
