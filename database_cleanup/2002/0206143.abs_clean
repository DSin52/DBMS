We investigate the influence of a uniform magnetic field on the zero-pointenergy of charged fields of two types, namely, a massive charged scalar fieldunder Dirichlet boundary conditions and a massive fermion field under MITboundary conditions. For the first, exact results are obtained, in terms ofexponentially convergent functions, and for the second, the limits for smalland for large mass are analytically obtained too. Coincidence with previouslyknown, partial result serves as a check of the procedure. For the general casein the second situation --a rather involved one-- a precise numerical analysisis performed.
