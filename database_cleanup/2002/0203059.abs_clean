Title: Confinement versus asymptotic freedom

Authors: Andrey Yu. Dubin

Comments: 13 pages

I put forward the low-energy confining asymptote of the solution $<W_{C}>$(valid for large macroscopic contours C of the size $>>1/\Lambda_{QCD}$) tothe large N Loop equation in the D=4 U(N) Yang-Mills theory with theasymptotic freedom in the ultraviolet domain. Adapting the multiscaledecomposition characteristic of the Wilsonean renormgroup, the proposed Ansatzfor the loop-average is composed in order to sew, along the lines of thebootstrap approach, the large N weak-coupling series for high-momentum modeswith the $N\to{\infty}$ limit of the recently suggested stringy representationof the 1/N strong-coupling expansion Dub4 applied to low-momentumexcitations. The resulting low-energy stringy theory can be described throughsuch superrenormalizable deformation of the noncritical Liouville string that,being devoid of ultraviolet divergences, does not possess propagating degreesof freedom at short-distance scales $<<1/{\sqrt{\sigma_{ph}}}$, where$\sigma_{ph}\sim{(\Lambda_{QCD})^{2}}$ is the physical string tension.
