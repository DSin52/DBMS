We study the dynamics of M-theory on G2 holonomy manifolds, and consider indetail the manifolds realized as the quotient of the spin bundle over S^3 bydiscrete groups. We analyse, in particular, the class of quotients where thetriality symmetry is broken. We study the structure of the moduli space,construct its defining equations and show that three different types ofclassical geometries are interpolated smoothly. We derive the N=1superpotentials of M-theory on the quotients and comment on the membraneinstanton physics. Finally, we turn on Wilson lines that break gauge symmetryand discuss some of the implications.
