We obtain an analytic approximation for the effective action of a quantumscalar field in a general static two-dimensional spacetime. We apply this tothe dilaton gravity model resulting from the spherical reduction of a massive,non-minimally coupled scalar field in the four-dimensional Schwarzschildgeometry. Careful analysis near the event horizon shows the resultingtwo-dimensional system to be regular in the Hartle-Hawking state for generalvalues of the field mass, coupling, and angular momentum, while at spatialinfinity it reduces to a thermal gas at the black-hole temperature.
