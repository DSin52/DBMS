We show that the degenerate positive-norm physical propagating fields of theopen bosonic string can be gauged to the higher rank fields at the same masslevel. As a result, their scattering amplitudes can be determined from those ofthe higher spin fields. This phenomenon arises from the existence of two typesof zero-norm states with the same Young representations as those of thedegenerate positive-norm states in the old covariant first quantized (OCFQ)spectrum. This is demonstrated by using the lowest order gauge transformationof Witten's string field theory (WSFT) up to the fourth massive level(spin-five), and is found to be consistent with conformal field theorycalculation based on the first quantized generalized sigma-model approach. Inparticular, on-shell conditions of zero-norm states in OCFQ stringy gaugetransformation are found to correspond, in a one-to-one manner, to thebackground ghost fields in off-shell gauge transformation of WSFT. Theimplication of decoupling of scalar modes on Sen's conjectures was also brieflydiscussed.
