The phase structure of the finite SU(2)xSU(2) theory with N=2 supersymmetry,broken to N=1 by mass terms for the adjoint-valued chiral multiplets, isdetermined exactly by compactifying the theory on a circle of finite radius.The exact low-energy superpotential is constructed by identifying it as alinear combination of the Hamiltonians of a certain symplectic reduction of thespin generalized elliptic Calogero-Moser integrable system. It is shown thatthe theory has four confining, two Higgs and two massless Coulomb vacua whichagrees with a simple analysis of the tree-level superpotential of thefour-dimensional theory. In each vacuum, we calculate all the condensates ofthe adjoint-valued scalars.
