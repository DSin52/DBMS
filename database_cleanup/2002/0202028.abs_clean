Authors: Edmund J Copeland

Comments: Invited talk at COSMO-01 Workshop, Rovaniemi, Finland, August 30 -

September 4, 2001We present a brief review of recent advances in string cosmology. Startingwith the Dilaton-Moduli Cosmology (known also as the Pre Big Bang), we go on toinclude the effects of axion fields and address the thorny issue of theGraceful Exit in String Cosmology. This is followed by a review of densityperturbations arising in string cosmology and we finish with a briefintroduction to the impact moving five branes can have on the Dilaton-Modulicosmological solutions.
