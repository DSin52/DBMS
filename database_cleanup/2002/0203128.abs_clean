The $Z_2$ bosonic orbifold models with compactification radius $R^2=1/2k$ areexamined in the presence of boundaries.Demanding the extended algebra characters to have definite conformaldimension and to consist of an integer sum of Virasoro characters, we arrive atthe right splitting of the partition function. This is used to derive a freefield representation of a complete, consistent set of boundary states, withoutresorting to a basis of the extended algebra Ishibashi states. Finally themodules of the extended symmetry algebra that correspond to the finitely manycharacters are identified inside the direct sum of Fock modules that constitutethe space of states of the theory.
