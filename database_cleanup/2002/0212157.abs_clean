Coimbra, Portugal, September 2002, to appear in the AIP ConferenceProceedingsThe method which allows for asymptotic expansion of the one-loop effectiveaction W=ln det A is formulated. The positively defined elliptic operator A= U+ M^2 depends on the external classical fields taking values in the Lie algebraof the internal symmetry group G. Unlike the standard method of Schwinger -DeWitt, the more general case with the nondegenerate mass matrixM=diag(m1,m2,...) is considered. The first coefficients of the new asymptoticseries are calculated and their relationship with the Seeley-DeWittcoefficients is clarified.
