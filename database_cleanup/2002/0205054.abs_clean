Title: Supersymmetric Field Theories on Noncommutative Spaces

Authors: Yoshinobu Habara

Supersymmetric field theories on noncommutative spaces are constructed. Wepresent two different representations of noncommutative space, but we canobtain supersymmetry algebla and supersymmetric Yang-Mills action independentof its representation. As a result, we will see that the action has a closerelationship with IIB matrix model.
