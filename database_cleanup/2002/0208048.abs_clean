We argue that for a large class of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories theeffective superpotential as a function of the glueball chiral superfield isexactly given by a summation of planar diagrams of the same gauge theory. Thisperturbative computation reduces to a matrix model whose action is thetree-level superpotential. For all models that can be embedded in string theorywe give a proof of this result, and we sketch an argument how to derive thismore generally directly in field theory. These results are obtained withoutassuming any conjectured dualities and can be used as a systematic method toused to compute up to n-instanton corrections. These techniques allow us to seemany non-perturbative effects, such as the Seiberg-Witten solutions of N=2theories, the consequences of Montonen-Olive S-duality in N=1* and Seiberg-likedualities for N=1 theories from a completely perturbative planar point of viewin the same gauge theory, without invoking a dual description.
