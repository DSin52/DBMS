There has been disagreement in the literature on whether the hydrogen atomspectrum receives any tree-level correction due to noncommutativity. Here weshall clarify the issue and show that indeed a general argument on thestructure of proton as a nonelementary particle leads to the appearance of suchcorrections. As a showcase, we evaluate the corrections in a simplenonrelativistic quark model with a result in agreement with the previous one wehad obtained by considering the electron moving in the external electric fieldof proton. Thus the previously obtained bound on the noncommutativityparameter, $\theta < (10^4 GeV)^{-2}$, using the Lamb shift data, remainsvalid.
