We conduct a systematic search for a viable string/M-theory cosmology,focusing on cosmologies that include an era of slow-roll inflation, after whichthe moduli are stabilized and the Universe is in a state with an acceptablysmall cosmological constant. We observe that the duality relations betweendifferent cosmological backgrounds of string/M-theory moduli space are greatlysimplified, and that this simplification leads to a truncated moduli spacewithin which possible cosmological solutions lie. We review some knownchallenges to four dimensional models in the "outer", perturbative, region ofmoduli space, and use duality relations to extend them to models of all of the(compactified) perturbative string theories and 11D supergravity, includingbrane world models. We conclude that cosmologies restricted to the outer regionare not viable, and that the most likely region of moduli space in which tofind realistic cosmology is the "central", non-perturbative region, withcoupling and compact volume both of order unity, in string units.
