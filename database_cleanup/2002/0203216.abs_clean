We find examples in string theory of locally wrapped D-branes. Theseexcitations mimic skyrmions in that they correspond to topological excitationsof the scalar fields parametrizing the brane motion in the space transverse toits world-volume. While these brane excitations appear to be point-like,evidence is provided that curvature corrections to the probe action might allowfor a delocalization of the wrapping on a scale of the order of the stringlength, therefore rendering the phenomena non-singular.
