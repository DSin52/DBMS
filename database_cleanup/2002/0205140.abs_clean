Title: Accelerated Universe from Modified Chaplygin Gas and Tachyonic Fluid

Authors: H.B. Benaoum

Comments: 11 pages, no figures

A cosmological model with an exotic fluid is investigated. We show that theequation of state of this ``modified Chaplygin'' gas can describe the currentaccelerated expansion of the universe. We then reexpress it as FRW cosmologicalmodel containing a scalar field $\phi$ and find its self--interactingpotential. Moreover motivated by recent works of Sen [sen1, sen2] andPadmanbhan [pad] on tachyon field theory, a map for this exotic fluid as anormal scalar field $\phi$ with Lagrangian ${\cal L}_{\phi} =\frac{\dot{\phi}^2}{2} - U (\phi)$ to the tachyonic field $T$ with Lagrangian${\cal L}_{T} = - V(T) \sqrt{1 - \dot{T}^2}$ is obtained.
