In three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_{3}$) with massive gaugeboson, we investigate the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the fermion self-energyin the Landau gauge and find that chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) occurs whenthe gauge boson mass $\xi$ is smaller than a finite critical value $\xi_{cv}$but is suppressed when $\xi > \xi_{cv}$. We further show that the criticalvalue $\xi_{cv}$ does not qualitatively change after considering higher ordercorrections from the wave function renormalization and vertex function. Basedon the relation between CSB and the gauge boson mass $\xi$, we give a fieldtheoretical description of the competing antiferromagnetic and superconductingorders and, in particular, the coexistence of these two orders in hightemperature superconductors. When the gauge boson mass $\xi$ is generated viainstanton effect in a compact QED$_{3}$ of massless fermions, our result showsthat CSB coexists with instanton effect in a wide region of $\xi$, which can beused to study the confinement-deconfinement phase transition.
