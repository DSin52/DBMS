We analyze the link between the occurrence of massless B-type D-branes forspecific values of moduli and monodromy around such points in the moduli space.This allows us to propose a classification of all massless B-type D-branes atany point in the moduli space of Calabi-Yau's. This classification thenjustifies a previous conjecture due to Horja for the general form of monodromy.Our analysis is based on using monodromies around points in moduli space wherea single D-brane becomes massless to generate monodromies around points wherean infinite number become massless. We discuss the various possibilities withinthe classification.
