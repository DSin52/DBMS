We analyze the emergence of a minimal length for a large class of generalizedcommutation relations, preserving commutation of the position operators andtranslation invariance as well as rotation invariance (in dimension higher thanone). We show that the construction of the maximally localized states based onsqueezed states generally fails. Rather, one must resort to a constrainedvariational principle.
