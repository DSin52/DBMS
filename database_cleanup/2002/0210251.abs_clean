We calculate the free energy, energy and entropy in the matrix quantummechanical formulation of 2D string theory in a background strongly perturbedby tachyons with the imaginary Minkowskian momentum $\pm i/R$(``Sine-Liouville'' theory). The system shows a thermodynamical behaviourcorresponding to the temperature $T=1/(2\pi R)$. We show that themicroscopically calculated energy of the system satisfies the usualthermodynamical relations and leads to a non-zero entropy.
