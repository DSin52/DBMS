Title: Scalar Field Theory in the Derivative Expansion

Authors: Gordon Chalmers

Comments: 8 pages, 1 figure

The quantum correlations of scalar fields are examined as a power series inderivatives. Recursive algebraic equations are derived and determine theamplitudes; all loop integrations are performed. This recursion contains thesame information as the usual loop expansion. The approach is pragmatic andgeneralizable to most quantum field theories.
