We study the closed and open supermembranes on the maximally supersymmetricpp-wave background. In the framework of the membrane theory, the superalgebrais calculated by using the Dirac bracket and we obtain its central extension bysurface terms. The result supports the existence of the extended objects in themembrane theory in the pp-wave limit. When the central terms are discarded, theassociated algebra completely agrees with that of Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastasematrix model. We also discuss the open supermembranes on the pp-wave andelaborate the possible boundary conditions.
