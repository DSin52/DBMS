A new model for monopole catalysis of nucleon decay is proposed. Unlike inthe earlier one, the only light fields in this model are the photon and Skyrme(pion) field. The model admits the 't Hooft- Polyakov monopole and Skyrmion asclassical solutions, while baryon number non-conservation occurs through ananomaly involving an intermediate mass axial vector field resembling W- andZ-bosons. By considering spherically symmetric monopole-Skyrmionconfigurations, we find that the Skyrmion looses essentially all its mass wheninteracting with the monopole, which is phenomenologically identical to themonopole catalysis of nucleon decay. Short-distance monopole-Skyrmion physicsin this model is interesting too, as there exist almost degenerate metastablemonopole-Skyrmion bound states separated by substantial energy barriers. Yetthe heights of the latter are much smaller than the physical nucleon mass, sothe complete disappearance of the normal undeformed Skyrmion remains perfectlypossible in Skyrmion-monopole scattering.
