enlargedA deformation of the canonical algebra for kinematical observables of thequantum field theory in Minkowski space-time has been considered under thecondition of Lorentz invariance. A relativistic invariant algebra obtaineddepends on additional fundamental constants M, L and H with the dimensions ofmass, length and action, respectively. In some limiting cases the algebra goesover into the well-known Snyder or Yang algebras. In general case the algebrarepresents a class of Lie algebras, that consists of simple algebras andsemidirect sums of simple algebras and integrable ones. Some algebras belongingto this class are noninvariant under T and C transformations. Possibleapplications of obtained algebras for descriptions of states of matter underextreme conditions are briefly discussed.
