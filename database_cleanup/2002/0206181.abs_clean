Title: Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics and Geometry from the Quantization of

C-spacesComments: 16 pages, Revised Latex file. Important Corrections in Section 2 are

madeFour years ago the Extended Scale Relativity (ESR) theory in C-spaces(Clifford manifolds) was proposed as the plausible physical foundations ofstring theory. In such theory the speed of light and the minimum Planck scaleare the two universal invariants. All the dimensions of a C-space can betreated on equal footing by implementing the holographic principle associatedwith a nested family of p-loops of various dimensionalities. This is achievedby using polyvector valued coordinates in C-spaces that encode in one strokepoints, lines, areas, volumes,.....We review the derivation of the minimallength/time string/brane uncertainty relations and the maximum Plancktemperature thermodynamical uncertainty relation. The Weyl-Heisenberg algebrain C-spaces is constructed which $induces$ a Noncommutative Geometric structurein the $ X^A $ coordinates. Hence quantization in C-spaces involves in anatural fashion a Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics and Field Theory, ratherthan being postulated ad-hoc. A QFT in C-spaces may very likely involve(Braided Hopf) Quantum Clifford algebras and generalized Moyal-like starproducts associated with multisymplectic geometry.
