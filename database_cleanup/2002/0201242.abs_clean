Title: Supersymmetric Classical Mechanics

Authors: R. de Lima Rodrigues, W. Pires de Almeida and I. Fonseca Neto

Comments: 13 pages, no figures

We present a review work on Supersymmetric Classical Mechanics in the contextof a Lagrangian formalism, with $N=1-$supersymmetry. We show that the N=1supersymmetry does not allow the introduction of a potential energy termdepending on a single commuting supercoordinate, $\phi (t;\Theta)$.
