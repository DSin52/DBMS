BPS equations and wall solutions are studied keeping (part of) supersymmetry(SUSY) manifest. Using N=1 superfields, massive hyper-Kahler quotient isintroduced to obtain massive N=2 (8 SUSY) nonlinear sigma models in fourdimensions with T*CP(n) target manifold, which yield BPS wall solutions for then=1 case. We also describe massive hyper-Kahler quotient of T*CP(n) by usingthe harmonic superspace formalism which preserves all SUSY manifestly, and BPSequations and wall solutions are obtained in the n=1 case.
