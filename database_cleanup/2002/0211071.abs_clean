We examine the corrections to the lowest order gravitational interactions ofmassive particles arising from gravitational radiative corrections. We show howthe masslessness of the graviton and the gravitational self interactions implythe presence of nonanalytic pieces sqrt{-q^2}, ln-q^2, etc. in the form factorsof the energy-momentum tensor and that these correspond to long rangemodifications of the metric tensor g_{\mu\nu} of the form G^2m^2/r^2,G^2m\hbar/r^3, etc. The former coincide with well known solutions fromclassical general relativity, while the latter represent new quantum mechanicaleffects, whose strength and form is necessitated by the low energy quantumnature of the general relativity. We use these results to define a runninggravitational charge.
