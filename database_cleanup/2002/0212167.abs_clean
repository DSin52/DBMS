We show how one can get solitonic strings in a six-dimensional (2,0)supersymmetric theory by incorporating a nonlinear interaction term. We derivea zero force condition between parallel strings, and compute a metric on amoduli space which is $R^4$ when the strings are far apart. When compactifyingthe strings on a two-torus we show that, in the limit of vanishing two-torus,one regains the moduli space of two widely separated dyons of equal magneticcharges in four dimensions.
