We discuss recent results on one-loop contributions to the effective actionin {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions.Contributions with five external vector fields are compared with correspondingones in open superstring theory in order to understand the relation with theF^5 terms that appear in the nonabelian generalization of the Born-Infeldaction.
