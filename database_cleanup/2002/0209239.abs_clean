A tubular D3-brane with electromagnetic flux is considered. It is verifiedthat the quantized electric and magnetic charges are the F-string and D-stringcharges of the brane, respectively. The D3-brane with parallel electric andmagnetic fields collapses to the bound state of strings. A D3-brane withnonzero Poynting vector can be viewed as expanded FD strings. A fundamentalstring is viewed as a collapsed D3-brane and mapped to the (n,m) strings viaelectric-magnetic duality rotations. This mapping is the same as a weak-strongduality transformation and therefore reveals the equivalence of theelectric-magnetic and weak-strong dualities.
