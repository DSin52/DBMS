We analyze the structure of the imaginary part of the two-loopEuler-Heisenberg QED effective Lagrangian for a constant self-dual background.The novel feature of the two-loop result, compared to one-loop, is that theprefactor of each exponential (instanton) term in the imaginary part has itselfan asymptotic expansion. We also perform a high-precision test of Borelsummation techniques applied to the weak-field expansion, and find that theBorel dispersion relations reproduce the full prefactor of the leadingimaginary contribution.
