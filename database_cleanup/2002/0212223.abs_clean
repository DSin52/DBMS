We study string theory in supersymmetric time-dependent backgrounds. In theframework of general relativity, supersymmetry for spacetimes without fluximplies the existence of a covariantly constant null vector, and a relativelysimple form of the metric. As a result, the local nature of any such spacetimecan be easily understood. We show that we can view any such geometry as asequence of solutions to lower-dimensional Euclidean gravity. If we choose thelower-dimensional solutions to degenerate at some light-cone time, we obtainnull singularities, which may be thought of as generalizations of the parabolicorbifold singularity. We find that in string theory, many such nullsingularities get repaired by $\alpha'$-corrections - in particular, byworldsheet instantons. As a consequence, the resulting string theory solutionsdo not suffer from any instability. Even though the CFT description of thesesolutions is not always valid, they can still be well understood after takingthe effects of light D-branes into account; the breakdown of the worldsheetconformal field theory is purely gauge-theoretic, not involving stronggravitational effects.
