The number of asymptotically de Sitter (non-singular) solutions of 5ddilatonic gravity with positive cosmological constant is found. These solutionsare similar to the previously known asymptotically AdS spaces where dilaton maygenerate the singularity. Using these solutions the consistent $c$-function isproposed in the same way as in AdS/CFT. The consistency of RG flow givesfurther support for dS/CFT correspondence. From holographic RG flow equationswe calculate the holographic 4d conformal anomaly with dilatonic contributions.This conformal anomaly turns out to be the same as in AdS/CFT correspondence.
