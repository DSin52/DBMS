Johns Hopkins Workshop on Current Problems in Particle TheoryField theories on canonical noncommutative spacetimes, which are beingstudied also in connection with string theory, and on $\kappa$-Minkowskispacetime, which is a popular example of Lie-algebra noncommutative spacetime,can be naturally constructed by introducing a suitable generating functionalfor Green functions in energy-momentum space. Direct reference to a starproduct is not necessary. It is sufficient to make use of the simple propertiesthat the Fourier transform preserves in these spacetimes and establish therules for products of wave exponentials that are dictated by thenon-commutativity of the coordinates. The approach also provides an elementarydescription of "planar" and "non-planar" Feynman diagrams. We also comment onthe rich phenomenology emerging from the analysis of these theories.
