A first principle derivation is given of the neutrino damping rate inreal-time thermal field theory. Starting from the discontinuity of the neutrinoself energy at the two loop level, the damping rate can be expressed asintegrals over space phase of amplitudes squared, weighted with statisticalfactors that account for the possibility of particle absorption or emissionfrom the medium. Specific results for a background composed of neutrinos,leptons, protons and neutrons are given. Additionally, for the real part of thedispersion relation we discuss the relation between the results obtained fromthe thermal field theory, and those obtained by the thermal average of theforward scattering amplitude.
