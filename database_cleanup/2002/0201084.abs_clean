A method for describing the quantum kink states in the semi-classical limitof several (1+1)-dimensional field theoretical models is developed. We use thegeneralized zeta function regularization method to compute the one-loop quantumcorrection to the masses of the kink in the sine-Gordon and cubic sinh-Gordonmodels and another two ${\rm P}(\phi)_2$ systems with polynomialself-interactions.
