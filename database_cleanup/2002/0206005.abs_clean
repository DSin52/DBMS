Recently it has been proposed that the coefficient of the three-pointfunction of the BMN operators in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory isrelated to the three-string interactions in the pp-wave background. Wecalculate three-point functions of these operators to the first order in theeffective Yang-Mills coupling lambda' = g_{YM}^2 N/J^2 in planar perturbationtheory. On the string theory side, we derive the explicit expressions of theNeumann matrices to all orders in 1/(\mu p^+ \alpha')^2. This allows us tocompute the corresponding three-string scattering amplitudes. This provides anall orders prediction for the field theory three-point functions. We compareour field theory results with the string theory results to the subleading orderin 1/(\mu p^+ \alpha')^2 and find perfect agreement.
