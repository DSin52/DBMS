We consider self tuning solutions for a brane embedded in an anti de Sitterspacetime. We include the higher derivative Gauss-Bonnet terms in the actionand study singularity free solutions with finite effective Newton's constant.Using the methods of Csaki et al, we prove that such solutions, when exist,always require a fine tuning among the brane parameters. We then present a newmethod of analysis in which the qualitative features of the solutions can beseen easily without obtaining the solutions explicitly. Also, the origin of thefine tuning is transparent in this method.
