Title: Noncommutative geometry and the classical orbits of particles in a

central force potentialAuthors: B. Mirza, M. Dehghani

We investigate the effect of the noncommutative geometry on the classicalorbits of particles in a central force potential. The relation is implementedthrough the modified commutation relations $[x_i, x_j]=i \theta_{ij} $.Comparison with observation places severe constraints on the value of thenoncommutativity parameter.
