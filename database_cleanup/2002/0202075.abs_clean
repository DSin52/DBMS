We obtain singularity resolutions for various overlapping braneconfigurations, including those of two heterotic 5-branes, type II 5-branes orD4-branes. In these solutions, the ``harmonic'' function H for each branecomponent depends only on the associated four-dimensional relative transversespace. The resolution is achieved by replacing these transverse spaces withEguchi-Hanson or Taub-NUT spaces, both of which admit a normalisable self-dual(or anti-self-dual) harmonic 2-form. Due to the manner in which the interactionterms for the form fields modify their Bianchi identities or equations ofmotion, these normalisable harmonic 2-forms provide regular sources for thebranes. We also obtain resolved 5-branes and D4-branes wrapped on S^1, which isfibred over the transverse Eguchi-Hanson or Taub-NUT spaces. The T-dualityinvariance of the NS-NS 5-brane is retained after the resolution. The resolved5-branes and D4-branes provide regular supergravity duals of certainsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in five and four dimensions.
