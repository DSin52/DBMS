Institute on Elementary Particle PhysicsThe physical world is marked by the phenomenon of spontaneous broken symmetry(SBS) i.e. where the state of a system is assymmetric with respect to thesymmetry principles that govern its dynamics. For material systems this is notsurprising since more often than not energetic considerations dictate that theground state or low lying excited states of many body system become orderedi.e. a collective variable, such as magnetization or the Fourier transform ofthe density of a solid, picks up expectation values which otherwise wouldvanish by virtue of the dynamical symmetry(isotropy or translational symmetryin the aforementioned examples). More surprising was the discovery of the roleof SBS in describing the vacuum or low lyng excitations of a quantum fieldtheory. First came spontaneously broken chiral symmetry which was then appliedto soft pion physics. When combined with current algebra, this field dominatedparticle physics in the 60's. Then came the application of the notion of SBS tosituations where the symmetry is locally implemented by gauge fields. In thatcase the concept of order becomes more subtle. This development lead the way toelectroweak unification and it remains one of the principal tools of thetheorist in the quest for physics beyond the standard model. This brief reviewis intended to span the history of SBS with emphasis on conceptual rather thanquantitative content. It is a written version of lectures of R.Brout on the``Paleolithic Age'' and on ``Modern Times'' by F.Englert, i.e. respectivelywithout and with gauge fields.
