We describe the low-energy effective theory of N=1 spontaneously brokensupegravity obtained by flux-induced breaking in the presence of n D3 branes.This theory can be obtained by integrating out three massive gravitinomultiplets in the hierarchical breaking N=4 to N=3 to N=2 to N=1. Thisintegration also eliminates the IIB complex dilaton. The resulting theory is ano-scale supergravity model, whose moduli are the three chiral multiplets thatcorrespond to the three radii of the three 2-tori in 6-torus, together with the6n brane coordinates. The U(n) gauge interactions on the branes respect theno-scale structure,and the N=1 goldstino is the fermionic partner of the6-torus volume.
