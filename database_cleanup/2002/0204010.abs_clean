Title: Topological charge and topological susceptibility in connection with

translation and gauge invarianceAuthors: A.M. Kotzinian, O.Yu. Shevchenko, A.N. Sissakian (Dubna, JINR)

It is shown that the evaluation of the expectation value (EV) of topologicalcharge density over $\theta$-vacuum is reduced to investigation of theChern-Simons term EV. An equation for this quantity is established and solved.EV of the topological charge density at an arbitrary $\theta$ occurs equal tozero and, as a consequence, topological susceptibility of both QCD and pureYang-Mills vacua defined in a Wick sense is equal to zero, whereas when definedin a Dyson sense it differs from zero by the quantity proportional to therespective condensate of the chromomagnetic field. Thus, the usualWitten-Veneziano formula for the $\eta^{'}$ meson mass is modified.
