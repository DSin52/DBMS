We derive the corrections to the Friedmann equation of order rho^2 in theRandall-Sundrum (RS) model, where two 3-branes bound a slice offive-dimensional Anti-deSitter space. The effects of radion stabilization bythe Goldberger-Wise mechanism are taken into account. Surprisingly, we findthat an inflaton on either brane will experience no order rho^2 corrections inthe Hubble rate H due to its own energy density, although an observer on theopposite brane does see such a correction. Thus there is no enhancement of theslow-roll condition unless inflation is simultaneously driven by inflatons onboth branes. Similarly, during radiation domination, the rho^2 correction to Hon a given brane vanish unless there is nonvanishing energy density on theopposite brane. During the electroweak phase transition the correction can belarge, but is has the wrong sign for causing sphalerons to go out of thermalequilibrium, so it cannot help electroweak baryogenesis. We discuss thedifferences between our results and exact solutions in RS-II cosmology.
