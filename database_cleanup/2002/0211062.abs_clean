We show that the recently obtained class of spacetimes for which all of thescalar curvature invariants vanish (which can be regarded as generalizations ofpp-wave spacetimes) are exact solutions in string theory to all perturbativeorders in the string tension scale. As a result the spectrum of the theory canbe explicitly obtained, and these spacetimes are expected to provide some hintsfor the study of superstrings on more general backgrounds. Since theseLorentzian spacetimes suffer no quantum corrections to all loop orders they mayalso offer insights into quantum gravity.
