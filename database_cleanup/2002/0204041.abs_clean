We analyze the Scherk-Schwarz (SS) supersymmetry breaking in brane-world fivedimensional theories compactified on the orbifold $S^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$. The SSbreaking parameter is undetermined at the tree-level (no-scale supergravity)and can be interpreted as the Hosotani vacuum expectation value correspondingto the $U(1)_R$ group in five dimensional N=2 (ungauged) supergravity. We showthat the SS breaking parameter is fixed at the loop level to either 0 or 1/2depending on the matter content propagating in the bulk but in a rathermodel-independent way. Supersymmetry breaking is therefore fixed through aradiative Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. We also show that the two discrete valuesof the SS parameter, as well as the supersymmetry breaking shift in thespectrum of the bulk fields, are altered in the presence of a brane-localizedsupersymmetry breaking arising from some hidden sector dynamics. The interplaybetween the SS and the brane localized breaking is studied in detail.
