We propose an effective description of 0-brane black holes, in which theblack hole is modeled as a gas of non-interacting quasi-particles in the dualquantum mechanics. This simple model is shown to account for many of the staticthermodynamic properties of the black hole. It also accounts for dynamicalproperties, such as the rate at which energy gets thermalized by the blackhole. We use the model to show that the entropy of the quantum mechanics isproportional to the black hole horizon area in Planck units.
