Title: Deformed Lorentz Symmetry and High-Energy Astrophysics (II)

Comments: 9 pages, updated comment to three contributions to the ICRC 2001

ConferenceLorentz symmetry violation (LSV) can be generated at the Planck scale, or atsome other fundamental length scale, and naturally preserve Lorentz symmetry asa low-energy limit (deformed Lorentz symmetry, DLS). DLS can have importantimplications for ultra-high energy cosmic-ray physics (see papersphysics/0003080, astro-ph/0011181 and astro-ph/0011182, and references quotedin these papers). A crucial question is how DLS can be extended to a deformedPoincare symmetry (DPS), and what can be the dynamical origin of thisphenomenon. We discuss recent proposals to identify DPS with a symmetryincorporating the Planck scale (doubly special relativity, DSR) and suggest newways in this direction. Implications for models of quadratically deformedrelativistic kinematics (QDRK) and linearly deformed relativistic kinematics(LDRK) are also discussed.
