We argue that it may be possible to reheat the universe after inflationdriven by D-brane annihilation, due to the coupling of massless fields to thetime-dependent tachyon condensate which describes the annihilation process.This mechanism can work if the original branes annihilate to a stable branecontaining the standard model. Given reasonable assumptions about the shape ofthe tachyon background configuration and the size of the relevant extradimension, the reheating can be efficient enough to overcome the problem of theuniverse being perpetually dominated by cold dark tachyon matter. Inparticular, reheating is most efficient when the final brane codimension islarge, and when the derivatives of the tachyon background are large.
