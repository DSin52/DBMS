We consider the set of controlled time-dependent backgrounds of generalrelativity and string theory describing ``bubbles of nothing'', obtained viadouble analytic continuation of black hole solutions. We analyze their quantumstability, uncover some novel features of their dynamics, identify their causalstructure and observables, and compute their particle production spectrum. Wepresent a general relation between squeezed states, such as those arising incosmological particle creation, and nonlocal theories on the string worldsheet.The bubble backgrounds have various aspects in common with de Sitter space,Rindler space, and moving mirror systems, but constitute controlled solutionsof general relativity and string theory with no external forces. They provide auseful theoretical laboratory for studying issues of observables in systemswith cosmological horizons, particle creation, and time-dependent stringperturbation theory.
