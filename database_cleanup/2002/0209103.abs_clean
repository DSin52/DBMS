Title: A note on the perturbative properties of BPS operators

Authors: Gleb Arutyunov and Emery Sokatchev

We discuss the perturbative behavior of the 1/2 BPS operators in N=2 SCFT onthe example of two very similar quadrilinear composite operators made out ofhypermultiplets. An explicit one-loop computation shows that one of them isprotected while the other acquires an anomalous dimension. Although bothoperators are superconformal primaries in the free case, the quantumcorrections make the latter become a 1/2 BPS descendant of the Konishimultiplet, while the former remains primary. The comparative study of these twooperators at higher orders may be helpful in understanding the quantumproperties of the Konishi multiplet.
