Gravitational S-duality is defined by the contraction of two indices of theRiemann tensor with the epsilon tensor. We review its realization in linearizedgravity, and study its generalization to full non-linear gravity by means ofTaub-NUT-Schwarzschild metrics by interchanging m with l, provided bothparameters are non-zero. In the presence of a cosmological constantgravitational S-duality can be implemented at the expense of the introductionof a three-form field whose value turns out to be dual to the cosmologicalconstant.
