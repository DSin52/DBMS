We consider classical solutions for strings ending on magnetically chargedblack holes in four-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory. We examine the classicalsuperstring and the global vortex, which can be viewed as a nonsingular modelfor the superstring. We show how both of these can end on a Kaluza-Kleinmonopole in the absence of self-gravity. Including gravitational back-reactiongives rise to a confinement mechanism of the magnetic flux of the black holealong the direction of the string. We discuss the relation of this work tolocalized solutions in ten dimensional supergravity.
