We study the superstring vacua constructed from the conformal field theoriesof the type H_4 x M, where H_4 denotes the super Nappi-Witten model (super WZWmodel on the 4-dimensional Heisenberg group H_4) and M denotes an arbitrary N=2rational superconformal field theory with c=9. We define (type II) superstringvacua with 8 supercharges, which are twice as many as those on the backgroundsof H_4 x CY_3. We explicitly construct as physical vertices the space-time SUSYalgebra that is a natural extension of H_4 Lie algebra. The spectrum ofalong the transverse plane of pp-wave geometry and possessing the integralU(1)_R-charges in M sector, and (2) strings that do not freely propagate alongthe transverse plane and possess the fractional U(1)_R-charges in M. The formerbehaves like the string excitations in the usual Calabi-Yau compactification,but the latter defines new sectors without changing the physics in ``bulk''space. We also analyze the thermal partition functions of these systems,emphasizing the similarity to the DLCQ string theory. As a byproduct we provethe supersymmetric cancellation of conformal blocks in an arbitrary unitary N=2SCFT of c=12 with the suitable GSO projection.
