We comment on the conformal boundary states of the c=1 free boson theory on acircle which do not preserve the U(1) symmetry. We construct these Virasoroboundary states at a generic radius by a simple asymmetric shift orbifoldacting on the fundamental boundary states at the self-dual radius. We furthercalculate the boundary entropy and find that the Virasoro boundary states atirrational radius have infinite boundary entropy. The corresponding open stringdescription of the asymmetric orbifold is given using the quotient algebraconstruction. Moreover, we find that the quotient algebra associated with anon-fundamental boundary state contains the noncommutative Weyl algebra.
