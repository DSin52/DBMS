Froissart boundAuthors: Steven B. Giddings

High-energy scattering in non-conformal gauge theories is investigated usingthe AdS/CFT dual string/gravity theory. It is argued that strong-gravityprocesses, such as black hole formation, play an important role in the dualdynamics. Further information about this dynamics is found by performing alinearized analysis of gravity for a mass near an infrared brane; this givesthe far field approximation to black hole or other strong-gravity effects, andin particular allows us to estimate their shape. From this shape, one can infera total scattering cross-section that grows with center of mass energy as ln^2E, saturating the Froissart bound.
