The zeta-function regularization method is used to evaluate the renormalizedeffective action for massless conformally coupling scalar field propagating ina closed Friedman spacetime perturbed by a small rotation. To the second orderof the rotational parameter in the model spacetime the analytic form of theeffective action is obtained with the help of the Schwinger perturbationformula. After investigating the time evolution of the rotational parameter wefind that the quantum field effect can produce an effect which damps thecosmological rotational in the early universe.
