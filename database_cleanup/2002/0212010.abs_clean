Comments: 27 pages. Typo fixed. Comments and refrence added

In this paper, we give a proof of the equivalence of ${\cal N}=1$ $SO/Sp$gauge theories deformed from ${\cal N}=2$ by the superpotential of adjointfield $\Phi$ and the dual type IIB superstring theory on CY threefoldgeometries with fluxes and orientifold action after geometric transition.Furthermore, by relating the geometric picture to the matrix model, we show theequivalence among the field theory and the corresponding matrix model.
