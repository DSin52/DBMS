We extend the path-integral formalism for Poisson-Lie T-duality to includethe case of Drinfeld doubles which can be decomposed into bi-algebras in morethan one way. We give the correct shift of the dilaton, correcting a mistake inthe litterature. We then use the fact that the six dimensional Drinfeld doubleshave been classified to write down all possible conformal Poisson-Lie T-dualsof three dimensional space times and we explicitly work out two duals to theconstant dilaton and zero anti-symmetric tensor Bianchi type V space time andshow that they satisfy the string equations of motion. This space-time waspreviously thought to have no duals because of the tracefulness of thestructure constants.
