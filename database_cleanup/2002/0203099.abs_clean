We investigate the possible effects on the evolution of perturbations in theinflationary epoch due to short distance physics. We introduce a suitable nonlocal action for the inflaton field, suggested by Noncommutative Geometry, andobtained by adopting a generalized star product on a Friedmann-Robertson-Walkerbackground. In particular, we study how the presence of a length scale wherespacetime becomes noncommutative affects the gaussianity and isotropyproperties of fluctuations, and the corresponding effects on the CosmicMicrowave Background spectrum.
