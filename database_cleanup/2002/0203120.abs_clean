We consider supersymmetric theories with a warped extra dimension wheresupersymmetry is broken by boundary conditions that preserve an R-symmetry. Itis shown that this supersymmetry breaking mechanism naturally invokes theStuckelberg formalism for the gravitino in order to give a four-dimensionaltheory with a smooth massless limit.
