Title: On The Quantization Of Constraint Systems

Authors: F. Loran

Comments: 9 pages, no figures

It is possible to introduce external time dependent back ground fields in theformulation of a system as fields whose dynamics can not be deduced from EulerLagrange equations of motion. This method leads to singular Lagrangians forreal systems. We discuss quantization of constraint systems in these cases andintroduce generalized Gupta-Bleuler quantization. In two examples we showexplicitly that this method of quantization leads to true Schr\"{o}dingerequations.
