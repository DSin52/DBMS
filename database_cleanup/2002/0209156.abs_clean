We discuss issues relating to the topology of Euclidean de Sitter space. Weshow that in (2+1) dimensions, the Euclidean continuation of the`causaldiamond', i.e the region of spacetime accessible to a timelike observer, is athree-hemisphere. However, when de Sitter entropy is computed in a `stretchedhorizon' picture, then we argue that the correct Euclidean topology is a solidtorus. The solid torus shrinks and degenerates into a three-hemisphere as onegoes from the `stretched horizon' to the horizon, giving the Euclideancontinuation of the causal diamond. We finally comment on the generalisation ofthese results to higher dimensions.
