IOP Publishing House, Bristol, 2002We discuss the nonlinear transformations of standard Poincar\'{e} symmetry inthe context of recently introduced Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) theories. Weintroduce four classes of modified relativistic theories with three of themdescribing various DSR frameworks. We consider four examples of modifiedrelativistic symmetries, which illustrate each of the considered class.
