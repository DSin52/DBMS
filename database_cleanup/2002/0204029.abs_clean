A class of black objects which are solutions of pure gravity with negativecosmological constant are classified through the mapping between the Killingspinors of the ground state and those of the transverse section. It is shownthat these geometries must have transverse sections of constant curvature forspacetime dimensions d below seven. For d > 6, the transverse sections can alsobe Euclidean Einstein manifolds. In even dimensions, spacetimes with transversesection of nonconstant curvature exist only in d = 8 and 10. Thisclassification goes beyond standard supergravity and the eleven dimensionalcase is analyzed. It is shown that if the transverse section has negativescalar curvature, only extended objects can have a supersymmetric ground state.In that case, some solutions are explicitly found whose ground state resemblesa wormhole.
