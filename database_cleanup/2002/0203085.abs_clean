Two different kinds of interactions between a ${Z}_{n}$-parafermionic and aLiouville field theory are considered. For generic values of $n$, the effectivecentral charges describing the UV behavior of both models are calculated in theNeveu-Schwarz sector. For $n=2$ exact vacuum expectation values of primaryfields of the Liouville field theory, as well as the first descendent fieldsare proposed. For $n=1$, known results for Sinh-Gordon and Bullough-Dodd modelsare recovered whereas for $n=2$, exact results for these two integrable coupledIsing-Liouville models are shown to exchange under a weak-strong couplingduality relation. In particular, exact relations between the parameters in theactions and the mass of the particles are obtained. At specific imaginaryvalues of the coupling and $n=2$, we use previous results to obtain exacthomogeneous sine-Gordon model $SU(3)_2$ or the Ising-XY model; (b)Neveu-Schwarz sector of the $\Phi_{13}$ integrable perturbation of N=1supersymmetric minimal models. Several non-perturbative checks are done, whichsupport the exact results.
