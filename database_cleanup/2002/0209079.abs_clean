A quantum theory of gravity is described in the case of a positivecosmological constant in 3+1 dimensions. Both old and new results aredescribed, which support the case that loop quantum gravity provides asatisfactory quantum theory of gravity. These include the existence of a groundstate, discoverd by Kodama, which both is an exact solution to the constraintsof quantum gravity and has a semiclassical limit which is deSitter spacetime.The long wavelength excitations of this state are studied and are shown toreproduce both gravitons and, when matter is included, quantum field theory ondeSitter spacetime. Furthermore, one may derive directly from theWheeler-deWitt equation, Planck scale, computable corrections to theenergy-momentum relations for matter fields. This may lead in the next fewyears to experimental tests of the theory.To study the excitations of the Kodama state exactly requires the use of thespin network representation, which is quantum deformed due to the cosmologicalconstant. The theory may be developed within a single horizon, and the boundarystates described exactly in terms of a boundary Chern-Simons theory. TheBekenstein bound is recovered and the N bound of Banks is given a backgroundindependent explanation.The paper is written as an introduction to loop quantum gravity, requiring noprior knowledge of the subject. The deep relationship between quantum gravityand topological field theory is stressed throughout.
