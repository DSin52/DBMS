Title: Computation of the Chiral Anomaly in the Bulk Quantization

Authors: Thomas Klose and Sorin Marculescu

Comments: 19 pages

The bulk quantization method is used for regularizing a conventional fourdimensional theory of massless fermions coupled to an external non-Abeliangauge field and for subsequently evaluating the associated Ward identity. As aresult one obtains the well-known chiral anomaly.
