Title: AdS Duals of Matrix Strings

Authors: Jose F.Morales and Henning Samtleben

Comments: 7 pages, Proceedings of the RTN workshop ``The quantum structure of

spacetime and the geometric nature of fundamental interactions'', Leuven,September 2002We review recent work on the holographic duals of type II and heteroticmatrix string theories described by warped AdS_3 supergravities. In particular,we compute the spectra of Kaluza-Klein primaries for type I, II supergravitieson warped AdS_3xS^7 and match them with the primary operators in the dualtwo-dimensional gauge theories. The presence of non-trivial warp factors anddilaton profiles requires a modification of the familiar dictionary betweenmasses and ``scaling'' dimensions of fields and operators. We present thesemodifications for the general case of domain wall/QFT correspondences betweensupergravities on warped AdS_{d+1}xS^q geometries and super Yang-Mills theorieswith 16 supercharges.
