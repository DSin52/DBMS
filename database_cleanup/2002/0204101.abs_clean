By studying singularities in stationary axisymmetric Kerr and Tomimatsu-Satosolutions with distortion parameter \d = 2, 3, ... in general relativity, weconclude that these singularities can be regarded as nothing other than closedstring-like circular mass distributions. We use two different regularizationsto identify \d-function type singularities in the energy-momentum tensor forthese solutions, realizing a regulator independent result. This result givessupporting evidence that these axisymmetric exact solutions may well be theclassical solutions around closed string-like mass distributions, just likeSchwarzschild solution corresponding to a point mass distribution. In otherwords, these axisymmetric exact solutions may well provide the classicalbackgrounds around closed strings.
