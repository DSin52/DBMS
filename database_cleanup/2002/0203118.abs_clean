detailsTwo-loop $\beta$-function and anomalous dimension are calculated for N=1supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics, regularized by higher derivatives inthe minimal subtraction scheme. The result for two-loop contribution to the$\beta$-function appears to be equal to 0, does not depend on the form ofregularizing term and does not lead to anomaly puzzle. Two-loop anomalousdimension can be also made independent on parameters of higher derivativeregularization by a special choice of subtraction scheme.
