Title: Enhanced gauge symmetry from `toric' G_2 cones

Authors: L. Anguelova, C.I. Lazaroiu

Comments: 12 pages, 3 figures

We review our recent work on M-theory compactifications on `toric' G_2 cones,a class of models which generalize those recently considered by Acharya andWitten and lead to chiral matter in four dimensions. We explain our criteriafor identifying the gauge group content of such theories and briefly discussthe associated metrics.
