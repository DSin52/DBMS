Branched n-coverings of Riemann surfaces are described by a 2d lattice gaugetheory of the symmetric group S(n) defined on a cell discretization of thesurface. We study the theory in the large-n limit, and we find a rich phasediagram with first and second order transition lines. The various phases arecharacterized by different connectivity properties of the covering surface. Wepoint out some interesting connections with the theory of random walks on groupmanifolds and with random graph theory.
