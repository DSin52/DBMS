We study the the properties of a BRST ghost degree of freedom complementaryto a two-state spinor. We show that the ghost may be regarded as a unit carrierof negative entropy. We construct an irreducible representation of the su(2)Lie algebra with negative spin, equal to -1/2, on the ghost state space anddiscuss the representation of finite SU(2) group elements. The Casimir operatorJ^2 of the combined spinor-ghost system is nilpotent and coincides with theBRST operator Q. Using this, we discuss the sense in which the positive andnegative spin representations cancel in the product to give an effectivelytrivial representation. We compute an effective dimension, equal to 1/2, andcharacter for the ghost representation and argue that these are consistent withthis cancellation.
