N-fold tensor products of a rational CFT carry an action of the permutationgroup S_N. These automorphisms can be used as gluing conditions in the study ofboundary conditions for tensor product theories. We present an ansatz for suchpermutation boundary states and check that it satisfies the cluster conditionand Cardy's constraints. For a particularly simple case, we also investigateassociativity of the boundary OPE, and find an intriguing connection with thebulk OPE. In the second part of the paper, the constructions are slightlyextended for application to Gepner models. We give permutation branes for thequintic, together with some formulae for their intersections.
