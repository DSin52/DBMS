In spacetime dimensions larger than 2, whenever a global symmetry G isspontaneously broken to a subgroup H, and G and H are Lie groups, there areNambu-Goldstone modes described by fields with values in G/H. Intwo-dimensional spacetimes as well, models where fields take values in G/H areof considerable interest even though in that case there is no spontaneousbreaking of continuous symmetries. We consider such models when the world sheetis a two-sphere and describe their fuzzy analogues for G=SU(N+1),H=S(U(N-1)xU(1)) ~ U(N) and G/H=CP^N. More generally our methods give fuzzyversions of continuum models on S^2 when the target spaces are Grassmanniansand flag manifolds described by (N+1)x(N+1) projectors of rank =< (N+1)/2.These fuzzy models are finite-dimensional matrix models which neverthelessretain all the essential continuum topological features like solitonic sectors.They seem well-suited for numerical work.
