Recently spatially localized anomalies have been considered in higherdimensional field theories. The question of the quantum consistency andstability of these theories needs further discussion. Here we would like toinvestigate what string theory might teach us about theories with localizedanomalies. We consider the Z_3 orbifold of the heterotic E_8 x E_8 theory, andcompute the anomaly of the gaugino in the presence of Wilson lines. We find ananomaly localized at the fixed points, which depends crucially on the localuntwisted spectra at those points. We show that non-Abelian anomalies cancellocally at the fixed points for all Z_3 models with or without additionalWilson lines. At various fixed points different anomalous U(1)s may be present,but at most one at a given fixed point. It is in general not possible toconstruct one generator which is the sole source of the anomalous U(1)s at thevarious fixed points.
