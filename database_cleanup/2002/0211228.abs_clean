Symposium, 2002We present important elements of a gauge and diffeomorphism invariantformulation of the moduli space approximation to soliton dynamics. We arguethat explicit velocity-dependent modifications are determined entirely fromgauge and diffeomorphism invariance. We illustrate the formalism for the caseof a Yang-Mills theory on a curved spacetime background.
