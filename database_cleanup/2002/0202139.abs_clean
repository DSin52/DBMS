The reparametrization symmetries of Witten's vertex in ordinary or vacuumstring field theories can be used to extract useful information about classicalsolutions of the equations of motion corresponding to D-branes. It follows,that the vacuum string field theory in general has to be regularized. For theregularization recently considered by Gaiotto et al., we show that theidentities we derive, are so constraining, that among all surface states theyuniquely select the simplest butterfly projector discovered numerically bythose authors. The reparametrization symmetries are also used to give a simpleproof that the butterfly states and their generalizations are indeedprojectors.
