Brane cosmology driven by the tachyon rolling down to its ground state isinvestigated. We adopt an effective field theoretical description for thetachyon and Randall-Sundrum type brane world scenario. After formulating basicequations, we show that the standard cosmology with a usual scalar field canmimic the low energy behavior of the system near the tachyon ground state. Wealso investigate qualitative behavior of the system beyond the low energyregime for positive, negative and vanishing 4-dimensional effectivecosmological constant $\Lambda_4=\kappa_5^4V(T_0)^2/12-|\Lambda_5|/2$, where$\kappa_5$ and $\Lambda_5$ are 5-dimensional gravitational coupling constantand (negative) cosmological constant, respectively, and $V(T_0)$ is the(positive) tension of the brane in the tachyon ground state. In particular, for$\Lambda_4<0$ the tachyon never settles down to its potential minimum and theuniverse eventually hits a big-crunch singularity.
