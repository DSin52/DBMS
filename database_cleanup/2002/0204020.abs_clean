A computation of the Casimir effect for a real scalar field in fourcommutative and noncommutative two-spheres is given in this paper. The main aimof this paper is to discuss the Casimir energy on the noncommutative spherewithin the theory with commutative time. The comparison with the noncommutativecylinder is also done.
