Title: Miracles and complementarity in de Sitter space

In this paper we consider a scenario, consisting of a de Sitter phasefollowed by a phase described by a scale factor $a(t)\sim t^{q}$, where$1/3<q<1$, which can be viewed as an inflationary toy model. It is argued thatthis scenario naively could lead to an information paradox. We propose that thephenomenon of Poincar\'{e} recurrences plays a crucial role in the resolutionof the paradox. We also comment on the relevance of these results to inflationand the CMBR.
