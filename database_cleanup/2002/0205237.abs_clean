Chern-Simons type gauge field is generated by the means of the singular areapreserving transformations in the lowest Landau level of electrons formingfractional quantum Hall state. Dynamics is governed by the system ofconstraints which correspond to the Gauss law in the non-commutativeChern-Simons gauge theory and to the lowest Landau level condition in thepicture of composite fermions. Physically reasonable solution to thisconstraints corresponds to the Laughlin state. It is argued that the modelleads to the non-commutative Chern-Simons theory of the QHE and compositefermions.
