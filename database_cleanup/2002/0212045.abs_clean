It is argued from geometrical, group-theoretical and physical points of viewthat in the framework of QCD it is not only necessary but also possible tomodify the Dirac equation so that correspondence principle holds valid. TheDirac wave equation for a quark is proposed and some consequences areconsidered. In particular, it is shown that interquark potential expresses theCoulomb law for the quarks and, in fact, coincides with the known Cornellpotential.
