Supergravity solutions describing wrapped membranes are easily constructedusing the technology of generalised calibrations, whereby the generalisedcalibration for a particular membrane is gauge equivalent to the supergravitythree-form under which the membrane is electrically charged. The generalisedcalibrations which can exist in spacetimes with non-vanishing flux have not yetbeen completely classified and we have so far been restricted to buildingsupergravity solutions around Kahler calibrations. In this paper, we take afirst step towards such a classification by studying membranes wrappingholomorphic curves in a complex subspace of spacetime. Supersymmetrypreservation imposes a constraint on the Hermitean metric which can beexpressed as a restriction on generalised calibrations. Allowed calibrationssatisfy this constraint equation and Kahler calibrations are found to be just asubclass of possible solutions.
