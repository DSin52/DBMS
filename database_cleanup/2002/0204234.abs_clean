In this paper we study the superstring version of the exactly solvable stringmodel constructed by Russo and Tseytlin. This model represents superstringtheory in a curved spacetime and can be seen as a generalization of the Melvinbackground. We investigate D-branes in this model as probes of the backgroundgeometry by constructing the boundary states. We find that spacetimesingularities in the model become smooth at high energy from the viewpoint ofopen string. We show that there always exist bulk (movable) D-branes by theeffect of electric flux. The model also includes Nappi-Witten model as thePenrose limit and supersymmetry is enhanced in the limit. We examine thisphenomenon in the open string spectrum. We also find the similar enhancement ofsupersymmetry can be occurred in several coset models.
