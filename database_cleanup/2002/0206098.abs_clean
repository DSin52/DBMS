We introduce a computational technique for studying non-supersymmetricdeformations of domain wall solutions of interest in AdS/CFT. We focus on theKlebanov-Strassler solution, which is dual to a confining gauge theory. From ananalysis of asymptotics we find that there are three deformations that leavethe ten-dimensional supergravity solution regular and preserve the globalbosonic symmetries of the supersymmetric solution. Also, we show that there areno regular near-extremal deformations preserving the global symmetries, as onemight expect from the existence of a gap in the gauge theory.
