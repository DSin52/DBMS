The gauge-invariant Chern-Simons-type Lorentz- and CPT-breaking term is herereassessed and a spin-projector method is adopted to account for the breaking(vector) parameter. Issues like causality, unitarity, spontaneousgauge-symmetry breaking and vortex formation are investigated, and consistencyconditions on the external vector are identified.
