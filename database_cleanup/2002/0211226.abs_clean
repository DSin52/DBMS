Title: Zero Energy States of Reduced Super Yang-Mills Theories in $d+1 = 4,6$

and 10 dimensions are necessarily $Spin(d)$ invariantAuthors: David Hasler, Jens Hoppe

We consider reduced Super Yang-Mills Theory in $d+1$ dimensions, where$d=2,3,5,9$. We present commutators to prove that for $d=3,5$ and 9 a possibleground state must be a $Spin(d)$ singlet. We also discuss the case $d=2$, wherewe give an upper bound on the total angular momentum and show that for odddimensional gauge group no $Spin(d)$ invariant state exists in the Hilbertspace.
