Relativistic resonances and decaying states are described by representationsof Poincar\'e transformations, similar to Wigner's definition of stableparticles. To associate decaying state vectors to resonance poles of the$S$-matrix, the conventional Hilbert space assumption (or asymptoticcompleteness) is replaced by a new hypothesis that associates different denseHardy subspaces to the in- and out-scattering states. Then one can separate thescattering amplitude into a background amplitude and one or several``relativistic Breit-Wigner'' amplitudes, which represent the resonances perse. These Breit-Wigner amplitudes have a precisely defined lineshape and areassociated to exponentially decaying Gamow vectors which furnish theirreducible representation spaces of causal Poincar\'e transformations into theforward light cone.
