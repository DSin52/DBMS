We study four-point correlation functions with logarithmic behaviour inLiouville field theory on a sphere, which consist of one kind of the localoperators. We study them as non-integrated correlation functions of thegravitational sector of two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to an ordinaryconformal field theory in the conformal gauge. We also examine, in the (p,q)minimal conformal field theories, a condition of the appearance of logarithmiccorrelation functions of gravitationally dressed operators.
