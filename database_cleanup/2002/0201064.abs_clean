We apply a self-consistent relativistic mean-field variational ``Gaussianfunctional'' (or Hartree) approximation to the linear $\sigma$ model withspontaneously and explicitly broken chiral O(4) symmetry. We set up theself-consistency, or ``gap'' and the Bethe-Salpeter equations. We check andconfirm the chiral Ward-Takahashi identities, among them the Nambu-Goldstonetheorem and the (partial) axial current conservation [CAC], both in and awayfrom the chiral limit. With explicit chiral symmetry breaking we confirm theDashen relation for the pion mass and partial CAC. We solve numerically the gapand Bethe-Salpeter equations, discuss the solutions' properties and theparticle content of the theory.
