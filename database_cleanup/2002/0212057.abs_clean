Witten has presented an argument for the vanishing of the cosmologicalconstant in 2+1 dimensions. This argument is crucially tied to the specificproperties of (2+1)-dimensional gravity. We argue that this reasoning can bedeconstructed to 3+1 dimensions under certain conditions. Our observation isalso tied to a possibility that there exists a well-defined UV completion of(3+1)-dimensional gravity.
