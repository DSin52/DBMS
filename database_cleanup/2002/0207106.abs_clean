We point out two extensions of the relation between matrix models,topological strings and N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. First, we note thatby considering double scaling limits of unitary matrix models one can obtainlarge N duals of the local Calabi-Yau geometries that engineer N=2 gaugetheories. In particular, a double scaling limit of the Gross-Wittenone-plaquette lattice model gives the SU(2) Seiberg-Witten solution, includingits induced gravitational corrections. Secondly, we point out that theeffective superpotential terms for N=1 ADE quiver gauge theories is similarlycomputed by large multi-matrix models, that have been considered in the contextof ADE minimal models on random surfaces. The associated spectral curves aremultiple branched covers obtained as Virasoro and W-constraints of thepartition function.
