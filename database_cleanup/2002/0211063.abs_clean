We study renormalization group flows in unitary two dimensional sigma modelswith asymptotically flat target spaces. Applying an infrared cutoff to thetarget space, we use the Zamolodchikov c-theorem to demonstrate that the targetspace ADM energy of the UV fixed point is greater than that of the IR fixedmirrors the well understood decrease of spacetime Bondi energy in the timeevolution process of tachyon condensation.
