We investigate the phenomenon of brane induced supersymmetry breakdown onorbifolds in the presence of a Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. General consistencyconditions are derived for arbitrary dimensions and the results are illustratedin the specific example of a 5-dimensional theory compactified on $S^1/Z_2$.This includes a discussion of the Kaluza-Klein spectrum and the possibility ofa brane induced supersymmetry restoration.
