Title: A Lie-Algebra model for a noncommutative space time geometry

Authors: Bernd-Dietrich Doerfel

Comments: references added in sect. 1,2

We propose a Lie-algebra model for noncommutative coordinate and momentumspace . Based on a rigid commutation relation for the commutators of space timeoperators the model is quite constrained if one tries to keep Lorentzinvariance as much as possible. We discuss the question of invariants esp. thedefinition of a mass.
