We analyze a potential that produces background charges which areautomatically quantized. This introduces a new mechanism for chargequantization, although so far it has only been implemented for backgroundcharges. We show that this same mechanism can also lead to an alternative meansof hiding extra dimensions that is analogous to the Kaluza-Klein approach.
