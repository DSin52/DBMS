The correspondence between del Pezzo surfaces and field theory models overthe complex numbers or for split real forms is extended to other real forms, inparticular to those compatible with supersymmetry. Specifically, all theoriesof the Magic triangle that reduce to the pure supergravities in four dimensionscorrespond to singular real del Pezzo surfaces and the same is true for theMagic square of ${\cal N}=2$ SUGRAS.A real del Pezzo surface is the invariant set under an antilinear involutionof a complex one. This conjugation induces an involution of the Picard groupthat preserves the anticanonical class and the intersection form. The knownnon-split U-duality algebras are embedded into superBorcherds algebras definedby their Cartan matrix (minus the intersection form) and fixed by theanti-involution. These data may be described by Tits-Satake bicoloureddiagrams.As in the split case, oxidation results from blowing down disjoint real $\RR{\mathbb P}_1$'s of self-intersection -1. The singular del Pezzo surfaces ofinterest are obtained by degenerating regular surfaces upon contraction of realcurves of self-intersection -2. We use the finite classification of real simplesingularities to exhibit the relevant normal surfaces. We also give a generalconstruction of more magic triangles like a type I split magic triangle andprove their (approximate) symmetry with respect to their diagonal, thissymmetry argument was announced in our previous paper for the split case.
