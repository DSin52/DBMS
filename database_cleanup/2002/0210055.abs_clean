"Theoretical and Experimental problems of General Relativity andGravitation"(Tomsk,Russia,July 1-7,2002)The relationship between the entropy of de Sitter (dS) Schwarzschild spaceand that of the CFT which lives on the brane by usingFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) equations and Cardy-Verlinde formula isdiscussed. We show that when the time-like brane crosses the black hole horizonof dS Schwarzschild black hole, the entropy of the CFT exactly agrees with theblack hole entropy of 5-dimensional dS background.
