The supersymmetric abelian Higgs model with N scalar fields admits multipledomain wall solutions. We perform a Callias-type index calculation to determinethe number of zero modes of this soliton. We confirm that the most generaldomain wall has 2(N-1) zero modes, which can be interpreted as the positionsand phases of (N-1) constituent domain walls. This implies the existence ofmoduli for a D-string interpolating between N D5-branes in IIB string theory.
