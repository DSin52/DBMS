Title: A Large-D Weyl Invariant String Model in Anti-de Sitter Space

Authors: Ian Davies and Paul Mansfield

Comments: LaTeX, 5pp, no figures

Strings propagating in AdS_{D+1} are made Weyl invariant to leading order inlarge D by a ghost-matter coupling that preserves the Poincare symmetry of theboundary.
