We construct the supergravity solution for fully localized D2/D6intersection. The near horizon limit of this solution is the supergravity dualof supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions with flavor. We use thissolution to formulate mirror symmetry of 2+1 dimensional gauge theories in thelanguage of AdS/CFT correspondence. We also construct the supergravity dual ofa non-commutative gauge theory with fundamental matter.
