We obtain the correct cohomology at any ghost number for the open and closedcovariant superstring, quantized by an approach which we recently developed. Wedefine physical states by the usual condition of BRST invariance and a newcondition involving a new current which is related to a grading of theunderlying affine Lie algebra.
