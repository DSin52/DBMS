Using the U(4) hybrid formalism, manifestly N=(2,2) worldsheet supersymmetricsigma models are constructed for the Type IIB superstring in Ramond-Ramondbackgrounds. The Kahler potential in these N=2 sigma models depends on fourchiral and antichiral bosonic superfields and two chiral and antichiralfermionic superfields. When the Kahler potential is quadratic, the model is afree conformal field theory which describes a flat ten-dimensional target spacewith Ramond-Ramond flux and non-constant dilaton. For more general Kahlerpotentials, the model describes curved target spaces with Ramond-Ramond fluxthat are not plane-wave backgrounds. Ricci-flatness of the Kahler metricimplies the on-shell conditions for the background up to the usual four-loopconformal anomaly.
