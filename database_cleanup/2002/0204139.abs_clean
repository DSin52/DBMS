Taking as starting point a perturbative study of the classical equations ofmotion of the non-Abelian Chern-Simons Theory with non-dynamical sources, wesearch for analytical expressions for link invarians. In order to present theseexpressions in a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant form, we introduce a setof differential forms associated with submanifolds in Euclidean three-spacethat allow us to write the link invariants as a kind of surface-dependentdiffeomorphism-invariants that present certain Abelian gauge symmetry.
