Comments: 10 pages, Latex, no figure, major changes are added

We study $SL(2;R)$ duality of the noncommutative DBI Lagrangian and thesymmetric conditions of this theory under the above group. By introducing someconsistent relations we see that the noncommutative (ordinary) DBI Lagrangianand its $SL(2;R)$ dual theory are dual of each other. Therefore, we find some$SL(2;R)$ invariant equations. In this case the noncommutativity parameter, its$T$-dual and its $SL(2;R)$ dual versions are expressed in terms of each other.Furthermore, we show that on the effective variables, $T$-duality and $SL(2;R)$duality do not commute.
