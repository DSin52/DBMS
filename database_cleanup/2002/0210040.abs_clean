Title: Bilocal Dynamics in Quantum Field Theory

Authors: Ciprian Acatrinei

Comments: 6 pages; to appear in the Proceedings of the first Romanian

Conference on Theoretical Physics, September 13-16, Bucharest, RomaniaAn essential aspect of noncommutative field theories is their bilocal nature.This feature, and its role in the IR/UV mixing, are discussed using a canonicalquantization procedure developed recently.
