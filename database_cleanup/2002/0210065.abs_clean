The anti-de Sitter C-metric (AdS C-metric) is characterized by a quiteinteresting new feature when compared with the C-metric in flat or de Sitterbackgrounds. Indeed, contrarily to what happens in these two last exactsolutions, the AdS C-metric only describes a pair of accelerated black holes ifthe acceleration parameter satisfies A>1/L, where L is the cosmological length.The two black holes cannot interact gravitationally and their acceleration istotally provided by the pressure exerted by a strut that pushes the black holesapart. Our analysis is based on the study of the causal structure, on thedescription of the solution in the AdS 4-hyperboloid in a 5D Minkowskiembedding spacetime, and on the physics of the strut. We also analyze the casesA=1/L and A<1/L that represent a single accelerated black hole in the AdSbackground.
