Using algebraic Bethe ansatz and the solution of the quantum inversescattering problem, we compute compact representations of the spin-spincorrelation functions of the XXZ-1/2 Heisenberg chain in a magnetic field. Atlattice distance m, they are typically given as the sum of m terms. Each term nof this sum, n = 1,...,m is represented in the thermodynamic limit as amultiple integral of order 2n+1; the integrand depends on the distance as thepower m of some simple function. The root of these results is the derivation ofa compact formula for the multiple action on a general quantum state of thechain of transfer matrix operators for arbitrary values of their spectralparameters.
