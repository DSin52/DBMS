2We obtain analytic, nonperturbative, approximate solutions of Yukawa theoryin the one-fermion sector using light-front quantization. The theory isregulated in the ultraviolet by the introduction of heavy Pauli-Villars scalarand fermion fields, each with negative norm. In order to obtain a directlysoluble problem, fermion-pair creation and annihilation are neglected, and thenumber of bosonic constituents is limited to one of either type. We discusssome of the features of the wave function of the eigensolution, including itsendpoint behavior and spin and orbital angular momentum content. The limit ofinfinite Pauli-Villars mass receives special scrutiny.
