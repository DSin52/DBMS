Title: Instantons and SL(2,R) Symmetry in Type IIB Supergravity

Authors: Martin B. Einhorn

Comments: 4 pages, no figures

We discuss the relation between the dual formulations of Type IIBsupergravity emphasizing the differences between Lorentz and Euclideansignature. We demonstrate how the SL(2,R) symmetry of the usual action ismanifested in the solution of the equations of motion with Euclidean signaturefor the dual theory.
