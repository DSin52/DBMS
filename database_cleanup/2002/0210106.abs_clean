Title: Calculation of Expectation Values of S$_{z}$ and S$^{2}$ operators for

spin-1 and spin-3/2 particlesAuthors: S. Gonen, A. Havare

Comments: 13 pages, no figures, submitted to Rev. Math. Phys

In the present article we calculate the expectation values of of S$_{z}$ andS$^{2}$ operators for spin-1 and spin-3/2 particles by expanding a general wavefunction which includes all spin values. The results are same as in thestantard quantum mechanics.
