We discuss the Penrose limit of pure AdS space, which is flat Minkowskispace. Even though there is no holographic principle, we construct a``holographic screen'' on which information on the corresponding CFT isencoded. The screen is obtained as a gauge-fixing condition upon restrictingthe Hilbert space to the states that are annihilated by the generator of scaletransformations. This constraint leads to Dirac brackets which turn thePoincare algebra into the algebra of the conformal group on the ``holographicscreen.''
