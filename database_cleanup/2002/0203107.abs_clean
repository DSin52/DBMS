I discuss cosmological models either derived from, or inspired by, stringtheory or M-theory. In particular I discuss solutions in the low-energyeffective theory and the role of the dilaton, moduli and antisymmetric formfields in the dimensionally reduced effective action. The pre big bang model isan attempt to use cosmological solutions to make observational predictions. Ithen discuss the effective theory of gravity found in recent brane-world modelswhere we live on a 3-brane embedded in a five-dimensional spacetime and how thestudy of cosmological perturbations may enable us to test these ideas.
