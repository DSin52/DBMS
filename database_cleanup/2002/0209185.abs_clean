An extension of the Keski-Vakuri, Kraus and Wilczek (KKW) analysis to blackhole spacetimes which are not Schwarzschild-type is presented. Preserving theregularity at the horizon and stationarity of the metric in order to deal withthe across-horizon physics, a more general coordinate transformation isintroduced. In this analysis the Hawking radiation is viewed as a tunnellingprocess which emanates from the non-Schwarzschild-type black hole. Expressionsfor the temperature and entropy of these non-Schwarzschild-type black holes areextracted. As a paradigm, in the context of this generalization, we considerthe Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) black hole as a dynamical backgroundand we derive the modified temperature and entropy of GHS black hole.Deviations are eliminated and corresponding standard results are recovered tothe lowest order in the emitted shell of energy. The extremal GHS black hole isfound to be non-``frozen'' since it is characterized by a constant non-zerotemperature. Furthermore, the modified extremality condition forbids nakedsingularities to form from the collapse of the GHS black hole.
