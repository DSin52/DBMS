of Mass, Velocity, and the Upper limit on EnergyAuthors: Alex Granik

We consider an alternative approach to doubly special-relativistic theories.The point of departure is not kappa-deformed algebra (or even group-theoreticalconsiderations) but rather 3 physical postulates defining particle's velocity,mass, and the upper bound on its energy in terms of the respective classicalquantities. For a specific definition of particle's velocity we obtainMaguejo-Smolin (MS) version of the double special-relativistic theory. It isshown that this version follows from the kappa-Poincare algebra by theappropriate choice of on the shell mass, such that it is always less or equalPlanck's mass. The kappa-deformed Hamiltonian is found which invalidates therecent arguments about unphysical predictions of the MS transformation.
