We study black hole evaporation of near-extremal black holes in sphericallyreduced models with asymptotically Minkowskian spacetime, with the effects ofthe back-reaction on the geometry included semi-classically. The stress-energytensor is calculated for null in-falling observers. It is shown that theevaporation proceeds smoothly and there are no instabilities of the outer orinner apparent horizon before the endpoint of evaporation.
