We propose a description of dark energy and acceleration of the universe inextended supergravities with de Sitter (dS) solutions. Some of them are relatedto M-theory with non-compact internal spaces. Masses of ultra-light scalars insolution corresponds to a minimum of the effective potential, the universeeventually becomes dS space. If dS solution corresponds to a maximum or asaddle point, which is the case in all known models based on N=8 supergravity,the flat universe eventually stops accelerating and collapses to a singularity.We show that in these models, as well as in the simplest models of dark energybased on N=1 supergravity, the typical time remaining before the globalcollapse is comparable to the present age of the universe, t = O(10^{10})years. We discuss the possibility of distinguishing between various models andfinding our destiny using cosmological observations.
