Title: On the Chern-Simons Gauge Theory of Anyons in the Fractional Quantum

Hall EffectAuthors: Hitoshi Ito

Comments: This is a supplementary comment on hep-th/0110197

This short note was born out of discussions on anyons in the FQHE at the YITPworkshop "Fundamental problems of quantum field theories" (December 19-21,2001, YITP, Kyoto). At that time, I felt that there might not be a soundconsensus of opinion on the subject. Now, I would like to show my understandinghere, the essential part of which is based on hep-th/0110197.The first problem discussed is a notion of ``bosonized electrons(bosonization)", which are unphysical objects from the standpoint of theChern-Simons gauge invariance. Therefore, their condensate is merely ofmathematical concept and the true physical state realized is a liquid-like onemade of degeneration of anyons. Based on this recognition, I argue about amechanism of the degeneration that results from the genuine CS gauge fieldtheory. It is noted that the Ginzburg-Landau effective theory is not necessary.As the last problem, the gauge invariance in the "composite-fermion theories"is discussed.
