We propose a scalar background in Minkowski spacetime imparting constantproper acceleration to a classical particle. In contrast to the case of aconstant electric field the proposed scalar potential does not createparticle-antiparticle pairs. Therefore an elementary particle accelerated bysuch field is a more appropriate candidate for an "Unruh-detector" than aparticle moving in a constant electric field. We show that the proposeddetector does not reveal the universal thermal response of the Unruh type.
