consistent only for particles with the half-integer spin (in usual units)In our previous papers it has been shown that quantum theory based on aGalois field (GFQT) possesses a new symmetry between particles andantiparticles, and for massless particles this symmetry (called the AB one) iscompatible with all representation operators of the symmetry algebra. In thepresent paper, it is shown that the AB symmetry is compatible with allrepresentation operators of the symmetry algebra in the general case. As aconsequence of simple arithmetical considerations, this symmetry is compatiblewith the vacuum condition, only for particles with half-integer spin (in usualunits). If the AB symmetry is combined with the spin-statistics theorem, onei) any neutral particle can be only composite but not elementary (this propertyhas been proved for the massless case in hep-th/0207192); ii) any interactioncan involve only an even number of creation/annihilation operators.
