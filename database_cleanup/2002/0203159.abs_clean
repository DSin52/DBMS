Title: Bound states in bottomless potentials

Authors: Tanmay Vachaspati

Comments: 2 pages

We consider classical and quantum dynamics on potentials that areasymptotically unbounded from below. By explicit construction we find thatquantum bound states can exist in certain bottomless potentials. The classicaldynamics in these potentials is novel. Only a set of zero measure of classicaltrajectories can escape to infinity. All other trajectories get trapped as theyget further out into the asymptotic region.
