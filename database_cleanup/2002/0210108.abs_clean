Title: A simple mechanical analog of the field theory of tachyon matter

Authors: Sayan Kar

Comments: 2 pages (RevTex4, twocolumn format), references added

In this brief note we show that the zero dimensional version of the fieldtheory of tachyon matter proposed by Sen, provides an action integralformulation for the motion of a particle in the presence of Newtonian gravityand nonlinear damping (quadratic in velocity).
