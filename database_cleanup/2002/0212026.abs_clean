Non-Abelian Supergauge TheoryAuthors: Dan Radu Grigore, G\"unter Scharf

Comments: 41 pages, LATEX2E

We consider the supersymmetric vector multiplet in a purely quantumframework. We obtain some discrepancies with respect to the literature in theexpression of the super-propagator and we prove that the model is consistentonly for positive mass. The gauge structure is constructed purely deductive andleads to the necessity of introducing scalar ghost superfields, in analogy tothe usual gauge theories. The construction of a consistent supersymmetric gaugetheory based on the vector model depends crucially one the definition of gaugeinvariance. We find some significant difficulties to impose a supersymmetricgauge invariance condition for the usual expressions from the literature.
