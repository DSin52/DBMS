We examine orbifolds of the IIB string via gauged supergravity. For thegravity duals of the A_{n-1} quiver gauge theories, we extract the masslessdegrees of freedom and assemble them into multiplets of N=4 gauged supergravityin five dimensions. We examine the embedding of the gauge group into theisometry group of the scalar manifold, as well as the symmetries of the scalarpotential. From this we find that there is a large SU(1,n) symmetry group whichrelates different RG flows in the dual quiver gauge theory. We find that thissymmetry implies an extension of the usual duality between ten-dimensional IIBsolutions which involves exchanging geometric moduli with background fluxes.
