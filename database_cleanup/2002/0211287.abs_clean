added, many typos correctedCachazo and Vafa provided a proof of the equivalence of $\mathcal{N}=1$dynamics obtained by deforming $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM by addition of certainsuperpotential terms, with that of type IIB superstring on Calabi-Yau manifoldwith fluxes. We extend the proof to SYM with massive flavors in fundamentalrepresentation of gauge group. For the gauge group we consider U(N) and$SO(N)/Sp(N)$ groups. When the adding tree level superpotential is square ofadjoint chiral superfield we can derive Affleck-Dine-Seiberg potentials. Byturning off the flux, we obtain Seiberg-Witten curves of $\mathcal{N}=2$theories.
