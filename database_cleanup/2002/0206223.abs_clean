We consider a five-dimensional constant curvature black hole, which isconstructed by identifying some points along a Killing vector in afive-dimensional AdS space. The black hole has the topology M_4 times S^1, itsexterior is time-dependent and its boundary metric is of the form of athree-dimensional de Sitter space times a circle, which means that the dualconformal field theory resides on a dynamical spacetime. We calculate thequasilocal stress-energy tensor of the gravitational background and then thestress-energy tenor of the dual conformal field theory. It is found that thetrace of the tensor does indeed vanish, as expected. Further we find that theconstant curvature black hole spacetime is just the "bubble of nothing"resulting from Schwarzschild-AdS black holes when the mass parameter of thelatter vanishes.
