Workshop on the Fundamental Problems of High Energy Physics and Field Theory,27-29 June, Protvino, RussiaA new concept of geometrization of electromagnetic field is proposed. Insteadof the concept of extended field and its point sources, the interactingMaxwellian and Dirac electron--positron fields are considered as a microscopicunified closed connected nonmetrized space--time 4-manifold. Within thisapproach, the Dirac equation proves to be a group-theoretic relation thataccounts for the topological and metric properties of this manifold. The Diracspinors serve as basis functions of its fundamental group representation, whilethe tensor components of electromagnetic field prove to be the components of acurvature tensor of the relevant covering space. A basic distinction of thesuggested approach from the geometrization of gravitational field in generalrelativity is that, first, not only the field is geometrized but also are itsmicroscopic sources and, second, the field and its sources are treated not as ametrized Riemannian space--time but as a nonmetrized space-- time manifold. Apossibility to geometrize weak interaction is also discussed.
