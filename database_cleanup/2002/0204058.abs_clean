We study cosmological solutions of Einstein gravity with a positivecosmological constant in diverse dimensions. These include big-bang models thatre-collapse, big-bang models that approach de Sitter acceleration at latetimes, and bounce models that are both past and future asymptotically deSitter. The re-collapsing and the bounce geometries are all tall in the sensethat entire spatial slices become visible to a comoving observer before the endof conformal time, while the accelerating big-bang geometries can be eithershort or tall. We consider the interpretation of these cosmological solutionsas renormalization group flows in a dual field theory and give a geometricinterpretation of the associated c-function as the area of the apparentcosmological horizon in Planck units. The covariant entropy bound requiresquantum effects to modify the early causal structure of some of our big-bangsolutions.
