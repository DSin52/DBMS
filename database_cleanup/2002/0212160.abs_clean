We calculate one-loop scattering amplitudes for gravitons and two-forms indimensions greater than four. The string based Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relationshipsallow gravitons and two-forms to be treated in a unified manner. We use theresults to determine the ultra-violet infinities present in these amplitudesand show how these determine the renormalised one-loop action in six and eightdimensions.
