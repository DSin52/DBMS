Title: M-theory on manifolds of $G_{2}$ holonomy

Authors: M. J. Duff

Comments: After the completion of this work, a G\"{o}del universe with 14

supersymmetries was discovered, consistent with generalized holonomy.References addedPhysics; Differential GeometryIn 1981, covariantly constant spinors were introduced into Kaluza-Kleintheory as a way of counting the number of supersymmetries survivingcompactification. These are related to the {\it holonomy} group of thecompactifying manifold. The first non-trivial example was provided in 1982 byD=11 supergravity on the squashed $S^{7}$, whose $G_{2}$ holonomy yields N=1 inD=4. In 1983, another example was provided by D=11 supergravity on $K3$, whoseSU(2) holonomy yields half the maximum supersymmetry. In 2002, $G_{2}$ and $K3$manifolds continue to feature prominently in the full D=11 M-theory and itsdualities. In particular, singular $G_{2}$ compactifications can yield chiral$(N=1,D=4)$ models with realistic gauge groups. The notion of generalizedholonomy is also discussed.
