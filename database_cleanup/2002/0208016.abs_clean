We study the thermodynamical observables of the 2d Ising model in theneighborhood of the magnetic axis by means of numerical diagonalization of thetransfer matrix. In particular, we estimate the leading order corrections tothe Zamolodchikov mass spectrum and find evidence of non-vanishingcontributions due to the stress-energy tensor.
