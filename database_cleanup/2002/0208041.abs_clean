We consider a BMN operator with one scalar, phi, and one vector, D_{m}Z,impurity field and compute the anomalous dimension both at planar and toruslevels. This "mixed" operator corresponds to a string state with two creationoperators which belong to different SO(4) sectors of the background. Theanomalous dimension at both levels is found to be the same as the scalarimpurity BMN operator. At planar level this constitutes a consistency check ofBMN conjecture. Agreement at the torus level can be explained by an argumentusing supersymmetry and supression in the BMN limit. The same argument impliesthat a class of fermionic BMN operators also have the same planar and toruslevel anomalous dimensions. Implications of the results for the map from N=4SYM theory to string theory in the pp-wave background are discussed.
