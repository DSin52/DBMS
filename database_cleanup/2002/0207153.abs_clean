Conference "RG 2002", Strba, SlovakiaA manifestly gauge invariant exact renormalization group for pure SU(N)Yang-Mills theory is proposed, allowing gauge invariant calculations, withoutany gauge fixing or ghosts. The necessary gauge invariant regularisation whichimplements the effective cutoff, is naturally incorporated by embedding thetheory into a spontaneously broken SU(N|N) super-gauge theory. This guaranteesfiniteness to all orders in perturbation theory.
