We discuss the quantization of a scalar particle moving in two-dimensional deSitter space. We construct the conformal quantum mechanical model on theasymptotic boundary of de Sitter space in the infinite past. We obtain explicitexpressions for the generators of the conformal group and calculate theeigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. We also show that two-point correlators are inagreement with the Green function one obtains from the wave equation in thebulk de Sitter space.
