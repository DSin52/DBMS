We consider the Cauchy problem of the gravitational wave with the initialdata distributed only around the brane in the one brane model of Randall andSundrum, and examine its behavior as t\to\infty. Then we find its leadingbehavior is t^{-6} unlike an ordinary flat 5-dimensional space-time. Such asignal shows that the Huygens principle is violated on the 4-dimensional braneworld even asymptotically and also shows the difference between compact andnon-compact brane worlds. Some comments are also given related to AdS/CFTcorrespondence.
