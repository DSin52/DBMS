Title: Vacuum Energy, Cosmological Supersymmetry Breaking and Inflation from

Colliding Brane WorldsComments: six pages latex, uses special macros, talk presented at the First

International Conference on String Phenomenology, Oxford (UK), July 2002In the context of colliding brane worlds I discuss a toy cosmological model,developed in collaboration with E. Gravanis, which arguably produces inflationand a relaxing to zero cosmological ``constant'' hierarchically small ascompared to the supersymmetry breaking (TeV) scale. Supersymmetry breaking isinduced by compactification of the brane worlds on magnetized tori. The crucialingredient is the non-criticality (non conformality) of string theory on theobservable brane world induced at the collision, which is thus viewed as acause for departure from equilibrium in this system. The hierarchical smallnessof the present-era vacuum energy, as compared to the SUSY breaking scale, isthus attributed to relaxation.
