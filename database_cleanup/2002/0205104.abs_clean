The superconformal structure of coset superspaces with AdS_m x S^n geometryof bosonic subspaces is studied. It is shown, in particular, that theconventional superspace extensions of the coset manifolds AdS_2 x S^2, AdS_3 xS^3 and AdS_5 x S^5, which arise as solutions of corresponding D=4,6, 10supergravities and have been extensively studied in connection with AdS/CFTcorrespondence, are not superconformally flat, though their bosonicsubmanifolds are conformally flat. We give a group-theoretical reasoning forthis fact. We find that in the AdS_2 x S^2 and AdS_3 x S^3 cases there existdifferent supercosets based on the supergroup OSp(4^*|2) which aresuperconformally flat. We also argue that in D=2,3,4 and 5 there existsuperconformally flat `pure' AdS_D supercosets. Two methods of checking thesuperconformal flatness are proposed. One of them consists in solving theMaurer-Cartan structure equations and the other is based on embedding theisometry supergroup of the AdS_m x S^n superspace into a superconformal groupin (m+n)-dimensional Minkowski space. Finally, we discuss some applications ofthe above results to the description of supersymmetric dynamical systems.
