We analyse the spacetime structure of the global vortex and its maximalanalytic extension in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions. We find thatthe vortex compactifies space on the scale of the Hubble expansion of itsworldvolume, in a manner reminiscent of that of the domain wall. We calculatethe effective volume of this compactification and remark on its relevance tohierarchy resolution with extra dimensions. We also consider stronglygravitating vortices and derive bounds on the existence of a global vortexsolution.
