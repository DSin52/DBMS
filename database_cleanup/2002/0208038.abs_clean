We derive boundary conditions for the covariant open string corresponding toD-branes in an Hpp-wave, by requiring kappa symmetry of its bulk action. Bothhalf-supersymmetric and quarter-supersymmetric branes are seen to arise in thisway, and the analysis furthermore agrees fully with the existing probe braneand supergravity computations. We elaborate on the origin of dynamical andkinematical supersymmetries from the covariant point of view. In particular wefocus on the D-string which only preserves half of the dynamicalsupersymmetries and none of the kinematical ones. We discuss its origin inAdS_5 x S^5 and its world-volume spectrum.
