Differential Equations and their Applications to Geometry & Physics", 2remarks addedA 3-dimensional model dual to the Rozansky-Witten topological sigma-modelwith a hyper-Kaehler target space is considered. It is demonstrated that aFeynman diagram calculation of the classical part of its partition functionyields the Milnor linking number.
