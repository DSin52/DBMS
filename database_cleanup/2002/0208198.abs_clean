Title: Duality and Lorentzian Kac-Moody Algebras

Authors: David Ian Olive

Comments: 8 pages, Invited talk at Workshop on Integrable Theories, Solitons

and Duality. To appear in JHEP proceedingsA review is given of ideas in electromagnetic duality and connections tointegrable field theories with soliton solutions. This leads on to a summary ofrecent work on Lorentzian algebras.
