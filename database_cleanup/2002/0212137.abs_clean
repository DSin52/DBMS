Ter-MartirosyanBrane-like vertex operators, defining backgrounds with the ghost-mattermixing in NSR superstring theory, play an important role in a world-sheetformulation of D-branes and M theory, being creation operators for extendedobjects in the second quantized formalism. In this paper we show that dilaton'sbeta function in ghost-matter mixing backgrounds becomes stochastic. Therenormalization group (RG) equations in ghost-matter mixing backgrounds lead tonon-Markovian Fokker-Planck equations which solutions describe superstrings incurved space-times with brane-like metrics.We show that Feigenbaum universalityconstant $\delta=4,669...$ describing transitions from order to chaos in a hugevariety of dynamical systems, appears analytically in these RG equations. Wefind that the appearance of this constant is related to the scaling of relativespace-time curvatures at fixed points of the RG flow. In this picture the fixedpoints correspond to the period doubling of Feigenbaum iterational schemes.
