We use Berkovits' pure spinor quantization to compute various three-pointtree correlation functions in position-space for the Type IIB superstring. Wesolve the constraint equations for the vertex operators and obtain explicitexpressions for the graviton and axion components of the vertex operators.Using these operators we compute tree level correlation functions in flat spaceand discuss their extension to the AdS5 X S5 background.
