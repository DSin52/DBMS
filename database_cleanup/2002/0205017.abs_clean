Title: The Quantum Mechanics SUSY Algebra

Authors: R. de Lima Rodrigues

Comments: PUBLICATION

no figures. A new version with new sections will be submitted for publicationStarting with the Lagrangian formalism with N=2 supersymmetry in terms of twoGrassmann variables in Classical Mechanics, the Dirac canonical quantizationmethod is implemented. The N=2 supersymmetry algebra is associated toone-component and two-component eigenfunctions considered in the Schr\"odingerpicture of Nonrelativistic Quantum Mechanics. Applications are contemplated.
