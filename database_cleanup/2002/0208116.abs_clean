Title: Topological charge of Center Vortices

Authors: H. Reinhardt

Comments: Proceedings, Lattice 2002, 3p, latex

The topological charge of center vortices is discussed in terms of theself-intersection number of the closed vortex surfaces in 4-dimensionalEuclidian space-time and in terms of the temporal changes of the writhingnumber of the time-dependent vortex loops in 3-dimensional space.
