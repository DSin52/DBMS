We investigate some of the intricate features in a gravity decoupling limitof a open bosonic string theory, in a constant electromagnetic (EM-) field. Weexplain the subtle nature of space-time at short distances, due to itsentanglement with the gauge field windings in the theory. Incorporating themass-shell condition in the theory, we show that the time coordinate is small,of the order of EM-string scale, and the space coordinates are large. Weperform a careful analysis in the critical regime to describe the decoupling ofa series of gauge-string windings in successions, just below the Hagedorntemperature. We argue for the condensation of gauge-string at the Hagedorntemperature, which is followed by the decoupling of tachyonic particles. Wedemonstrate the phenomena by revoking the effective noncommutative dynamics forthe D(3)-brane and obtain nonlinear corrections to U(1) gauge theory. Wediscuss the spontaneous breaking of noncommutative U(1) symmetry and show thatthe Hagedorn phase is described by the noninteracting gauge particles. Thenotion of time reappears in the phase at the expense of temperature. Itsuggests a complementarity between two distinct notions, time and temperature,at short distances.
