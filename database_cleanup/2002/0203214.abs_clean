Title: Charge Superselection Sectors for Scalar QED on the Lattice

Authors: J. Kijowski (Center for Theoretical Physics, Polish Academy of

Sciences, Warsaw, Poland) G. Rudolph (Institut fuer Theoretische Physik,Universit\"at Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany) C. \'Sliwa (Center for TheoreticalPhysics, Polish Academy of Sciences Warsaw, Poland)The lattice model of scalar quantum electrodynamics (Maxwell field coupled toa complex scalar field) in the Hamiltonian framework is discussed.It is shown that the algebra of observables ${\cal O}({\Lambda})$ of thismodel is a $C^*$-algebra, generated by a set of gauge-invariant elementssatisfying the Gauss law and some additional relations. Next, the faithful,irreducible and non-degenerate representations of ${\cal O}({\Lambda})$ arefound. They are labeled by the value of the total electric charge, leading to adecomposition of the physical Hilbert space into charge superselection sectors.In the Appendices we give a unified description of spinorial and scalar quantumelectrodynamics and, as a byproduct, we present an interesting example ofweakly commuting operators, which do not commute strongly.
