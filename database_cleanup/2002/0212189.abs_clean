The history of discovery of bosonic string theory is well documented. Thistheory evolved as an attempt to find a multidimensional analogue of Euler'sbeta function. Such an analogue had in fact been known in mathematicsliterature at least in 1922 and was studied subsequently by mathematicians suchas Selberg, Weil and Deligne among others. The mathematical interpretation ofthis multidimensional beta function is markedly different from that describedin physics literature. This paper aims to bridge the gap between the existingtreatments. Preserving all results of conformal field theories intact,developed formalism employing topological, algebro-geometric, number-theoreticand combinatorial metods is aimed to provide better understanding of theVeneziano amplitudes and, thus, of string theories.
