Section 2The equations for the solitons arbitrarily rotating in the ordinary andisotopic space are obtained. The wave functions of the corresponding dynamicstates in the quantum case are found. The generalized matrix of the moments ofinertia is degenerate for the O(2)-invariant configurations characteristic forthe nucleon and delta-isobar. The equation for such configurations isestablished. It is shown that the spin-isospin rotation prevents the collapseof the soliton states in the SU(2) sigma-model. The entire consideration isbased on the variational approach to the method of collective variables.
