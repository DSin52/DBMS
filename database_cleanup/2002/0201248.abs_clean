We study one-loop effective action of Berkooz-Douglas Matrix theory andobtain non-abelian action of D0-branes in the background field produced bylongitudinal 5-branes. Since these 5-branes do not have D0-brane charge and arenot present in BFSS Matrix theory, our analysis can be regarded as anindependent test for the coupling of D-branes to general weak backgroundsproposed by Taylor and Van Raamsdonk, and also as a check of consistencybetween the two versions of Matrix theory. The coupling to the 5-branes whichwe obtain is basically consistent with the previous proposal, but we point outsubtleties in the ordering of matrices for the multipole moments.
