We formulate a prescription for computing Minkowski-space correlators fromAdS/CFT correspondence. This prescription is shown to give the correct retardedpropagators at zero temperature in four dimensions, as well as at finitetemperature in the two-dimensional conformal field theory dual to the BTZ blackhole. Using the prescription, we calculate the Chern-Simons diffusion constantof the finite-temperature N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the strongcoupling limit. We explain why the quasinormal frequencies of theasymptotically AdS background correspond to the poles of the retarded Green'sfunction of the boundary conformal field theory.
