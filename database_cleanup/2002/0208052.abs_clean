The virtual black hole phenomenon, which has been observed previously inspecific models, is established for generic 2D dilaton gravity theories withscalar matter. The ensuing effective line element can become asymptoticallyflat only for two classes of models, among them spherically reduced theoriesand the string inspired dilaton black hole (CGHS model).We present simple expressions for the lowest order scalar field vertices ofthe effective theory which one obtains after integrating out geometry exactly.Treating the boundary in a natural and simple way asymptotic states, tree-levelvertices and tree-level S-matrix are conformally invariant.Examples are provided pinpointing the physical consequences of virtual blackholes on the (CPT-invariant) S-matrix for gravitational scattering of scalarparticles. For minimally coupled scalars the evaluation of the S-matrix inclosed form is straightforward.For a class of theories including the CGHS model all tree-graph verticesvanish, which explains the particular simplicity of that model and at the sametime shows yet another essential difference to the Schwarzschild case.
