Title: Supersymmetric Gauge Theories, Vortices and Equivariant Cohomology

Comments: 45 pages, Latex

We construct actions for (p,0)- and (p,1)- supersymmetric, 1 <= p <= 4,two-dimensional gauge theories coupled to non-linear sigma model matter with aWess-Zumino term. We derive the scalar potential for a large class of thesemodels. We then show that the Euclidean actions of the (2,0) and(4,0)-supersymmetric models without Wess-Zumino terms are bounded bytopological charges which involve the equivariant extensions of the Kahlerforms of the sigma model target spaces evaluated on the two-dimensionalspacetime. We give similar bounds for Euclidean actions of appropriate gaugetheories coupled to non-linear sigma model matter in higher spacetimedimensions which now involve the equivariant extensions of the Kahler forms ofthe sigma model target spaces and the second Chern character of gauge fields.The BPS configurations are generalisations of abelian and non-abelian vortices.
