Title: Butterfly Tachyons in Vacuum String Field Theory

Authors: Peter Matlock

Comments: 14 pages, 6 figures, revtex

We use geometrical conformal field theory methods to investigate tachyonfluctuations about the butterfly projector state in Vacuum String Field Theory.We find that the on-shell condition for the tachyon field is equivalent to therequirement that the quadratic term in the string-field action vanish on shell.This further motivates the interpretation of the butterfly state as a D-brane.We begin a calculation of the tension of the butterfly, and conjecture thatthis will match the case of the sliver and further strengthen thisinterpretation.
