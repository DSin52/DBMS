We investigate de Sitter/conformal field theory (dS/CFT) correspondence intwo dimensions. We define the conserved mass of de Sitter spacetime andformulate the correspondence along the lines of anti-de Sitter/conformal fieldtheory duality. Asymptotic symmetry group, mass, and central charge of deSitter spacetime are equal to those of anti-de Sitter spacetime. The entropy oftwo-dimensional de Sitter spacetime is evaluated by applying Cardy formula. Wecalculate the boundary correlators induced by the propagation of the dilaton intwo-dimensional de Sitter space. Although the dilaton is a tachyonicperturbation in the bulk, boundary conformal correlators have positivedimension.
