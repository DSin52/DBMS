modifiedIt is generally known that linear (free) field theories are one of the fewQFT that are exactly soluble. There are, however, (at least) two very differentlanguages to describe them, Fock space methods and the Schrodinger functionaldescription. In this paper, the precise sense in which the two representationsare related is explored. The well known fact that the usual Fock representationis described by a Gaussian measure in the functional picture is proved in anexplicit fashion, starting `from scratch', for a real scalar field theory onMinkowski spacetime but for arbitrary, non-inertial embeddings of the Cauchysurface.
