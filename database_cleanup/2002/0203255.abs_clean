The Killing spinor equations for pp-wave solutions of eleven dimensionalsupergravity are analysed and it is shown that there are solutions thatpreserve 18,20,22 and 24 supersymmetries, in addition to the generic solutionpreserving 16 supersymmetries and the Kowalski-Glikman solution preserving 32supersymmetries.
