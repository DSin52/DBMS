We study the coupling of the closed string to the open string in thetopological B-model. These couplings can be viewed as gauge invariantobservables in the open string field theory, or as deformations of thedifferential graded algebra describing the OSFT. This is interpreted as anintertwining map from the closed string sector to the deformation (Hochschild)complex of the open string algebra. By an explicit calculation we show thatthis map induces an isomorphism of Gerstenhaber algebras on the level ofcohomology. Reversely, this can be used to derive the closed string from theopen string. We shortly comment on generalizations to other models, such as theA-model.
