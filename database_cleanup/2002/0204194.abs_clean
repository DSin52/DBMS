Title: Topology of Center Vortices

Authors: H. Reinhardt

Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, Latex2e, Talk given at the NATO workshop on

``Confinement, Topology, and other Non-Perturbative Aspects of QCD'', StaraLesna, Slovakia, January 21-27, 2000In this talk I study the topology of mathematically idealised centervortices, defined in a gauge invariant way as closed (infinitely thin) fluxsurfaces (in D=4 dimensions) which contribute the $n^{th}$ power of anon-trivial center element to Wilson loops when they are n-foldly linked to thelatter. In ordinary 3-space generic center vortices represent closed magneticflux loops which evolve in time. I show that the topological charge of such atime-dependent vortex loop can be entirely expressed by the temporal changes ofits writhing number.
