The renormalization group (RG) flow for the two-dimensional sine-Gordon modelis determined by means of Polchinski's RG equation at next-to-leading order inthe derivative expansion. In this work we have two different goals, (i) toconsider the renormalization scheme-dependence of Polchinski's method bymatching Polchinski's equation with the Wegner-Houghton equation and with thereal space RG equations for the two-dimensional dilute Coulomb-gas, (ii) to gobeyond the local potential approximation in the gradient expansion in order toclarify the supposed role of the field-dependent wave-function renormalization.The well-known Coleman fixed point of the sine-Gordon model is recovered afterlinearization, whereas the flow exhibits strong dependence on the choice of therenormalization scheme when non-linear terms are kept. The RG flow is comparedto those obtained in the Wegner-Houghton approach and in the dilute gasapproximation for the two-dimensional Coulomb-gas.
