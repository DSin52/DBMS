We argue that the early universe may be described by an initial state ofspace-filling branes and anti-branes. At high temperature this system isstable. At low temperature tachyons appear and lead to a phase transition,dynamics, and the creation of D-branes. These branes are cosmologicallyproduced in a generic fashion by the Kibble mechanism. From an entropic pointof view, the formation of lower dimensional branes is preferred and $D3$brane-worlds are exponentially more likely to form than higher dimensionalbranes. Virtually any brane configuration can be created from such phasetransitions by adjusting the tachyon profile. A lower bound on the number
