The influence of hypersonic waves excited in a single crystal is investigatedon the process of electron-positron pair creation by high-energy photons. Thecoherent part of the corresponding differential cross-section is derived as afunction of the amplitude and wave number of the hypersound. The values of theparameters are specified for which the latter affects remarkably on the paircreation cross-section. It is shown that under certain conditions the presenceof hypersonic waves can result in enhancement of the process cross-section.
