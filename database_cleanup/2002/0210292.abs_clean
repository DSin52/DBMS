An overview is presented of some cosmological aspects of string theory.Recent developments are emphasised, especially the attempts to derive inflationor alternatives to inflation from the dynamics of branes in string theory. Timedependent backgrounds with potential cosmological implications, such as thoseprovided by negative tension branes and S-branes and the rolling string tachyonare also discussed.
