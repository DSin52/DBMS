Title: Exact Solutions in Open Bosonic String Field Theory and Marginal

Deformation in CFTAuthors: J. Kluson

Comments: 18 pages

In this paper we continue our study of the exact solution in open bosonicstring field theory. We present solution in the string field theory defined onthe background corresponding to the boundary conformal field theory ($BCFT$)describing D25-brane. We then show that the string field theory that arisesfrom the original one by an expansion about this classical solution can beinterpreted as the string field theory defined on the new $BCFT''$ that isrelated to the original $BCFT$ by marginal boundary interaction. In particularwe will show that this approach can be useful for the study of the exact timedependent solution in the open bosonic string field theory.
