Title: Predictions for PP-wave string amplitudes from perturbative SYM

Authors: Umut Gursoy

Comments: major changes in section 2, corrections and new results in section 5,

typo corrections and new referencesThe role of general two-impurity multi-trace operators in the BMNcorrespondence is explored. Surprisingly, the anomalous dimensions of alltwo-impurity multi-trace BMN operators to order g_2^2\lambda' are completelydetermined in terms of single-trace anomalous dimensions. This is due tosuppression of connected field theory diagrams in the BMN limit and this facthas important implications for some string theory processes on the PP-wavebackground. We also make gauge theory predictions for the matrix elements ofthe light-cone string field theory Hamiltonian in the two string-two string andone string-three string sectors.
