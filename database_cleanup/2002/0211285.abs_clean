In this paper we study the Penrose limit of AdS_5 orbifolds. The orbifold canbe either in the pure spatial directions or space and time directions. For theAdS_5/\Gamma\times S^5 spatial orbifold we observe that after the Penrose limitwe obtain the same result as the Penrose limit of AdS_5\times S^5/\Gamma. Weidentify the corresponding BMN operators in terms of operators of the gaugetheory on R\times S^3/\Gamma. The semi-classical description of rotatingstrings in these backgrounds have also been studied. For the spatial AdSorbifold we show that in the quadratic order the obtained action for thefluctuations is the same as that in S^5 orbifold, however, the higher loopcorrection can distinguish between two cases.
