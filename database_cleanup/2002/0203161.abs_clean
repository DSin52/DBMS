We present a large and universal class of new boundary states which breakpart of the chiral symmetry in the underlying bulk theory. Our formulas arebased on coset constructions and they can be regarded as a non-abeliangeneralization of the ideas that were used by Maldacena, Moore and Seiberg tobuild new boundary states for SU(N). We apply our expressions to constructdefect lines joining two conformal field theories with possibly differentcentral charge. Such defects can occur e.g. in the AdS/CFT correspondence whenbranes extend to the boundary of the AdS-space.
