Recent studies of homogeneous anisotropic universe models in the brane worldscenario show that the cosmological singularity in this context is isotropic.It has therefore been suggested that this may be a generic feature ofsingularities on the brane, even in the inhomogeneous case. Using aperturbative approach, we show that this is not the case. As in the GR case,the presence of decaying modes in the perturbations signal the instability (inthe past) of the isotropic singularity. The brane universe is therefore notisotropy and homogeneity remains to be explained.
