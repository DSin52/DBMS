Title: Comments on Coleman's article "There are no Goldstone Bosons in Two

Dimensions"Authors: M. Faber and A. N. Ivanov

Comments: 32 pages, Latex, no figures, the text is revised, some assertions are

changedWe analyse Coleman's theorem asserting the absence Goldstone bosons andspontaneously broken continuous symmetry in the quantum field theory of a freemassless (pseudo)scalar field in 1+1-dimensional space-time (Comm. Math. Phys.31, 259 (1973)). We confirm that Coleman's theorem reproduces well-knownWightman's statement about the non-existence of a quantum field theory of afree massless (pseudo)scalar field in 1+1-dimensional space-time in terms ofWightman's observables defined on the test functions from S(R^2). Referring toour results (Eur. Phys. J. C 24, 653 (2002)) we argue that a formulation of aquantum field theory of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field in terms ofWightman's observables defined on the test functions from S_0(R^2) iswell--motivated by the possibility to remove a collective zero-mode motion ofthe ``center of mass'' of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field (Eur. Phys. J. C24, 653 (2002)) responsible for infrared divergences of the Wightman functions.We show that in the quantum field theory of a free massless (pseudo)scalarfield with Wightman's observables defined on the test functions from S_0(R^2) acontinuous symmetry is spontaneously broken. Coleman's theorem reformulated forthe test functions from S_0(R^2) does not refute this result. We construct amost general version of a quantum field theory of a self-coupled massless(pseudo)scalar field with conserved current. We show that this theory satisfiesWightman's axioms and Wightman's positive definiteness condition withWightman's observables defined on the test functions from S(R^2) and possessesspontaneously broken continuous symmetry.
