We present a model of interacting quantum fields, formulated in anon-perturbative manner. One of the fields is treated semi-classically, theother is the photon field. The model has an interpretation of anelectromagnetic field in a fluctuating spacetime.The model is equivalent with the quantization of electromagnetism proposedrecently by Czachor. Interesting features are that standard photon theory isrecovered as a limiting case, and that localized field operators for theelectromagnetic field exist as unbounded operators in Hilbert space.
