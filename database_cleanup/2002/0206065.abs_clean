We use the supergravity modes to clarify the role of the prefactor in thelight-cone superstring field theory on PP-wave background. We verify some ofthe proposals of the recent paper hep-th/0205089 and give further evidence forthe correspondence between N=4 SYM gauge theory and string theory on PP-wave.We also consider energy-preserving processes and find that they give vanishingcubic interaction Hamiltonian matrix.
