Bogolubov's chain of equations method for temperature Wightman functions issuggested for investigation of relativistic phase transition. The chainequations for the Wightman functions forming momentum--energy tensor areobtained. It is clarified that structure of the chain equations determines thebasis approximation (the Hartree - Fock approximation) and correctionsrenormalized equations for effective masses, order parameter and generatingfunctional which reproduce those equations are obtained. Being considered onthe solution of the gap equations for the effective masses the generatingfunctional turns to nonequilibrium functional of free energy density, whichallows to obtain phases stability conditions. Thermodynamic observables likeheat capacity and sonic speed are calculated. The correction to theHartree-Fock approximations is ascertained to be small for all temperaturesexcluding vicinity of the phases equilibrium point.
