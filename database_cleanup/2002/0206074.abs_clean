The effective string action of the color-electric flux tube in the U(1) xU(1) dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL) theory is studied by performing a path-integralanalysis by taking into accountthe finite thickness of the flux tube. The DGLtheory, corresponding to the low-energy effective theory of Abelian-projectedSU(3) gluodynamics, can be expressed as s [U(1)]^{3} dual Abelian Higgs (DAH)model with a certain constraint in the Weyl symmetric formulation. Thisformulation allows us to adopt quite similar path-integral techniques as in theU(1) DAH model, and therefore, the resulting effective string action in theU(1) x U(1) DGL theory has also quite a similar structure except the number ofcolor degrees of freedom. A modified Yukawa interaction appears as a boundarycontribution, which is completely due to the finite thickness of the flux tube,and is reduced into the ordinary Yukawa interaction in the deep type-II(London) Limit.
