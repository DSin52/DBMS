In type IIB light-cone superstring field theory, the cubic interaction hasinteraction point. In this paper we extend our earlier work hep-th/0204146 bycomputing the matrix elements of this operator in the oscillator basis ofpp-wave string theory for all mu p^+ alpha'. By evaluating these matrixelements for large mu p^+ alpha', we check a recent conjecture relating matrixelements of the light-cone string field theory Hamiltonian (with prefactor) tocertain three-point functions of BMN operators in the gauge theory. We alsomake several explicit predictions for gauge theory.
