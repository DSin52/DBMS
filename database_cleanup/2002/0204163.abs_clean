For the noncommutative torus ${\cal T}$, in case of the N.C. parameter$\theta = \frac{Z}{n}$, we construct the basis of Hilbert space ${\ca$H}_n$ interms of $\theta$ functions of the positions $z_i$ of $n$ solitons. Thewrapping around the torus generates the algebra ${\cal A}_n$, which is the $Z_n\times Z_n$ Heisenberg group on $\theta$ functions. We find the generators $g$of an local elliptic $su(n)$, w$transform covariantly by the global gaugetransformation of ${\cal A}$By acting on ${\cal H}_n$ we establish theisomorphism of ${\cal A}_n$$g$. We embed this $g$ into the $L$-matrix of theelliptic Gaudin and$models to give the dynamics. The moment map of this twistedcotangent $su_n({\cal T})$ bundle is matched to the $D$-equation withFayet-Illiopoulos source term, so the dynamics of the N.C. solitons becomesthat of the brane. The geometric configuration $(k, u)$ of th$spectral curve${\rm det}|L(u) - k| = 0$ describes the brane configuration, with the dynamicalvariables $z_i$ of N.C. solitons as$moduli $T^{\otimes n} / S_n$. Furthermore,in the N.C. Chern-Simons theory for the quantum Hall effect, the constrainequation with quasiparticle source is identified also with the moment mapeqaution $the N.C. $su_n({\cal T})$ cotangent bundle with marked points. Theeigenfunction of the Gaudin differential $L$-operators as theLaughli$wavefunction is solved by Bethe ansatz.
