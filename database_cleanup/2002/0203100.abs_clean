Title: Higher Order Invariants in Supergravity

Authors: Ulf Lindstrom

Comments: 13 pages, Latex. Invited lecture at "Supergravity at 25", Stony

On a historical note, we first describe the early superspace construction ofcounterterms in supergravity and then move on to a brief discussion of selectedareas in string theory where higher order supergravity invariants enter theeffective theories. Motivated by this description we argue that it is importantto understand $p$-brane actions with $\k$-invariant higher order terms, thusre-opening the question of $\k$-invariant ``rigidity'' terms. Finally wedescribe a recent construction of such an action using the superembeddingformalism.
