Title: Supersymmetric webs of D3/D5-branes in supergravity

Authors: Ansar Fayyazuddin

We study webs of D3- and D5-branes in type IIB supergravity. These webspreserve at least 8 supercharges. By solving the Killing spinor equations wedetermine the form of supergravity solutions for the system. We then turn tothe sub-class of the intersecting D3/D5 brane system and elucidate some of itsfeatures.
