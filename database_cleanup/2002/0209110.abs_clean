Intertwining relations for $N$-particle Calogero-like models with internaldegrees of freedom are investigated. Starting from the well knownDunkl-Polychronakos operators, we construct new kind of local (without exchangeoperation) differential operators. These operators intertwine the matrixHamiltonians corresponding to irreducible representations of the permutationgroup $S_N$. In particular cases, this method allows to construct a new classof exactly solvable Dirac-like equations and a new class of matrix models withshape invariance. The connection with approach of multidimensionalsupersymmetric quantum mechanics is established.
