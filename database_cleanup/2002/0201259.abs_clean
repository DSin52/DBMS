We study the extent to which the gauge symmetry of abelian Yang-Mills can bescale. Second, that the deformation preserve supersymmetry. We show that (up toa single parameter) the only allowed deformation is the one determined by thestar product. We then consider the supersymmetry algebra satisfied by NCYMexpressed in commutative variables. The algebra is peculiar since thesupercharges are not gauge-invariant. However, the action, expressed incommutative variables, appears to be quadratic in fermions to all orders intheta.
