We give a worldsheet proof of the equivalence between the U(N) Chern-Simonsgauge theory on S^3 and the topological closed string theory on the resolvedconifold geometry. When the `t Hooft coupling of the gauge theory is small, thedual closed string worldsheet develops a new branch. We show that thefluctuations of the worldsheet into this branch effectively correspond to``holes'' on the worldsheet, generating an open string sector. This leads to amicroscopic description of how the `t Hooft expansion of gauge theoryamplitudes is reproduced in the closed string computation. We find that theclosed string amplitudes also contain terms which are not captured in the `tHooft expansion but are present in the exact computation in the gauge theoryamplitudes. These arise when the whole Riemann surface is in the new branch. Wealso discuss the cases with SO and Sp gauge groups.
