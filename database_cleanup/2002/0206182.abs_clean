We continue and extend our earlier investigation ``Strings in aTime-Dependent Orbifold'' (hep-th/0204168). We formulate conditions for anorbifold to be amenable to perturbative string analysis and classify the lowdimensional orbifolds satisfying these conditions. We analyze the tree andtorus amplitudes of some of these orbifolds. The tree amplitudes exhibit a newkind of infrared divergences which are a result of some ultraviolet effects.These UV enhanced IR divergences can be interpreted as due to back reaction ofthe geometry. We argue that for this reason the three dimensional parabolicorbifold is not amenable to perturbation theory. Similarly, the smooth fourdimensional null-brane tensored with sufficiently few noncompact dimensionsalso appears problematic. However, when the number of noncompact dimensions issufficiently large perturbation theory in these time dependent backgroundsseems consistent.
