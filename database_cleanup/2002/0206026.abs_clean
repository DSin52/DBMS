``Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries'' (SQS01), Karpacz, Poland,September 21-25, 2001. Dubna 2002 pp. 3-10The detailed description of the method of the construction of the nilpotentBRST charges for nonlinear algebras of constraints appearing in the descriptionof the massless higher spin fields on the $AdS_D$ background is presented. Itis shown that the corresponding BRST charge is not uniquely defined, but thisambiguity has no impact on the physical content of the theory.
