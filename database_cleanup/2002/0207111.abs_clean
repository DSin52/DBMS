We study $SO(m)$ covariant Matrix realizations of $ \sum_{i=1}^{m} X_i^2 = 1$ for even $m$ as candidate fuzzy odd spheres following hep-th/0101001. As forthe fuzzy four sphere, these Matrix algebras contain more degrees of freedomthan the sphere itself and the full set of variables has a geometricaldescription in terms of a higher dimensional coset. The fuzzy $S^{2k-1} $ isrelated to a higher dimensional coset $ {SO(2k) \over U(1) \times U(k-1)}$.These cosets are bundles where base and fibre are hermitian symmetric spaces.The detailed form of the generators and relations for the Matrix algebrasrelated to the fuzzy three-spheres suggests Matrix actions which admit thefuzzy spheres as solutions. These Matrix actions are compared with the BFSS,IKKT and BMN Matrix models as well as some others. The geometry andcombinatorics of fuzzy odd spheres lead to some remarks on the transversefive-brane problem of Matrix theories and the exotic scaling of the entropy of5-branes with the brane number.
