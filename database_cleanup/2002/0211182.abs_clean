We describe a new class of supersymmetric string compactifications to 4dMinkowski space. These solutions involve type II strings propagating on(orientifolds of) non Calabi-Yau spaces in the presence of background NS and RRfluxes. The simplest examples have descriptions as cosets, generalizing thethree-dimensional nilmanifold. They can also be thought of as twisted tori. Wederive a formula for the (super)potential governing the light fields, which isgenerated by the fluxes and certain ``twists'' in the geometry. Detailedconsideration of an example also gives strong evidence that in some cases,these exotic geometries are related by smooth transitions to standardCalabi-Yau or G2 compactifications of M-theory.
