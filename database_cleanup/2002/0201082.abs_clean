Title: Gravitational stability of inflatons and torsion in

Einstein-Cartan-Klein-Gordon CosmologyComments: Latex file

Gravitational stability of torsion and inflaton potential in afour-dimensional spacetime de Sitter solution in scalar-tensor cosmology whereCartan torsion propagates is investigated in detail. Inflaton and torsionevolution equations are derived by making use of a Lagrangean method. Stableand unstable modes for torsion and inflatons are found. Present astrophysicalobservations favour a stable mode for torsion since this would explain why norelic torsion imprint has been found on the Cosmic Background Radiation in theuniverse.
