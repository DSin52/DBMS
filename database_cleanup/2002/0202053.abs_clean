A new type of topological matter interactions involving second-rankantisymmetric tensor matter fields with an underlying $N_T \geq 1$ topologicalsupersymmetry are proposed. The construction of the 4-dimensional, $N_T = 1$Donaldson-Witten theory, the $N_T = 1$ super-BF model and the $N_T = 2$topological B-model with tensor matter are explicitly worked out.
