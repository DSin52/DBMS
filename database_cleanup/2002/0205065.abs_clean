Title: The programs of the Extended Relativity in C-spaces

physical foundations of String TheoryComments: 19 pages, Latex file. Invited talk at the NATO advanced workshop on

the nature of time, geometry, physics and perception. Slovakia, May 2002An outline is presented of the Extended Scale Relativity (ESR) in C-spaces(Clifford manifolds), where the speed of light and the minimum Planck scale arethe two universal invariants. This represents in a sense an extension of thetheory developed by L. Nottale long ago. It is shown how all the dimensions ofa C-space can be treated on equal footing by implementing the holographicprinciple associated with a nested family of p-loops of variousdimensionalities. This is achieved by using poly-vector valued coordinates inC-spaces that encode in one stroke points, lines, areas, volumes,... Inaddition, we review the derivation of the minimal-length string uncertaintyrelations; the logarithmic corrections (valid in any dimension) to the blackhole area-entropy relation. We also show how the higher derivative gravity withtorsion and the recent results of kappa-deformed Poincare theories of gravityfollow naturally from the geometry of C-spaces. In conclusion some comments aremade on the cosmological implications of this theory with respect to thecosmological constant problem, the two modes of time, the expansion of theuniverse, number four as the average dimension of our world and a variable finestructure constant.
