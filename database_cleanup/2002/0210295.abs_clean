Title: Light-sheets and Bekenstein's bound

Authors: Raphael Bousso

Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure

From the covariant bound on the entropy of partial light-sheets, we derive aentropy, total mass, and width of any isolated, weakly gravitating system.Because x can be measured along any spatial direction, the bound becomesunexpectedly tight in thin systems. Our result completes the identification ofolder entropy bounds as special cases of the covariant bound. Thus,light-sheets exhibit a connection between information and geometry far moregeneral, but in no respect weaker, than that initially revealed by black holethermodynamics.
