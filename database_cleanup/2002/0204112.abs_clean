Thermodynamics of five-dimensional Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter (SAdS) andSdS black holes in the particular model of higher derivative gravity isconsidered. The free energy, mass (thermodynamical energy) and entropy areevaluated. There exists the parameters region where BH entropy is zero ornegative. The arguments are given that corresponding BH solutions are notstable. We also present the FRW-equations of motion of time (space)-like branesin SAdS or SdS BH background. The properties of dual CFT are discussed and itis shown that it has zero Casimir energy when BH entropy (effectivegravitational constant) is zero. The Cardy-Verlinde formula for CFT dual toSAdS or SdS BH is found in the universal form.
