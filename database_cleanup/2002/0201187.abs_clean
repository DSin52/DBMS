It has been suggested that the observed value of the cosmological constant isrelated to the supersymmetry breaking scale M_{susy} through the formula Lambda\sim M_p^4 (M_{susy}/M_p)^8. We point out that a similar relation naturallyarises in the codimension two solutions of warped space-time varyingcompactifications of string theory in which non-isotropic stringy moduli inducea small but positive cosmological constant.
