The origin of the radiatively induced Lorentz and CPT violations, inperturbative evaluations, of an extended version of QED, is investigated. Usinga very general calculational method, concerning the manipulations andcalculations involving divergent amplitudes, we clearly identify the possiblesources of contributions for the violating terms. We show that consistency inthe perturbative calculations, in a broader sense, leaves no room for theexistence of radiatively induced contributions which is in accordance with whatwas previously conjectured and recently advocated by some authors supported ongeneral arguments.
