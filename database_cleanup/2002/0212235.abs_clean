Title: Comments on Condensates in Non-Supersymmetric Orbifold Field Theories

Authors: David Tong

Comments: 9 Pages

Non-supersymmetric orbifolds of N=1 super Yang-Mills theories are conjecturedto inherit properties from their supersymmetric parent. We examine thisconjecture by compactifying the Z_2 orbifold theories on a spatial circle ofradius R. We point out that when the orbifold theory lies in the weakly coupledvacuum of its parent, fractional instantons do give rise to the conjecturedcondensate of bi-fundamental fermions. Unfortunately, we show that quantumeffects render this vacuum unstable through the generation of twistedoperators. In the true vacuum state, no fermion condensate forms. Thus, incontrast to super Yang-Mills, the compactified orbifold theory undergoes achiral phase transition as R is varied.
