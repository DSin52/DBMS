Title: Quantum gravity as Escher's dragon

Comments: 24 pages LaTeX, 2 figures

The main obstacle in attempts to construct a consistent quantum gravity isthe absence of independent flat time. This can in principle be cured by goingout to higher dimensions. The modern paradigm assumes that the fundamentaltheory of everything is some form of string theory living in space of more thanfour dimensions. We advocate another possibility that the fundamental theory isa form of D=4 higher-derivative gravity. This class of theories has a nicefeature of renormalizability so that perturbative calculations are feasible.There are also finite N=4 supersymmetric conformal supergravity theories. Thispossibility is particularly attractive. Einstein's gravity is obtained in anatural way as an effective low-energy theory. The N=1 supersymmetric versionof the theory has a natural higher-dimensional interpretation due to Ogievetskyand Sokatchev, which involves embedding of our curved Minkowsky space-timemanifold into flat 8-dimensional space. Assuming that a variant of the finiteN=4 theory also admit a similar interpretation, this may eventually allow oneto construct consistent quantum theory of gravity. We argue, however, that eventhough future gravity theory will probably use higher dimensions asconstruction scaffolds, its physical content and meaning should refer to 4dimensions where observer lives.
