The possibility of parity violation in a gravitational theory with torsion isextensively explored in four and higher dimensions. In the former case,we havelisted our conclusions on when and whether parity ceases to be conserved, withboth two-and three-index antisymmetry of the torsion field. In the latter, thebulk spacetime is assumed to have torsion, and the survival of parity-violatingterms in the four dimensional effective action is studied, using thecompactification schemes proposed by Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali andRandall-Sundrum. An interesting conclusion is that the torsion-axion dualityarising in a stringy scenario via the second rank antisymmetric Kalb-Ramondfield leads to conservation of parity in the gravity sector in any dimension.However, parity-violating interactions do appear for spin 1/2 fermions in suchtheories, which can have crucial phenomenological implications.
