We derive two families of supergravity solutions describing D-branes in themaximally supersymmetric Hpp-wave background. The first family of solutionscorresponds to quarter-BPS D-branes. These solutions are delocalised alongcertain directions transverse to the pp-wave. The second family corresponds tothe non-supersymmetric D-branes. These solutions are fully localised. Apeculiar feature of the nonsupersymmetric solutions is that gravity becomesrepulsive close to the core of the D-brane. Both families preserve the amountof supersymmetry predicted by the D-brane probe/CFT analysis. All solutions arewritten in Brinkman coordinates. To construct these kind of solutions it iscrucial to identify the coordinates in which the ansatz looks the simplest. Weargue that the natural coordinates to get the supergravity description of thehalf-BPS branes are the Rosen coordinates.
