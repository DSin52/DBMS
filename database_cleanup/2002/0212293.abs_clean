This paper could have been entitled "D branes and strings from flesh andblood." We study field theoretic prototypes of D branes/strings. To this end weconsider (2+1)-dimensional domain walls in (3+1)-dimensional N=2 SQCD withSU(2) gauge group and two quark flavors in the fundamental representation. Thistheory is perturbed by a small mass term of the adjoint matter which, in theleading order in the mass parameter, does not break N=2 supersymmetry, andreduces to a (generalized) Fayet-Iliopoulos term in the effective low-energyN=2 SQED. We find 1/2 BPS-saturated domain wall solution interpolating betweentwo quark vacua at weak coupling, and show that this domain wall localizes aU(1) gauge field. To make contact with the brane/string picture we consider theAbrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen magnetic flux tube in one of two quark vacua anddemonstrate that it can end on the domain wall. We find an explicit 1/4BPS-saturated solution for the wall/flux tube junction. We verify that the endpoint of the flux tube on the wall plays the role of an electric charge in thedual (2+1)-dimensional SQED living on the wall. Flow to N=1 theory isdiscussed. Our results lead us to a conjecture regarding the notorious "missingwall" in the solution of Kaplunovsky et al.
