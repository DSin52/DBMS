Title: Anomaly-Free Brane Worlds in Seven Dimensions

Authors: Tony Gherghetta and Alex Kehagias

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX; v2

We present an orbifold compactification of the minimal seven dimensionalsupergravity. The vacuum is a slice of AdS_7 where six-branes of oppositetension are located at the orbifold fixed points. The cancellation of gauge andgravitational anomalies restricts the gauge group and matter content on theboundaries. In addition anomaly cancellation fixes the boundary gauge couplingsin terms of the gravitational constant, and the mass parameter of theChern-Simons term.
