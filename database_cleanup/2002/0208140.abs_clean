Vacuum structure and global cosmic strings are analyzed in the effectivetheory of self-interacting O(2) scalar fields on (3+1)-manifolds with conicalsingularities. In the context of one-loop effective action computed byheat-kernel methods with $\zeta$-function regularization, we find aninhomogeneous vacuum of minimum energy and suggest some reason why low-energyglobal strings are likely to be generated at the conical singularities.
