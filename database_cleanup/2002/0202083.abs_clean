Recently, Klemm and others [hep-th/0104141] have successfully generalized theCardy-Verlinde formula for an asymptotically flat spacetime of arbitrarydimensionality. And yet, from a holographic perspective, the interpretation ofthis formula remains somewhat unclear. Nevertheless, in this paper, weincorporate the implied flat space/CFT duality into a study on boundarydescriptions of a $d$-dimensional Schwarzschild-black hole spacetime. Inparticular, we demonstrate that the (presumably) dual CFT adopts a string-likedescription and, moreover, is thermodynamically equivalent to a string thatlives on the stretched horizon of the bulk black hole. Significantly, a similarequivalence has recently been established in both an asymptotically dS and AdScontext. On this basis, we argue that the asymptotically flat Cardy-Verlindeformula does, indeed, have a holographic pedigree.
