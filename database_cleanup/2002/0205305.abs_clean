We deal with the presence of topological defects in models for two realscalar fields. We comment on defects hosting topological defects, and we searchfor explicit defect solutions using the trial orbit method. As we know, undercertain circumstances the second order equations of motion can be solved byfirst order differential equations. In this case we show that the trial orbitmethod can be used very efficiently to obtain explicit solutions.
