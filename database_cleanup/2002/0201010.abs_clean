It has been argued by Witten and others that in the presence of a nontrivialB-field, D-brane charges in type IIB string theories are measured by twistedK-theory. In joint work with Bouwknegt, Carey and Murray it was proved thattwisted K-theory is canonically isomorphic to bundle gerbe K-theory, whoseelements are ordinary vector bundles on a principal projective unitary bundle,with an action of the bundle gerbe determined by the principal projectiveunitary bundle. The principal projective unitary bundle is in turn determinedby the twist. In this paper, we study in more detail the Chern-Weilrepresentative of the Chern character of bundle gerbe K-theory that wasintroduced previously, and we also extend it to the equivariant and holomorphiccases. Included is a discussion of interesting examples.
