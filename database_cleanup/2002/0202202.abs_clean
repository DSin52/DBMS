We study the behaviour of the two- and three-point thermal Green functions,to one loop order in noncommutative U(N) Yang-Mills theory, at temperatures $T$much higher than the external momenta $p$. We evaluate the amplitudes for smalland large values of the variable $\theta p T$ ($\theta$ is the noncommutativeparameter) and exactly compute the static gluon self-energy for all values of$\theta p T$. We show that these gluon functions, which have a leading $T^2$behaviour, are gauge independent and obey simple Ward identities. We argue thatthese properties, together with the results for the lowest order amplitudes,may be sufficient to fix uniquely the hard thermal loop effective action of thenoncommutative theory.
