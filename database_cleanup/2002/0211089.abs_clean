Title: Maximally supersymmetric solutions of ten- and eleven-dimensional

supergravitiesAuthors: Jos\'e Figueroa-O'Farrill and George Papadopoulos

Comments: 24 pages

We classify (up to local isometry) the maximally supersymmetric solutions ofthe eleven- and ten-dimensional supergravity theories. We find that the AdSsolutions, the Hpp-waves and the flat space solutions exhaust them.
