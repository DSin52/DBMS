The fuzzy algebra of S^4 is discussed by quantum deformation. To this end weembed the classical S^4 in the Kaehler coset space SO(5)/U(2). The harmonicfunctions of S^4 are constructed in terms of the complex coordinates ofSO(5)/U(2). Being endowed with the symplectic structure they can be deformed bythe Fedosov formalism. We show that they generate the fuzzy algebra \hatA_\infty (S^4) under the * product defined therein, by using the Darbouxcoordinate system. The fuzzy spheres of higher even dimensions can be discussedsimilarly. We give basic arguments for the generalization as well.
