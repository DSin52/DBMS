Title: Vafa-Witten theorem and Lee-Yang singularities

Authors: M. Aguado, M. Asorey

Comments: 8 pages,a few typos corrected

We show the absence of Lee-Yang singularities in the partition function ofQCD close to the CP symmetric point theta=0 in the complex theta plane.Analyticity of the theta vacuum energy density at theta=0 provides a keymissing link in the Vafa-Witten proof of absence of spontaneous breaking ofparity symmetry in vector-like gauge theories. The result follows fromrenormalizability, unitarity, positivity and existence of BPS bounds.Generalisations of this theorem to other physical systems are also discussedwith particular interest focused on the non-linear CP^N sigma model.
