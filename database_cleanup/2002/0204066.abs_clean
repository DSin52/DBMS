We address the localization of gravity on the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker typebrane embedded in either $AdS_{5}$ or $dS_{5}$ bulk space,and derive twodefinite limits between which the value of the bulk cosmological constant hasto lie in order to localize the graviton on the brane.The lower limit impliesthat the brane should be either $dS_{4}$ or 4d Minkowski in the $AdS_{5}$bulk.The positive upper limit indicates that the gravity can be trapped also oncurved brane in the $dS_{5}$ bulk space.Some implications to recentcosmological scenarios are also discussed.
