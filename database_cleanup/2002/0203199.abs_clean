Noncommutativity in an open string moving in a background Neveu-Schwarz fieldis investigated in a gauge independent Hamiltonian approach, leading to newresults. The noncommutativity is shown to be a direct consequence of thenon-trivial boundary conditions, which, contrary to several approaches, are nottreated as constraints. We find that the noncommutativity persists for allstring points. In the conformal gauge our results reduce to the usualnoncommutativity at the boundaries only.
