We study the problem of vortex solutions in the background of an electricallycharged black string. We show numerically that the Abelian Higgs fieldequations in the background of a four-dimensional black string have vortexsolutions. These solutions which have axial symmetry, show that the blackstring can support the Abelian Higgs field as hair. This situation holds alsoin the case of the extremal black string. We also consider the self-gravity ofthe Abelian Higgs field and show that the effect of the vortex is to induce adeficit angle in the metric under consideration.
