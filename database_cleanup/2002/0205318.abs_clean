We define the notion of energy, and compute its values, for gravitationalsystems involving terms quadratic in curvature. While our constructionparallels that of ordinary Einstein gravity, there are significant differencesboth conceptually and concretely. In particular, for D=4, all purely quadraticmodels admit vacua of arbitrary constant curvature. Their energies, includingthat of conformal (Weyl) gravity, necessarily vanish in asymptotically flatspaces. Instead, they are proportional to that of the Abbott-Deser (AD) energyexpression in constant curvature backgrounds and therefore also proportional tothe mass parameter in the corresponding Schwarzschild-(Anti) de Sittergeometries. Combined Einstein-quadratic curvature systems reflect the abovewith the usual (ADM) energy and no explicit contributions from the quadraticparts. If there is a Lambda term, then the vacuum is also unique with thatLambda value, and the energy is just the sum of the separate contributions fromEinstein and quadratic parts to the AD expression . Finally, we discuss theeffects on energy definition of both higher curvature terms and higherdimension.
