We derive the gauge invariant perturbation equations for a 5-dimensional bulkspacetime in the presence of a brane. The equations are derived in fullgenerality, without specifying a particular energy content of the bulk or thebrane. We do not assume Z_2 symmetry, and show that the degree of freedomassociated with brane motion plays a crucial role. Our formalism may also beused in the Z_2 symmetric case where it simplifies considerably.
