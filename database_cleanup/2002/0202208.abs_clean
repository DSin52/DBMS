We consider orientifolds of Calabi-Yau 3-folds in the context of Type IIA andType IIB superstrings. We show how mirror symmetry can be used to sum upworldsheet instanton contributions to the superpotential for Type IIAsuperstrings. The relevant worldsheets have the topology of the disc and ${\bfRP^2}$.
