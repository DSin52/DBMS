The present theory is based on the assumption that at the very small (Planckscale) distances our space-time is discrete, and this discreteness influenceson the Planck scale physics. Considering our (3+1)-dimensional space-time as aregular hypercubic lattice with a parameter $a=\lambda_\text{P}$, where$\lambda_\text{P}$ is the Planck length, we have investigated a role of latticeartifact monopoles which is essential near the Planck scale if the Familyreplicated gauge group model (FRGGM) is an extension of the Standard Model athigh energies. It was shown that monopoles have $N$ times smaller magneticcharge in FRGGM than in SM ($N$ is the number of families in FRGGM). Thesemonopoles can give an additional contribution to beta-functions of therenormalisation group equations for the running fine structure constants$\alpha_\text{i}(\mu)$ (i=1,2,3 correspond to the U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) gaugegroups of the Standard Model). We have used the Dirac relation for renormalisedelectric and magnetic charges. Also we have estimated the enlargement of anumber of fermions in FRGGM leading to the suppression of the asymptoticfreedom in the non-Abelian theory. Different role of monopoles in the vicinityof the Planck scale gives rise or to AntiGUT, or to the new possibility ofunification of gauge interactions (including gravity) at the scale$\mu_\text{GUT}\approx 10^{18.4}$ GeV. We discussed the possibility of the[SU(5)]$^3$ SUSY or [SO(10)]$^3$ SUSY unifications.
