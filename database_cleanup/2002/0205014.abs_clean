The dependence of the free energy of string theory on the temperature at Tmuch larger than the Hagedorn temperature was found long ago by Atick andWitten and is $F(T)\sim \Lambda T^2$, where $\Lambda$ diverges because of atachyonic instability. We show that this result can be understood assumingthat, above the Hagedorn transition, Poincare' symmetry is deformed into aquantum algebra. Physically this quantum algebra describes a non-commutativespatial geometry and a discrete euclidean time. We then show that in stringtheory this deformed Poincare' symmetry indeed emerges above the Hagedorntemperature from the condensation of vortices on the world-sheet. This resultindicates that the endpoint of the condensation of closed string tachyons withnon-zero winding is an infinite stack of spacelike branes with a givennon-commutative world-volume geometry. On a more technical side, we also pointout that $T$-duality along a circle with antiperiodic boundary conditions forspacetime fermions is broken by world-sheet vortices, and the would-be T-dualvariable becomes non-compact.
