We construct a simple non singular cosmological model in which the currentlyobserved expansion phase was preceded by a contraction. This is achieved, inthe framework of pure general relativity, by means of a radiation fluid and afree scalar field having negative energy. We calculate the power spectrum ofthe scalar perturbations that are produced in such a bouncing model and findthat, under the assumption of initial vacuum state for the quantum fieldassociated with the hydrodynamical perturbation, this leads to a spectral indexn=-1. The matching conditions applying to this bouncing model are derived andshown to be different from those in the case of a sharp transition. We findthat if our bounce transition can be smoothly connected to a slowly contractingphase, then the resulting power spectrum will be scale invariant.
