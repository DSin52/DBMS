A natural extension of the Dijkgraaf-Vafa proposal is to include fields inthe fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this paper we use fieldtheory techniques to analyze gauge theories whose tree level superpotential isa generic polynomial in multi-trace operators constructed out of such fields.We show that the effective superpotential is generated by planar diagrams withat most one (generalized) boundary. This justifies the proposal put forward inhep-th/0211075.We then proceed to extend the gauge theory-matrix model duality to includebaryonic operators. We obtain the full moduli space of vacua for an U(N) theorywith N flavors. We also outline a program leading to a string theoryjustification of the gauge theory-matrix model correspondence with fundamentalmatter.
