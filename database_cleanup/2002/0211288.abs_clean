The boundary states for AdS_2 D-branes in Lorentzian AdS_3 space-time arepresented. AdS_2 D-branes are algebraically defined by twisted Dirichletboundary conditions and are located on twisted conjugacy classes of SL(2,R).Using free field representation of symmetry currents in the SL(2,R) WZNW model,the twisted Dirichlet gluing conditions among currents are translated tomatching conditions among free fields and then to boundary conditions among themodes of free fields. The Ishibashi states are written as coherent states onAdS_3 in the free field formalism and it is shown that twisted Dirichletboundary conditions are satisfied on them. The tree-level amplitude ofpropagation of closed strings between two AdS_2 D-branes is evaluated and bycomparing which to the characters of sl(2,R) Kac-Moody algebra it is shown thatonly states in the principal continuous series representation of sl(2,R)Kac-Moody algebra contributes to the amplitude and thus they are the only onesthat couple to AdS_2 D-branes. The form of the character of sl(2,R) principalcontinuous series and the boundary condition among the zero modes are used todetermine the physical boundary states for AdS_2 D-branes.
