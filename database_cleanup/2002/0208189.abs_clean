In this paper we consider the general setting for constructing ActionPrinciples for three-dimensional first order autonomous equations. We presentthe results for some integrable and non-integrable cases of the Lotka-Volterraequation, and we show Lagrangian descriptions which are valid for systemssatisfying Shil'nikov criteria on the existence of strange attractors, thoughchaotic behavior or homoclinic orbits have not been verified up to now. TheEuler-Lagrange equations we get for these systems usually present "timereparameterization" symmetry, though other kinds of invariance may be foundaccording to the kernel of the associated symplectic 2-form. The formulation ofa Hamiltonian structure (Poisson brackets and Hamiltonians) for these systemsfrom the Lagrangian viewpoint leads to a method of finding new constants of themotion starting from known ones, which is applied to some systems found in theliterature known to possess a constant of the motion, to find the other andthus showing their integrability. In particular, we show that the so-called ABCsystem is completely integrable if it possesses one constant of the motion.
