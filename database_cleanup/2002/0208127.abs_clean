A BPS exact wall solution is found in N=1 supergravity in four dimensions.The model uses chiral scalar field with a periodic superpotential admittingwinding numbers. Maintaining the periodicity in supergravity requires agravitational correction to superpotential which allows the exact solution. Byintroducing boundary cosmological constants, we construct non-BPS multi-wallsolutions for which a systematic analytic approximation is worked out for smallgravitational coupling.
