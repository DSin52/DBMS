Gauge symmetry breaking through the Hosotani mechanism (the dynamics ofnonintegrable phases) in softly broken supersymmetric QCD with $N_F^{fd}$flavors is studied. For $N=$ even, there is a single SU(N) symmetric vacuumstate, while for $N=$ odd, there is a doubly degenerate SU(N) symmetric vacuumstate in the model. We also study generalized supersymmetric QCD by adding$N_F^{adj}$ numbers of massless adjoint matter. The gauge symmetry breakingpattern such as $SU(3)\to SU(2)\times U(1)$ is possible for appropriate choicesof the matter content and values of the supersymmetry breaking parameter. Themassless state of the adjoint Higgs scalar is also discussed in the models.
