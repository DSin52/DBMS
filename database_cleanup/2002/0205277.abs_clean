The vacuum energy for a massless conformally coupled scalar field in a braneworld set up, corresponding to de Sitter branes in a bulk anti-de Sitterspacetime, is calculated. We use the Euclidean version of the metric which canbe conformally related to a metric similar in form to the Einstein universe(S^4 times R). Employing zeta-function regularisation we evaluate the one-loopeffective potential and show that the vacuum energy is zero for the one braneand non-zero for the two brane configuration. We comment on the back-reactionof this Casimir energy and on the inclusion of a mass term or non-conformalcoupling.
