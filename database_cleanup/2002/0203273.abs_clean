In three dimensions, there are two distinct mass-generating mechanisms forChern-Simons (CS), terms. Here we analyze the three-term models where bothtypes are present, and their various limits. Surprisingly, in the tensor case,these seemingly innocuous systems are physically unacceptable. If the sign ofthe Einstein term is ``wrong'' as is in fact required in the CS case, then theexcitation masses are always complex; with the usual sign, there is a (known)region of the two mass parameters where reality is restored, but instead weshow that a ghost problem arises, while, for the ``pure mass'' two-term systemwithout an Einstein action, complex masses are unavoidable. This contrasts withthe smooth behavior of the corresponding vector models. Separately, we showthat the ``partial masslessness'' exhibited by (plain) massive spin-2 models inenjoys a reduced local gauge invariance when this mass parameter is tuned tothe cosmological constant.
