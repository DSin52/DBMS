Orientifolds with three-form flux provide some of the simplest stringexamples of warped compactification. In this paper we show that some models ofthis type have the unusual feature of D=4, N=3 spacetime supersymmetry. Wediscuss their construction and low energy physics. Although the local form ofthe moduli space is fully determined by supersymmetry, to find its global formrequires a careful study of the BPS spectrum.
