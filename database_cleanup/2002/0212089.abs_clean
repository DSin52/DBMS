We clarify aspects of the holographic AdS/CFT correspondence that are typicalof Lorentzian signature, to lay the foundation for a treatment oftime-dependent gravity and conformal field theory phenomena. We provide aderivation of bulk-to-boundary propagators associated to advanced, retarded andFeynman bulk propagators, and provide a better understanding of the boundaryconditions satisfied by the bulk fields at the horizon. We interpret thesubleading behavior of the wavefunctions in terms of specific vacuumexpectation values, and compute two-point functions in our framework. Weconnect our bulk methods to the closed time path formalism in the boundaryfield theory.
