Title: Absence of a charge renormalization in the Higgs model interacting with

conformal two-dimensional gravityAuthors: Z. Haba (Wroclaw University)

We discuss D-dimensional scalar and electromagnetic fields interacting with aquantized metric. The gravitons depend solely on twodimensional coordinates. Weconsider a conformal field theory model for the metric tensor. We show that aninteraction with gravity improves the short distance behaviour. As a resultthere is no charge renormalization in the fourdimensional Higgs model.
