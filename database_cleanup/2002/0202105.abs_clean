We show that it is possible to build up a consistent model describing asuperconducting cosmic string (SCS) endowed with torsion. A full stringsolution is obtained by matching the internal and the external solutions. Wederive the deficit angle, the geodesics of and the gravitational force on atest-particle moving under the action of this screwed SCS. A couple ofcompact objects orbiting torsioned SCS and the accretion of matter onto it.
