The symmetry structure of axion-dilaton quantum string cosmology isinvestigated. The invariance of the string effective action under S-dualitygroup, SU(1,1), facilitates solution of Wheeler-De Witt equation from grouptheoretic considerations; revealing existence of a new class of wave functions.We discover the an underlying ${W}$-infinity algebra in this formulation.
