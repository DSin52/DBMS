and Appendix, and other minor correctionsQuantum vacuum energy has been known to have observable consequences since1948 when Casimir calculated the force of attraction between parallel unchargedplates, a phenomenon confirmed experimentally with ever increasing precision.Casimir himself suggested that a similar attractive self-stress existed for aconducting spherical shell, but Boyer obtained a repulsive stress. Othergeometries and higher dimensions have been considered over the years. Localeffects, and divergences associated with surfaces and edges have been studiedby several authors. Quite recently, Graham et al. have re-examined suchcalculations, using conventional techniques of perturbative quantum fieldtheory to remove divergences, and have suggested that previous self-stressresults may be suspect. Here we show that the examples considered in their workare misleading; in particular, it is well-known that in two dimensions acircular boundary has a divergence in the Casimir energy for massless fields,while for general dimension $D$ not equal to an even integer the correspondingCasimir energy arising from massless fields interior and exterior to ahyperspherical shell is finite. It has also long been recognized that theCasimir energy for massive fields is divergent for $D\ne1$. These conclusionsare reinforced by a calculation of the relevant leading Feynman diagram in $D$and three dimensions. There is therefore no doubt of the validity of theconventional finite Casimir calculations.
