Title: Vacuum energy and relativistic invariance

Comments: LaTeX, 4 pages. Substantial changes to the text; results and

conclusions unchangedIt is argued that the zero-point energies of free quantum fields diverge atmost quadratically and not quartically, as is generally believed. This is aconsequence of the relativistic invariance which requires that the energydensity of the vacuum $\rho$ and its pressure $p$ satisfy $\rho=-p$. Theusually obtained quartic divergence is an artifact of the use of a noninvariantregularization which violates this relation. One consequence of our results isthat the zero-point energies of free massless fields vanish. Implications forthe cosmological constant problem are briefly discussed.
