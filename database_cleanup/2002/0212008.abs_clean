Title: The Geometry of D=11 Killing Spinors

Authors: Jerome P. Gauntlett and Stathis Pakis

Comments: 36 pages. Typos corrected and discussion on SU(5) structures

clarifiedWe propose a way to classify all supersymmetric configurations of D=11supergravity using the G-structures defined by the Killing spinors. We showthat the most general bosonic geometries admitting a Killing spinor have atleast a local SU(5) or an (Spin(7)\ltimes R^8)x R structure, depending onwhether the Killing vector constructed from the Killing spinor is timelike ornull, respectively. In the former case we determine what kind of local SU(5)structure is present and show that almost all of the form of the geometry isdetermined by the structure. We also deduce what further conditions must beimposed in order that the equations of motion are satisfied. We illustrate theformalism with some known solutions and also present some new solutionsincluding a rotating generalisation of the resolved membrane solutions andgeneralisations of the recently constructed D=11 Godel solution.
