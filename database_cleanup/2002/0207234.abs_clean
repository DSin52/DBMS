size of tables reduced, Brane recombination quarantees gauge breaking`homology flow' between six, five and four stack D5 SM quiversWe discuss the appearance of non-supersymmetric compactifications withexactly the Standard Model (SM) at low energies, in the context of IIBorientifold constructions withD5 branes intersecting at angles on the $T^4$ tori, of the orientifold of $T^4\times (\C /Z_N)$.We discuss constructions where the Standard Model embedding is consideringwithin four, five and six stacks of D5 branes. The appearance of the threegeneration observable Standard Model at low energies is accompanied by a gaugedbaryon number, thus ensuring automatic proton stability. Also, a compatibilitywith a low scale of order TeV is ensured by having a two dimensional spacetransverse to all branes. The present models complete the discussion of somerecently constructed four stack models of D5 branes with the SM at low energy.By embedding the four, five and six stack Standard Model configurations intoquiver diagrams, deforming them around the QCD intersection numbers, we find arich variety of vacua that may have exactly the Standard Model at low energy.Also by using brane recombination on the U(1)'s, we show that the five and sixvacua flow into their four stack counterparts. Thus string vacua with five andsix stack deformations are continuously connected to the four stack vacua.
