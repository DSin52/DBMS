We argue that the cosmological constant problem can be solved in a braneworldmodel with infinite-volume extra dimensions, avoiding no-go argumentsapplicable to theories that are four-dimensional in the infrared. Gravity onthe brane becomes higher-dimensional at super-Hubble distances, which entailsthat the relation between the acceleration rate and vacuum energy density flipsupside down compared to the conventional one. The acceleration rate decreaseswith increasing the energy density. The experimentally acceptable rate isobtained for the energy density larger than (1 TeV)$^4$. The results are stableunder quantum corrections because supersymmetry is broken only on the brane andstays exact in the bulk of infinite volume extra space. Consistency of 4Dgravity and cosmology on the brane requires the quantum gravity scale to be(i) simultaneous modifications of gravity at sub-millimeter and the Hubblescales; (ii) Hagedorn-type saturation in TeV energy collisions due to the Reggespectrum with the spacing equal to $10^{-3}$ eV.
