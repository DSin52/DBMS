Time-dependent solutions of supergravity and string theory are studied. Theexamples are obtained from de Sitter deformation of gauge/gravity dualities,analytical continuation of static solutions, and ``exactly solvable''worldsheet models. Among other things, it is shown that turning on a Hubbleparameter in the background of a confining gauge theory in four dimensions canrestore chiral symmetry. Some of the solutions obtained from analyticalcontinuation have the interpretation of a universe with a bounce separating abig bang from a big crunch singularity. In the worldsheet context, it is arguedwhy string propagation close to a Milne-type cosmological singularity might bephysically non-singular.
