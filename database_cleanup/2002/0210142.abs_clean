A family of spherically symmetric, static and self--dual Lorentzian wormholesis obtained in n--dimensional Einstein gravity. This class of solutionsincludes the n--dimensional versions of the Schwarzschild black hole and thespatial--Schwarzschild traversable wormhole. Using isotropic coordinates westudy the geometrical structure of the solution, and delineate the domains ofthe free parameters for which wormhole, naked singular geometries and theSchwarzschild black hole are obtained. It is shown that, in the lowerdimensional Einstein gravity without cosmological constant, we can not haveself--dual Lorentzian wormholes.
