We construct consistent interacting gauge theories for M conformal masslesslimit, each field fulfills the equation ${\cal B}^{\mu \nu} = 0$, where ${\calB}^{\mu \nu}$ is the linearized Bach tensor, (ii) the interactions contain nomore than four derivatives, just as the free action and (iii) the internalmetric for the Weyl gravitons is not positive definite. The interactingtheories are obtained by gauging appropriate non-semi-simple extensions of theconformal algebra $so(4,2)$ with commutative, associative algebras of dimensionM. By writing the action in terms of squares of supercurvatures,supersymmetrization is immediate and leads to consistent conformalsupergravities with M interacting gravitons.
