The Yang-Mills (YM) and self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) equations on thenoncommutative Euclidean four-dimensional space are considered. We introduce anansatz for a gauge potential reducing the noncommutative SDYM equations to adifference form of the Nahm equations. By constructing solutions to thedifference Nahm equations, we obtain solutions of the noncommutative SDYMequations. They are noncommutative generalizations of the known solutions tothe SDYM equations such as the Minkowski solution, the one-instanton solutionand others. Using the noncommutative deformation of the Corrigan-Fairlie-'tHooft-Wilzek ansatz, we reduce the noncommutative YM equations to equations ona scalar field which have meron solutions in the commutative limit and showthat they have no such solutions in the noncommutative case. To overcome thisdifficulty, another ansatz reducing the noncommutative YM equations to a systemof difference equations on matrix-valued functions is used. For self-dualconfigurations this system is reduced to the difference Nahm equations.
