We study the quantum mechanical consistency of noncommutative gauge theoriesby perturbatively analyzing the Wilsonian quantum effective action in thematrix formulation. In the process of integrating out UV states, we find newdivergences having dual UV-IR interpretations and no analogues in ordinaryquantum field theories. The appearance of these new UV-IR divergences hasprofound consequences for the renormalizability of the theory. In particular,renormalizability fails in any nonsupersymmetric noncommutative gauge theory.In fact, we argue that renormalizability generally fails in any noncommutativetheory that allows quantum corrections beyond one-loop. Thus, it seems thatnoncommutative quantum theories are extremely sensitive to the UV, and only thesoftest UV behavior can be tolerated.
