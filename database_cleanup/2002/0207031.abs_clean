A kind of doubly special relativity theory proposed by J. Magueijo and L.Smolin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 190403 (2002)] is analysed. It is shown that thistheory leads to serious physical difficulties in interpretation of kinematicalquantities. Moreover, it is argued that statistical mechanics andthermodynamics cannot be resonably formulate within the model proposed in thementioned paper.
