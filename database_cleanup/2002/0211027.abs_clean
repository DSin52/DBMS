We derive the scalar potential of the effective theory of typeIIB orientifold with 3-form fluxes turned on in presence of non abelian branecoordinates. N=4 supergravity predicts a positive semidefinite potential withvanishing cosmological constant in the vacuum of commuting coordinates, with aclassical moduli space given by three radial moduli and three RR scalars whichcomplete three copies of the coset (U(1,1+n)/U(1)\otimes U(1+n)), together with6n D3-branes coordinates, n being the rank of the gauge group G. Implicationsfor the super Higgs mechanism are also discussed.
