The cosmological constant problem is how one chooses, without fine-tuning,one singular point $\Lambda_{eff}=0$ for the 4D cosmological constant. We arguethat some recently discovered {\it weak self-tuning} solutions can be viewed asblowing-up this one point into a band of some parameter. These weak self-tuningsolutions may have a virtue that only de Sitter space solutions are allowedoutside this band, allowing an inflationary period. We adopt the hybridinflation at the brane to exit from this inflationary phase and to enter intothe standard Big Bang cosmology.
