We study quark confinement in a system of two parallel domain wallsinterpolating different color dielectric media. We use the phenomenologicalapproach in which the confinement of quarks appears considering the QCD vacuumas a color dielectric medium. We explore this phenomenon in QCD$_2$, where theconfinement of the color flux between the domain walls manifests, in a scenariowhere two 0-branes (representing external quark and antiquark) are connected bya QCD string. We obtain solutions of the equations of motion via first-orderdifferential equations. We find a new color confining potential that increasesmonotonically with the distance between the domain walls.
