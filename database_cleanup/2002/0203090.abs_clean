It is shown that Einstein's equations on the brane can be received from themulti-dimensional vector field equations in pseudo-Euclidean space. The idea isbased on the observation that the brane geometry can be equivalently describedby the intrinsic metric or by the derivatives of its normal. From the otherhand the normal to the brane can be constructed with the components of somemulti-dimensional vector fields. For the both cases 4-dimensional effectiveaction for gravity appears to be the same.
