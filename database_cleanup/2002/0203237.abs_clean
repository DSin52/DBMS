We compute the instanton expansions of the holomorphic couplings in theeffective action of certain $\cx N=1$ supersymmetric four-dimensional openstring vacua. These include the superpotential $W(\phi)$, the gauge kineticfunction $f(\phi)$ and a series of other holomorphic couplings which are knownto be related to amplitudes of topological open strings at higher world-sheettopologies. The results are in full agreement with the interpretation of theholomorphic couplings as counting functions of BPS domain walls. Similartechniques are used to compute genus one partition function for the closedtopological string on Calabi--Yau 4-fold which gives rise to a theory with thesame number of supercharges in two dimensions.
