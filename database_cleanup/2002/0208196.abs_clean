We study the late time behavior of the boundary state representing therolling tachyon constructed by Sen. It is found that the coupling of therolling tachyon to massive modes of the closed string grows exponentially asthe system evolves. We argue that the description of rolling tachyon by aboundary state is valid during the finite time determined by string coupling,and that energy could be dissipated to the bulk beyond this time. We alsocomment on the relation between the rolling tachyon boundary state and thespacelike D-brane boundary state.
