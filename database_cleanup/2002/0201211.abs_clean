The relationship between Elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider (RS) andCalogero-Moser (CM) models with Sklyanin algebra is presented. Lax pairrepresentations of the Elliptic RS and CM are reviewed. For n=2 case, theeigenvalue and eigenfunction for Lame equation are found by using the result ofthe Bethe ansatz method.
