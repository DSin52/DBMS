Theories, Solitons and Duality in Sao Paulo in July 2002, 11 pages, JHEP3latex styleThis contribution to the Proceedings of the Workshop on Integrable Theories,Solitons and Duality in Sao Paulo in July 2002 summarizes results from thepapers hep-th/0112023 and math.QA/0208043. We derive the non-local conservedcharges in the sine-Gordon model and affine Toda field theories on thehalf-line. They generate new kinds of symmetry algebras that are coideals ofthe usual quantum groups. We show how intertwiners of tensor productrepresentations of these algebras lead to solutions of the reflection equation.We describe how this method for finding solutions to the reflection equationparallels the previously known method of using intertwiners of quantum groupsto find solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation.
