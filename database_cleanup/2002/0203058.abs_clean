Comments: Note added, post publication. The typical values of the necessary

background electromagnetic field fall well within the range of inter-galacticmagnetic fields. 5pgsJournal-ref: Phys.Lett. B546 (2002) 108

In the presence of an external electromagnetic field an ensemble of shortopen strings in equilibrium with the heat bath provided by the Euclideanworldvolume of a stack of Dbranes undergoes a continuous transition to a longstring phase. The transition temperature is at or below the string scale. Wepoint out that this phenomenon provides a simple mechanism within String Theoryfor the lowering of the strong-electro-weak coupling unification scale by up totwo orders of magnitude relative to the string scale.
