In this work we review some features of topological defects in field theorymodels for real scalar fields. We investigate topological defects in modelsinvolving one and two or more real scalar fields. In models involving a singlefield we examine two different subclasses of models, which support one or moretopological defects. In models involving two or more real scalar fields, weexplore the presence of defects that live inside topological defects, andjunctions and networks of defects. In the case of junctions of defects weinvestigte structures that simulate nanotubes and fulerenes. Our investigationsmay also be used to describe nonlinear properties of polymers, Langmuir filmsand optical solitons in fibers.
