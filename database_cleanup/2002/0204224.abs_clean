A class of spectral problems with a hidden Lie-algebraic structure isconsidered. We define a duality transformation which maps the spectrum of onequasi-exactly solvable (QES) periodic potential to that of another QES periodicpotential. The self-dual point of this transformation corresponds to theenergy-reflection symmetry found previously for certain QES systems. Theduality transformation interchanges bands at the bottom (top) of the spectrumof one potential with gaps at the top (bottom) of the spectrum of the other,dual, potential. Thus, the duality transformation provides an exact mappingbetween the weak coupling (perturbative) and semiclassical (nonperturbative)sectors.
