Proceedings of the meeting of theoretical physicists and mathematicians heldat Strasbourg, May 2002TopologyWe review the string/gauge theory duality relating Chern-Simons theory andtopological strings on noncompact Calabi-Yau manifolds, as well as itsmathematical implications for knot invariants and enumerative geometry.
