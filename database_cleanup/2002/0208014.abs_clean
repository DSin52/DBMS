We describe the construction of configurations of D6-branes wrapped oncompact 3-cycles intersecting at points in non-compact Calabi-Yau threefolds.Such constructions provide local models of intersecting brane worlds, anddescribe sectors of four-dimensional gauge theories with chiral fermions. Wepresent several classes of non-compact manifolds with compact 3-cyclesintersecting at points, and discuss the rules required for model building withwrapped D6-branes. The rules to build 3-cycles are simple, and allow easycomputation of chiral spectra, RR tadpoles and the amount of preservedsupersymmetry. We present several explicit examples of these constructions,some of which have Standard Model like gauge group and three quark-leptongenerations. In some cases, mirror symmetry relates the models to otherconstructions used in phenomenological D-brane model building, like D-branes atsingularities. Some simple N=1 supersymmetric configurations may lead torelatively tractable G_2 manifolds upon lift to M-theory, which would benon-compact but nevertheless yield four-dimensional chiral gauge fieldtheories.
