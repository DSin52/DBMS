We discuss the lift of certain D6-antiD6-brane systems to M-theory. These arepurely gravitational configurations with a bolt singularity. When reduced alonga trivial circle, and for large bolt radius, the bolt is related to anon-supersymmetric orbifold type of singularity where some closed stringtachyons are expected in the twisted sectors. This is a kind of open-closedstring duality that relates open string tachyons on one side and localisedtachyons in the other. We consider the evolution of the system of branes fromM-theory point of view. This evolution gives rise to a brane-antibraneannihilation on the brane side. On the gravity side, the evolution is relatedto a reduction of the order of the orbifold and to a contraction of the bolt toa nut or flat space if the system has non-vanishing or vanishing charge,respectively. We also consider the inverse process of reducing anon-supersymmetric orbifold to a D6-brane system. For $C^2/Z_N\times Z_M$, thereduced system is a fractional D6-brane at an orbifold singularity $C/Z_M$.
