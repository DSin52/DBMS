Title: Stringy Instability of Topologically Non-Trivial Ads Black Holes and of

desitter S-Brane SpacetimesAuthors: Brett McInnes

speculations discardedSeiberg and Witten have discussed a specifically "stringy" kind ofinstability which arises in connection with "large" branes in asymptoticallyAdS spacetimes. It is easy to see that this instability actually arises in mostfive-dimensional asymptotically AdS black hole string spacetimes withnon-trivial horizon topologies. We point out that this is a more seriousproblem than it may at first seem, for it cannot be resolved even by takinginto account the effect of the branes on the geometry of spacetime. [It isultimately due to the {\em topology} of spacetime, not its geometry.] Next,assuming the validity of some kind of dS/CFT correspondence, we argue thatasymptotically deSitter versions of the Hull-Strominger-Gutperle S-branespacetimes are also unstable in this "topological" sense, at least in the casewhere the R-symmetries are preserved. We conjecture that this is due to theunrestrained creation of "late" branes, the spacelike analogue of large branes,at very late cosmological times.
