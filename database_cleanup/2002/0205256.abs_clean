Statistical systems displaying a strongly anisotropic or dynamical scalingbehaviour are characterized by an anisotropy exponent theta or a dynamicalexponent z. For a given value of theta, we construct local scaletransformations which can be viewed as scale transformations with aspace-time-dependent dilatation factor. Two distinct types of local scaletransformations are found. The first type may describe strongly anisotropicscaling of static systems with a given value of theta, whereas the second typemay describe dynamical scaling with a dynamical exponent z. Local scaletransformations act as a dynamical symmetry group of certain non-localfree-field theories. Known special cases of local scale invariance areconformal invariance for theta=1 and Schrodinger invariance for theta=2. Thehypothesis of local scale invariance implies that two-point functions ofquasiprimary operators satisfy certain linear fractional differentialequations, which are constructed from commuting fractional derivatives. Theexplicit solution of these yields exact expressions for two-point correlatorsat equilibrium and for two-point response functions out of equilibrium.Aparticularly simple and general form is found for the two-time autoresponsefunction. These predictions are explicitly confirmed at the uniaxial Lifshitzpoints in the ANNNI and ANNNS models and in the aging behaviour of simpleferromagnets such as the kinetic Glauber-Ising model and the kinetic sphericalmodel with a non-conserved order parameter undergoing either phase-orderingkinetics or non-equilibrium critical dynamics.
