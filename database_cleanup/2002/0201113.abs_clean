Authors: Matthias R Gaberdiel

Comments: 19 pages, LaTeX, 4 figures; to appear in the Proceedings of the RTN

meeting `The Quantum Structure of Spacetime and the Geometric Nature ofAn introduction to the construction of D-branes using conformal field theorymethods is given. A number of examples are discussed in detail, in particularthe construction of all conformal D-branes for the theory of a single freeboson on a circle.
