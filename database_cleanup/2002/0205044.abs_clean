Title: Abelian matrix models in two loops

Comments: 16 pages LaTeX

We perform a two-loop calculation of the effective Lagrangian for thelow--energy modes of the quantum mechanical system obtained by dimensionalreduction from 4D, N = 1 supersymmetric QED. The bosonic part of the Lagrangiandescribes the motion over moduli space of vector potentials A_i endowed with anontrivial conformally flat metric. We determined the coefficient of thetwo-loop correction to the metric, which is proportional to 1/A^6. For thematrix model obtained from Abelian 4D, N = 2 theory, this correction vanishes,as it should.
