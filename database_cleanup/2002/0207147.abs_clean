We derive general formulae for the first order variation of the ADM mass,angular momentum for linear perturbations of a stationary background inEinstein-Maxwell axion-dilaton gravity being the low-energy limit of theheterotic string theory. All these variations were expressed in terms of theperturbed matter energy momentum tensor and the perturbed charge currentdensity. Combining these expressions we reached to the form of the {\itphysical version} of the first law of black hole dynamics for the stationaryblack holes in the considered theory being the strong support for the cosmiccensorship.
