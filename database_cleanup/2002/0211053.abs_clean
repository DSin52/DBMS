Title: On Maximal-Acceleration, Strings and the Group of Minimal Planck-Area

Relativity TheoryComments: 21 pages, Latex file

Recently we have presented a new physical model that links the maximum speedof light with the minimal Planck scale into a maximal-acceleration Relativityprinciple in phase spaces . The maximal proper-acceleration bound is $a = c^2/\Lambda$ where $ \Lambda$ is the Planck scale. The group transformation laws ofthis Maximal-acceleration Relativity theory under velocity and accelerationboosts are analyzed in full detail. For pure acceleration boosts it is shownthat the minimal Planck-areas (maximal tension) are universal invariantquantities in any frame of reference. The implications of this minimalPlanck-area (maximal tension) principle in future developments of stringtheory, $ W$-geometry and Quantum Gravity are briefly outlined.
