We study the finite size corrections for the magnetization and the internalenergy of the 2d Ising model in a magnetic field by using transfer matrixtechniques. We compare these corrections with the functional form recentlyproposed by Delfino and LeClair-Mussardo for the finite temperature behaviourof one-point functions in integrable 2d quantum field theories. We find aperfect agreement between theoretical expectations and numerical results.Assuming the proposed functional form as an input in our analysis we obtain arelevant improvement in the precision of the continuum limit estimates of bothquantities.
