Within D=5 N=2 gauged supergravity coupled to hypermultiplets we deriveconsistency conditions for BPS domain walls with constant negative curvature onthe wall. For such wall solutions to exist, the covariant derivative of theprojector, governing the constraint on the Killing spinor, has to be non-zeroand proportional to the cosmological constant on the domain walls. We alsoprove that in this case solutions of the Killing spinor equations are solutionsof the equations of motion. We present explicit, analytically solved examplesof such domain walls, employing the universal hypermultiplet fields. Theseexamples involve the running of two scalar fields and the space-time in thetransverse direction that is cut off at a critical distance, governed by themagnitude of the negative cosmological constant on the wall.
