We analyse the classical decay process of unstable D-branes in superstringtheory using the boundary string field theory (BSFT) action. We show that thesolutions of the equations of motion for the tachyon field asymptoticallyapproach to T=x^0 and the pressure rapidly falls off at late time producing thetachyon matter irrespective of the initial condition. We also consider thecosmological evolution driven by the rolling tachyon using the BSFT action asan effective action.
