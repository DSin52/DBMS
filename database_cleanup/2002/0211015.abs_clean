A first-quantized string (and membrane) theory is developed here by using ageneral wave function of the string (and membrane), analogously to thefirst-quantized quantum theory of a point particle. From the general wavefunction of the string (and membrane), the properties of the string (andmembrane) such as its relation to Bosons, Fermions and spacetime areinvestigated. The string and membrane wave functions are found to be veryuseful and we can deduce Klein-Gordon equation, Dirac equation and thefundamental property of the spacetime from this new starting point.
