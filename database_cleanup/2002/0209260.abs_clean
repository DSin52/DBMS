We explore how various anomaly-cancelling terms in M-theory and string theorytransform non-trivially into each other under duality. Specifically, we studythe phenomenon in which bulk terms in M-theory get mapped to brane worldvolumeterms in string theory. The key mathematical ingredient is G-index theory.
