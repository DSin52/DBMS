Symposium (Karpacz, Poland, September 21-25, 2001), Eds E. Ivanov, S.Krivonos, J. Lukierski and A. Pashnev (Dubna, JINR, 2002); pp 86-95We review the relations between a family of domain-wall solutions to M-theoryand gravitational instantons with special holonomy. When oxidized into themaximal-dimension parent supergravity, the transverse spaces of these domainwalls become cohomogeneity-one spaces with generalized Heisenberg symmetriesand a homothetic conformal symmetry. These metrics may also be obtained asscaling limits of generalized Eguchi-Hanson metrics, or, with appropriatediscrete identifications, from generalized Atiyah-Hitchin metrics, thusproviding field-theoretic realizations of string-theory orientifolds.
