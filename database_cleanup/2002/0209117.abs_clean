Title: Solitons for the fuzzy sphere from matrix model

Authors: Paolo Valtancoli

Comments: 20 pages, LaTeX, no figures

Recently we have introduced a matrix model depending on two couplingconstants $g^2$ and $\lambda$, which contains the fuzzy sphere as a background;to obtain the classical limit $g^2$ must depend on $N$ in a precise way. Inthis paper we show how to obtain the classical solitons of the $N \to \infty$limit imposing the development $\lambda = \half + \frac{\lambda_0}{N}$; as aconsequence at finite $N$ one obtains a noncommutative version of the solitonsfor the fuzzy sphere.
