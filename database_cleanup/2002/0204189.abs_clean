We study a quotient Conformal Field Theory, which describes a 3+1 dimensionalcosmological spacetime. Part of this spacetime is the Nappi-Witten (NW)universe, which starts at a ``big bang'' singularity, expands and thencontracts to a ``big crunch'' singularity at a finite time. The gauged WZWmodel contains a number of copies of the NW spacetime, with each copy connectedto the preceeding one and to the next one at the respective big bang/big crunchsingularities. The sequence of NW spacetimes is further connected at thesingularities to a series of non-compact static regions with closed timelikecurves. These regions contain boundaries, on which the observables of thetheory live. This suggests a holographic interpretation of the physics.
