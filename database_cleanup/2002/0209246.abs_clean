We consider the one-dimensional XXX spin 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet atzero temperature and zero magnetic field. We are interested in a probability offormation of a ferromagnetic string in the antiferromagnetic ground-state. Wecall it emptiness formation probability [EFP]. We suggest a new technique forcomputation of EFP in the inhomogeneous case. It is based on quantumKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. We evalauted EFP for strings of the length sixin the inhomogeneous case. The homogeneous limit confirms our hypothesis aboutthe relation of quantum correlations to number theory. We also make aconjecture about a general structure of EFP for arbitrary lenght of the string
