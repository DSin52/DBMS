We study the superconformal and super-BRS invariance of the supersymmetricWess-Zumino-Witten model based on Lie superalgebra. The computation of thecritical super-dimension of this model is done using the Fujikawaregularization. Finally, we recover the well-known result which fixes therelative coupling constant a2 = 1 in a rigorous way.
