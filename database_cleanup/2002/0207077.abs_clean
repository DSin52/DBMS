We study the classification of D-branes in all compact Lie groups includingnon-simply-laced ones. We also discuss the global structure of the quantummoduli space of the D-branes. D-branes are classified according to theirpositions in the maximal torus. We describe rank 2 cases, namely $B_2$, $C_2$,$G_2$, explicitly and construct all the D-branes in $B_r$, $C_r$, $F_4$ by themethod of iterative deletion in the Dynkin diagram. The discussion of modulispace involves global issues that can be treated in terms of the exact homotopysequence and various lattices. We also show that singular D-branes can exist atquantum mechanical level.
