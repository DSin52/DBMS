We discuss a D-dimensional Euclidean scalar field interacting with a scaleinvariant quantized metric. We assume that the metric depends on d-dimensionalcoordinates where d<D. We show that the interacting quantum fields have moreregular short distance behaviour than the free fields. A model of a Gaussianmetric is discussed in detail. In particular, in the \Phi^4 theory in fourdimensions we obtain explicit lower and upper bounds for each term of theperturbation series. It turns out that there is no coupling constantrenormalization in the \Phi^4 model in four dimensions. We show that in aparticular range of the scale dimension there are models in D=4 without anydivergencies.
