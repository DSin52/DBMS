the Moriond cosmology meeting held at Les Arcs, France (March 16-23, 2002)With the new cosmological data gathered over the last few years, theinflationary paradigm has seen its predictions largely unchallenged. A recentproposal, called the ekpyrotic scenario, was argued to be a viable competitoras it was claimed that the spectrum of primordial perturbations it produces isscale invariant. By investigating closely this scenario, we show that thecorresponding spectrum depends explicitly on an arbitrary function ofwavenumber and is therefore itself arbitrary. It can at will be set scaleinvariant. We conclude that the scenario is not predictive at this stage.
