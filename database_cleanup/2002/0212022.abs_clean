Title: A Polynomial Weyl Invariant Spinning Membrane Action

Comments: 7 pages, Latex file

A review of the construction of a Weyl-invariant spinning-membrane actionthat is $polynomial$ in the fields, without a cosmological constant term,comprised of quadratic and quartic-derivative terms, and where supersymmetry islinearly realized, is presented. The action is invariant under a $modified$supersymmetry transformation law which is derived from a new $ Q + K + S $sum-rule based on the 3D-superconformal algebra .
