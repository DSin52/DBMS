In an attempt to study asymptotically plane wave spacetimes which admit anevent horizon, we find solutions to vacuum Einstein's equations in arbitrarydimension which have a globally null Killing field and rotational symmetry. Weshow that while such solutions can be deformed to include ones which areasymptotically plane wave, they do not posses a regular event horizon. If weallow for additional matter, such as in supergravity theories, we show that itis possible to have extremal solutions with globally null Killing field, aregular horizon, and which, in addition, are asymptotically plane wave. Inparticular, we deform the extremal M2-brane solution in 11-dimensionalsupergravity so that it behaves asymptotically as a 10-dimensional vacuum planewave times a real line.
