Schwarzschild Black Holes from Microscopic Chains on Euclidean BranesAuthors: Axel Krause

We study the thermodynamic consequences of a recently proposed chaindescription for a Schwarzschild black hole arising from two mutually orthogonalEuclidean D3-antiD3 brane-antibrane pairs. A discrete mass-spectrum ofBekenstein-type is inferred and it is shown that the chain's temperaturecoincides exactly with the Hawking-temperature. Likewise the chain's specificheat is shown to agree with the black hole result. Moreover, non-trivialcorrections to both Hawking-temperature and specific heat are obtained.
