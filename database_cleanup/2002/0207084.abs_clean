Title: Black Holes in brane worlds

Authors: P.Suranyi and L.C.R.Wijewardhana

Comments: 8 pages

In a Randall-Sundrum theory (RS1) 3+1 dimensional black holes and higherdimensional black holes are not the natural continuations of each other. 3+1dimensional black holes decay into a large number of 4+1 dimensional blackholes at a critical mass, $M_{\rm crit}\sim 10^{32}$ TeV. Those black holesthemselves may become unstable above another, albeit much smaller criticalmass, $M_0\sim 10^3$TeV.
