Solvable and Integrable SystemsWe construct the classical W-algebras for some non-abelian Toda systemsassociated with the Lie groups GL(2n,R) and Sp(n,R). We start with the set ofcharacteristic integrals and find the Poisson brackets for the correspondingHamiltonian counterparts. The convenient block matrix representation for theToda equations is used. The infinitesimal symmetry transformations generated bythe elements of the W-algebras are presented.
