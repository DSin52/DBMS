correctedThe well-known Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) monopole is considered inthe limit of the infinite mass of the Higgs field as a basis of the Yang-Millsfield vacuum with the finite energy density. In this limit, the Higgs fielddisappears, but it leaves its traces as the BPS monopole transforms into theWu-Yang monopole obtained in the pure Yang-Mills theory by a spontaneous scalesymmetry breaking in the class of functions with the zero value of atopological charge. The topological degeneration of the BPS monopole manifestsitself as the Gribov copies of the covariant Coulomb gauge in the form of thetime integral of the Gauss constraint. We also show that in the theory there isa zero mode of the Gauss constraint leading to an electric monopole and anadditional mass of eta_0-meson in QCD. The consequences of the monopole vacuumin the form of a rising potential and topological confinement are studied inthe framework of the perturbation theory. An estimation of the vacuumexpectation value of the square of the magnetic tension is given through theeta_0-meson mass, and arguments in favour of the stability of the monopolevacuum are considered. We also discuss why all these "smiles" of the Cheshirecat are kept by the Dirac fundamental quantization, but not the conventionalFaddeev-Popov integral.
