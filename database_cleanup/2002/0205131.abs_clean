We treat free large N superconformal field theories as holographic duals ofhigher spin (HS) gauge theories expanded around AdS spacetime with radius R.The HS gauge theories contain massless and light massive AdS fields. The HScurrent correlators are written in a crossing symmetric form including onlyexchange of other HS currents. This and other arguments point to the existenceof a consistent truncation to massless HS fields. A survey of massless HStheories with 32 supersymmetries in D=4,5,7 (where the 7D results are new) isgiven and the corresponding composite operators are discussed. In the case ofAdS_4, the cubic couplings of a minimal bosonic massless HS gauge theory aredescribed. We examine high energy/small tension limits giving rise to masslessHS fields in the Type IIB string on AdS_5 x S^5 and M theory on AdS_{4/7} xS^{7/4}. We discuss breaking of HS symmetries to the symmetries of ordinarysupergravity, and a particularly natural Higgs mechanism in AdS_5 x S^5 andAdS_4 x S^7 where the HS symmetry is broken by finite g_{YM}. In AdS_5 x S^5 itis shown that the supermultiplets of the leading Regge trajectory cross overinto the massless HS spectrum. We propose that g_{YM}=0 corresponds to acritical string tension of order 1/R^2 and a finite string coupling of order1/N. In AdS_7 x S^4 we give a rotating membrane solution coupling to themassless HS currents, and describe these as limits of Wilson surfaces in theA_{N-1}(2,0) SCFT, expandable in terms of operators with anomalous dimensionsthat are asymptotically small for large spin. The minimal energy configurationshave semi-classical energy E=s for all s and the geometry of infinitelystretched strings with energy and spin density concentrated at the endpoints.
