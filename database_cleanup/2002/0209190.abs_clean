As part of a programme for the general study of the low-energy implicationsof supersymmetry breaking in brane-world scenarios, we study the nonlinearrealization of supersymmetry which occurs when breaking N=2 to N=1supergravity. We consider three explicit realizations of this supersymmetrybreaking pattern, which correspond to breaking by one brane, by one antibraneor by two (or more) parallel branes. We derive the minimal field content, theeffective action and supersymmetry transformation rules for the resulting N=1theory perturbatively in powers of kappa = 1/M_{Planck}. We show that the waythe massive gravitino and spin-1 fields assemble into N=1 multiplets impliesthe existence of direct brane-brane contact interactions at order O(kappa).This result is contrary to the O(kappa^2) predicted by the sequesteringscenario but in agreement with recent work of Anisimov et al. Our low-energyapproach is model independent and is a first step towards determining thelow-energy implications of more realistic brane models which completely breakall supersymmetries.
