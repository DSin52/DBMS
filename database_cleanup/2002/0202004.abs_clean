Title: Environmentally Friendly Renormalization Group and Phase Transitions

Authors: F. Astorga

Comments: Parallel Talk at COSMO-01 Workshop, Rovaniemi, Finland,

August30-September4, 2001. 3 pages, LaTeXWe discuss an environmentally friendly renormalization group approach toanalyze phase transitions. We intend to apply this method to the ElectroweakPhase Transition. This work is in progress. We present some previously obtainedresults concerning a scalar theory, where the main features of this algorithmare introduced.
