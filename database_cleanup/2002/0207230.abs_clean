We present a non-perturbative regularization scheme for Quantum FieldTheories which amounts to an embedding of the originally unregularized theoryinto a spacetime with an extra compactified dimensions of length L ~Lambda^{-1} (with Lambda an ultraviolet cutoff), plus a doubling in the numberof fields, which satisfy different periodicity conditions and have oppositeGrassmann parity. The resulting regularized action may be interpreted, for thefermionic case, as corresponding to a finite-temperature theory with asupersymmetry, which is broken because of the boundary conditions. We test ourproposal in a perturbative calculation (the vacuum polarization graph for aD-dimensional fermionic theory) and in a non-perturbative one (the chiralanomaly).
