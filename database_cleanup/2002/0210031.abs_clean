In the present work we investigate temperature effects on the spinor andscalar effetive QED in the context of Thermo Field Dynamics. FollowingWeisskopf's zero-point energy method, the problem of charge renormalization isreexamined and high temperature contributions are extracted from the thermalcorrection for the Lagrangian densities. Divergent quantites are regularizedaccording to Pauli-Villars-Rayski prescription.
