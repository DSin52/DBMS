Following a recent study by Das and Pernice [Nucl. Phys. B561, (1999) 357],we have carefully analyzed the half-harmonic oscillator. In contrast to theirobservations, our analysis reveals that the spectrum does not allow for a zeroenergy ground state and hence the supersymmetry is broken when the domain isrestricted to the positive half of the real axis.
