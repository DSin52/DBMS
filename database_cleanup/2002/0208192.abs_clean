Quantum gravity phenomenology opens up the possibility of probing Planckscale physics. Thus, by exploiting the generic properties that a semiclassicalstate of the compound system fermions plus gravity should have, an effectivedynamics of spin-1/2 particles is obtained within the framework of loop quantumgravity. Namely, at length scales much larger than Planck length and below thewave length of the fermion, the spin-1/2 dynamics in flat spacetime includesPlanck scale corrections. In particular we obtain modified dispersion relationsin vacuo for fermions. These corrections yield a time of arrival delay of thespin 1/2 particles with respect to a light signal and, in the case ofneutrinos, a novel flavor oscillation. To detect these effects thecorresponding particles must be highly energetic and should travel longdistances. Hence Neutrino Bursts accompanying Gamma Ray Bursts or ultra highenergy cosmic rays could be considered. Remarkably, future neutrino telescopesmay be capable to test such effects. This paper provides a detailed account ofthe calculations and elaborates on results previously reported in a Letter.These are further amended by introducing a real parameter Upsilon aimed atencoding our lack of knowledge of scaling properties of the gravitationaldegrees of freedom.
