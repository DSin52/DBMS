Title: Quantum Gravity with the Standard Model

Comments: 16 pages, LaTeX, v2

A unified theory of four-dimensional gravity together with the standard modelis presented, with supersymmetry breaking of M-theory at a TeV. Masses of thethe known particles are derived. The cosmological constant is quantum generatedto the observed value. Quantum corrections to the classical compactificationare analyzed, and the scenario is stable.
