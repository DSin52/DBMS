Authors: Shinsuke Kawai

Comments: 38 pages, 4 figures, LaTeX. Notes of lectures at the International

Summer School on Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory and its Applications,Sept. 2001, IPM, Tehran. Typos fixedThis lecture note covers topics on boundary conformal field theory, modulartransformations and the Verlinde formula, and boundary logarithmic CFT. Anintroductory review on CFT with boundary and a discussion of its applicationsto logarithmic cases are given. LCFT at $c=-2$ is mainly discussed.
