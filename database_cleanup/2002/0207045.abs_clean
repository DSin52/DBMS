In this paper we consider the presence of the Wu-Yang magnetic monopole inthe global monopole spacetime and their influence on the vacuum polarizationeffects around these two monopoles placed together. According to Wu-Yang [Nucl.Phys. {\bf B107}, 365 (1976)] the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in suchan external field will not be an ordinary function but, instead, {\it section}.Because of the peculiar radial symmetry of the global monopole spacetime, it ispossible to cover its space section by two overlapping regions, needed todefine the singularity free vector potential, and to study the quantum effectsdue to a charged scalar field in this system. In order to develop this analysiswe construct the explicit Euclidean scalar Green {\it section} associated witha charged massless field in a global monopole spacetime in the presence of theAbelian Wu-Yang magnetic monopole. Having this Green section it is possible tostudy the vacuum polarization effects. We explicitly calculate the renormalizedvacuum expectation value $<\Phi(x)^*\Phi(x) >_{Ren.}$, associated with acharged scalar field operator and the respective energy-momentum tensor,$<T_{\mu\nu}(x)>_{Ren.}$, which are expressed in terms of the parameter whichcodify the presence of the global and magnetic monopoles.
