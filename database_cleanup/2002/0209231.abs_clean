Free scalar fields in de Sitter space have a one-parameter family of statesinvariant under the de Sitter group, including the standard thermal vacuum. Weshow that, except for the thermal vacuum, these states are unphysical whengravitational interactions are included. We apply these observations to thequantum state of the inflaton, and find that, at best, dramatic fine tuning isrequired for states other than the thermal vacuum to lead to observablefeatures in the CMBR anisotropy.
