We present, in explicit matrix representation and a modernity befitting thecommunity, the classification of the finite discrete subgroups of G_2 andcompute the McKay quivers arising therefrom. Of physical interest are theclasses of N=1 gauge theories descending from M-theory and of mathematicalinterest are possible steps toward a systematic study of crepant resolutions tosmooth G_2 manifolds as well as generalised McKay Correspondences. This writingis a companion monograph to hep-th/9811183 and hep-th/9905212, wherein theanalogues for Calabi-Yau three- and four-folds were considered.
