Title: D-branes, Orientifolds and K-theory

Authors: B. Stefanski, jr

Comments: 6 pages, to appear in the proceedings of the RTN meeting ``The

Quantum Structure of Spacetime and the Geometric Nature of FundamentalInteractions'', (Corfu, September 2001)The complete D-brane spectrum in $\Zop_2$ orientifolds is computed. Stablenon-BPS D-branes with both integral and torsion charges are found. The relationto K-theory is discussed and a new K-theory relevant to orientifolds issuggested.
