We present a new approach for generation of solutions in the four-dimensionalheterotic string theory with one vector field and in the five-dimensionalbosonic string theory starting from the static Einstein-Maxwell fields. Ourapproach allows one to construct the solution classes invariant with respect tothe total subgroup of the three-dimensional charging symmetries of these stringtheories. The new generation procedure leads to the extremalIsrael-Wilson-Perjes subclass of string theory solutions in a special case andprovides its natural continuous extension to the realm of non-extremalsolutions. We explicitly calculate all string theory solutions related tothree-dimensional gravity coupled to an effective dilaton field which arisesafter an appropriate charging symmetry invariant reduction of the staticEinstein-Maxwell system.
