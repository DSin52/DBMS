M-theory on the maximally supersymmetric plane wave background ofeleven-dimensional supergravity admits spherical BPS transverse M5-branes withzero light-cone energy. We give direct evidence that the single M5-brane statecorresponds to the trivial (X=0) classical vacuum in the large N limit of theplane wave matrix theory. In particular, we show that the linear fluctuationspectrum of the spherical fivebrane matches exactly with the set of exactlyprotected excited states about the X=0 vacuum in the matrix model. These statesinclude geometrical fluctuations of the sphere, excitations of the worldvolumetwo-form field, and fermion excitations. In addition, we propose a descriptionof multiple fivebrane states in terms of matrix model vacua.Finally, we discuss how to obtain the continuum D2/M2 and NS5/M5 theories onspheres from the matrix model. The matrix model can be viewed as aregularization for these theories.
