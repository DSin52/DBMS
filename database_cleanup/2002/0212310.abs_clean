We discuss the vacuum energy density and the cosmological constant of thedS$_5$ brane world with dilaton and radion fields. It is shown that a stableAdS$_4$ brane can be constructed. An explicit relation between the cosmologicalconstants of dS$_5$ spacetime and AdS$_4$ brane is obtained. The discrete massspectrum in the AdS$_4$ brane is used to acquire the brane vacuum energydensity. The cosmological constant in the brane world gotten by this method isin agreement with astronomical observations.
