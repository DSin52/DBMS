Title: Quantum Field Theory and Representation Theory

Authors: Peter Woit (Dept. of Mathematics, Columbia University)

A sketch is given of a circle of ideas relating quantum field theories withrepresentation theory. The main mathematical ingredients are spinor geometryand the gauge group equivariant K-theory of the space of connections.
