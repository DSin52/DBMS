We consider a supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory with matter fields in theadjoint, fundamental and anti-fundamental representations. As in the frameworkwhich was put forward by Dijkgraaf and Vafa, this theory can be described by amatrix model. We analyze this theory along the lines of [F. Cachazo,M. Douglas, N.S. and E. Witten, ``Chiral Rings and Anomalies in SupersymmetricGauge Theory'' hep-th/0211170] and show the equivalence of the gauge theory andthe matrix model. In particular, the anomaly equations in the gauge theory isidentified with the loop equations in the matrix model.
