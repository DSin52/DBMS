We review aspects of quantisation of the 11-dimensional supermembrane worldvolume theory. We explicitly construct vertex operators for the massless statesand study interactions of supermembranes. The open supermembrane and its vertexoperators are discussed. We show how our results have direct applications toMatrix theory by appropriate regularisation of the supermembrane.
