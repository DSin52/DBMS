Comments: LaTeX, 30 pages, minor changes in the abstract and text, Comment on

the quasi-topological nature of the 2-form field is addedWe discuss the (dual-)gauge transformations and BRST cohomology for the two$(1 + 1)$-dimensional (2D) free Abelian one-form and four ($3 + 1)$-dimensional(4D) free Abelian 2-form gauge theories by exploiting the (co-)BRST symmetries(and their corresponding generators) for the Lagrangian densities of thesetheories. For the 4D free 2-form gauge theory, we show that the changes on theantisymmetric polarization tensor $e^{\mu\nu} (k)$ due to (i) the (dual-)gaugetransformations corresponding to the internal symmetry group, and (ii) thetranslation subgroup T(2) of the Wigner's little group, are connected witheach-other for the specific relationships among the parameters of thesetransformation groups. In the language of BRST cohomology defined w.r.t. theconserved and nilpotent (co-)BRST charges, the (dual-)gauge transformed states(that are connected with the transformations on the polarization tensor by thetranslation subgroup of the Wigner's little group) turn out to be the sum ofthe original state and the (co-)BRST exact states. We comment on (i) thequasi-topological nature of the 4D free 2-form gauge theory from the degrees offreedom count on $e^{\mu\nu} (k)$, and (ii) the Wigner's little group and theBRST cohomology for the 2D one-form gauge theory {\it vis-{\`a}-vis} ouranalysis for the 4D 2-form gauge theory.
