In recent papers, it has been shown that (i) the dynamics of theoriesinvolving gravity can be described, in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity,as a billiard motion in a region of hyperbolic space bounded by hyperplanes;and (ii) that the relevant billiard has remarkable symmetry properties in thecase of pure gravity in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions, or supergravity theories in10 or 11 spacetime dimensions, for which it turns out to be the fundamentalWeyl chamber of the Kac-Moody algebras $AE_d$, $E_{10}$, $BE_{10}$ or $DE_{10}$(depending on the model). We analyse in this paper the billiards associated toother theories containing gravity, whose toroidal reduction to three dimensionsinvolves coset models $G/H$ (with $G$ maximally non compact). We show that ineach case, the billiard is the fundamental Weyl chamber of the (indefinite)Kac-Moody ``overextension'' (or ``canonical Lorentzian extension'') of thefinite-dimensional Lie algebra that appears in the toroidal compactification to3 spacetime dimensions. A remarkable feature of the billiard properties,however, is that they do not depend on the spacetime dimension in which thetheory is analyzed and hence are rather robust, while the symmetry algebra thatemerges in the toroidal dimensional reduction is dimension-dependent.
