A system of coupled scalar fields is introduced which possesses a spectrum ofmassive single-soliton solutions. Some of these solutions are unstable anddecay into lower mass stable solitons. Some properties of the solutions areobtained using general principles including conservations of energy andtopological charges. Rest energies are calculated via a variational scheme, andthe dynamics of the coupled fields are obtained by solving the field equationsnumerically.
