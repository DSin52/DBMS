We present new rolling tachyon solutions describing the classical decay ofD-branes. Our methods are simpler than those appearing in recent works, yet ourresults are exact in classical string theory. The role of pressure in the decayis studied using tachyon profiles with spatial variation. In this case thefinal state involves an array of codimension one D-branes rather than static,pressureless tachyon matter.
