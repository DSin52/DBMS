Title: Time evolution of rolling tachyons for a brane-antibrane pair

Authors: Haewon Lee, W. S. l'Yi

Comments: 10 pages, 2 figures. Addition of references in v2, inclusion of more

details in v3A precise form of the time evolution of rolling tachyons corresponding to abrane-antibrane pair is investigated by solving the Hamiltonian equations ofmotion under the assumption that in a region far away from branes the tachyonvacuum is almost already achieved, even at the beginning of the rolling.
