Some of the recent important developments in understanding string/ gaugedualities are based on the idea of highly symmetric motion of ``stringsolitons'' in $AdS_5\times S^5$ geometry originally suggested by Gubser,Klebanov and Polyakov. In this paper we study symmetric motion of short stringsin the presence of antisymetric closed string B field. We compare the values ofthe energy and the spin in the case of non-vanishing B field with thoseobtained in the case of B=0. The presence of NS-NS antisymmetric field couplesthe fluctuation modes that indicates changes in the quantum corrections to theenergy spectrum.
