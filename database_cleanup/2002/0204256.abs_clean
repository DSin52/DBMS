We study a noncommutative gauge theory on a fuzzy four-sphere. The idea is touse a matrix model with a fifth-rank Chern-Simons term and to expand matricesaround the fuzzy four-sphere which corresponds to a classical solution of thismodel. We need extra degrees of freedom since algebra of coordinates does notclose on the fuzzy four-sphere. In such a construction, a fuzzy two sphere isadded at each point on the fuzzy four-sphere as extra degrees of freedom. It isinteresting that fields on the fuzzy four-sphere have higher spins due to theextra degrees of freedom. We also consider a theory around the north pole andtake a flat space limit. A noncommutative gauge theory on four-dimensionalplane, which has Heisenberg type noncommutativity, is considered.
