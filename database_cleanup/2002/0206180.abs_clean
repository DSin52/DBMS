We show that gravitational Chern-Simons corrections, associated with thesigma-model anomaly on the M5-brane world-volume, can resolve the singularityof the M2-brane solution with Ricci-flat, special holonomy transverse space. Weexplicitly find smooth solutions in the cases when the transverse space is amanifold of Spin(7) holonomy and SU(4) holonomy. We comment on the consequencesof these results for the holographically related three-dimensional theoriesliving on the world volume of a stack of such resolved M2-branes.
