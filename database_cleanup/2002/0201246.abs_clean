The question of general covariance in quantum gravity is considered in thefirst post-Newtonian approximation. Transformation properties of observablequantities under deformations of a reference frame, induced by variations ofthe gauge conditions fixing general invariance, are determined. It is foundthat the one-loop contributions violate the principle of general covariance, inthe sense that the quantities which are classically invariant under suchdeformations take generally different values in different reference frames. Therelative value of this violation is of the order 1/N, where N is the number ofparticles in a gravitating body.
