for closed string vertices is amendedBrane-like vertex operators play an important role in a worldsheetformulation of D-branes and M-theory. In this paper we derive the DBI D-braneaction from NSR closed string sigma-model with brane-like states. We also showthat these operators carry RR charges and define D-brane wavefunctions in asecond quantized formalism.
