We study confinement in softly broken N=2 SUSY QCD with gauge group SU(N_c)and N_f hypermultiplets of fundamental matter (quarks) when the Coulomb branchis lifted by small mass of adjoint matter. Concentrating mostly on the theorywith SU(3) gauge group we discuss the N=1 vacua which arise in the weakcoupling at large values of quark masses and study flux tubes and monopoleconfinement in these vacua. In particular we find the BPS strings in SU(3)gauge theory formed by two interacting U(1) gauge fields and two scalar fieldsgeneralizing ordinary Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices. Then we focus on theSU(3) gauge theories with N_f=4 and N_f=5 flavors with equal masses. In thesetheories there are N=1 vacua with restored SU(2) gauge subgroup in quantumtheory since SU(2) subsectors are not asymptotically free. We show thatalthough the confinement in these theories is due to Abelian flux tubes themultiplicity of meson spectrum is the same as expected in a theory withnon-Abelian confinement.
