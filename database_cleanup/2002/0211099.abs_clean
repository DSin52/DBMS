Title: On the Representation of Intermediate States in the Velocity Basis

Authors: B. A. Tay, S. Wickramasekara

Comments: 17 pages, 2 figures

We explore the implication of applying the "minimally complex" representationto study intermediate states. We propose an interpretation of the "velocityvariables" used in the "minimally complex" representation so as to make theconstruction consistent with the kinematics of the underlying scatteringprocess under consideration. We also show that this choice of representationadvocates the use of velocity basis over momentum basis in studyingintermediate states.
