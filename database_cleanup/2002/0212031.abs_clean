Title: Duality between Noncommutative Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons and Non-Abelian

Self-Dual ModelsAuthors: M. Botta Cantcheff, Pablo Minces

Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX. v2 minor changes. v3 substantial additions, including

a new section discussing the Seiberg-Witten map. v4 references and commentsadded. Final version to be published in Phys. Lett. BBy introducing an appropriate parent action and considering a perturbativeapproach, we establish, up to fourth order terms in the field and for the fullrange of the coupling constant, the equivalence between the noncommutativeYang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory and the noncommutative, non-Abelian Self-Dualmodel. In doing this, we consider two different approaches by using both theMoyal star-product and the Seiberg-Witten map.
