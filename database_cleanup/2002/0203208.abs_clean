The motion of a scalar particle in (d+1)-dimensional AdS space may bedescribed in terms of the Cartesian coordinates that span the (d+2)-dimensionalspace in which the AdS space is embedded. Upon quantization, the masshyperboloid defined in terms of the conjugate momenta turns into the waveequation in AdS space. By interchanging the roles of coordinates and conjugatemomenta in the (d+2)-dimensional space we arrive at a dual description. Formassive modes, the dual description is equivalent to the conventionalformulation, as required by holography. For tachyonic modes, this interchangeof coordinates and momenta establishes a duality between Euclidean AdS and dSspaces. We discuss its implications on Green functions for the various vacua.
