The entropy of the states associated to the solutions of the equations ofmotion of the bosonic open string with combinations of Neumann and Dirichletboundary conditions is given. Also, the entropy of the string in the states $|A^i > = \alpha^{i}_{-1} |0>$ and $| \phi^a > = \alpha^{a}_{-1} |0>$ thatdescribe the massless fields on the world-volume of the Dp-brane is computed.
