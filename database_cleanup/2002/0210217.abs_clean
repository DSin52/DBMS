Title: Braneworld Cosmology and Holography

Authors: Antonio Padilla

Comments: PhD. Thesis. Supervisor

This thesis is devoted to studying two important aspects of braneworldequations induced on a general $(n-2)$-brane of arbitrary tension, embedded insome $n$-dimensional bulk. The brane energy-momentum tensor enters theseequations both linearly and quadratically. From the point of view of ahomogeneous and isotropic brane we see quadratic deviations from the FRWequations of the standard cosmology. There is also a contribution from a bulkWeyl tensor. We study this in detail when the bulk is AdS-Schwarzschild orReissner-Nordstr\"om AdS. This contribution can be understood holographically.For the AdS-Schwarzschild case, we show that the geometry on a brane near theAdS boundary is just that of a radiation dominated FRW universe. The radiationcomes from a field theory that is dual to the AdS bulk. We also develop a newapproach which allows us to consider branes that are not near the AdS boundary.This time the dual field theory contributes quadratic energy density/pressureterms to the FRW equations. Remarkably, these take exactly the same form as foradditional matter placed on the brane by hand, with no bulk Weyl tensor.We also derive the general equations of motion for a braneworld containing adomain wall. For the critical brane, the induced geometry is identical to thatof a vacuum domain wall in $(n-1)$-dimensional Einstein gravity. We develop thetools to construct a nested Randall-Sundrum scenario whereby we have a``critical'' domain wall living on an anti-de Sitter brane. We also show how toconstruct instantons on the brane, and calculate the probability of falsevacuum decay.
