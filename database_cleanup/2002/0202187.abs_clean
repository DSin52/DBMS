We explore bosonic strings and Type II superstrings in the simplest timedependent backgrounds, namely orbifolds of Minkowski space by time reversal andsome spatial reflections. We show that there are no negative norm physicalexcitations. However, the contributions of negative norm virtual states toquantum loops do not cancel, showing that a ghost-free gauge cannot be chosen.The spectrum includes a twisted sector, with strings confined to a ``conical''singularity which is localized in time. Since these localized strings are notvisible to asymptotic observers, interesting issues arise regarding unitarityof the S-matrix for scattering of propagating states. The partition function ofour model is modular invariant, and for the superstring, the zero momentumdilaton tadpole vanishes. Many of the issues we study will be generic totime-dependent cosmological backgrounds with singularities localized in time,and we derive some general lessons about quantizing strings on such spaces.
