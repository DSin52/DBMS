We investigate various supersymmetric brane intersections. Motivated by therecent results on supertubes, we investigate general constraints in whichparallel brane-antibrane configurations are supersymmetric. Dual descriptionsof these configurations involve systems of branes in relative motion. Inparticular, we find new supersymmetric configurations which are not related toa static brane intersection by a boost. In these new configurations, theintersection point moves at the speed of light. These systems provideinteresting time dependent backgrounds for open strings.
