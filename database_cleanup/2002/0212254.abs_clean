Title: An Improved Mean Field Approximation on the Worldsheet for Planar phi^3

TheoryAuthors: Korkut Bardakci and Charles B. Thorn

Comments: 32 pages, 3 figures

We present an improved version of our earlier work on summing the planargraphs in phi^3 field theory. The present treatment is also based on our worldsheet formalism and the mean field approximation, but it makes use of nofurther approximations. We derive a set of equations between the expectationvalues of the world sheet fields, and we investigate them in certain limits. Weshow that the equations can give rise to (metastable) string forming solutions.
