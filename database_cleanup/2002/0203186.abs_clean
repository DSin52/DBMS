The open string ending on a D-brane with a constant B-field in a pp-waveRamond-Ramond background is exactly solvable. The theory is controlled by threelightcone momentum) and the B-field. We quantize the open string theory anddetermine the full noncommutative structure. In particular, we find a fullynoncommutative phase space whose noncommutativity depends on all theseparameters. The lightcone Hamiltionian is obtained, and as a consequence of thenontrivial commutation relations of the theory, new features of the spectrumare noted. Various scaling limits of the string results are considered.Physical implications are discussed.
