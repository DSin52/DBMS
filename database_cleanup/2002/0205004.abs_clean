We show that, for both scalar and spinor QED, the two-loop Euler-Heisenbergeffective Lagrangian for a constant Euclidean self-dual background has anextremely simple closed-form expression in terms of the digamma function.Moreover, the scalar and spinor QED effective Lagrangians are very similar toone another. These results are dramatic simplifications compared to the resultsfor other backgrounds. We apply them to a calculation of the low energy limitsof the two-loop massive N-photon `all +' helicity amplitudes. The simplicity ofour results can be related to the connection between self-duality, helicity andsupersymmetry.
