Title: Geometrical approach to loop calculations and the epsilon-expansion of

Feynman diagramsAuthors: A.I. Davydychev, M.Yu. Kalmykov

Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX, contribution to the Proceedings of CPP2001 (Tokyo,

Japan, November 2001)Some problems related to the structure of higher terms of theepsilon-expansion of Feynman diagrams are discussed.
