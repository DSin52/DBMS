We analyse open string correlators in non-constant background fields,including the metric $g$, the antisymmetric $B$-field, and the gauge field $A$.Working with a derivative expansion for the background fields, but exact intheir constant parts, we obtain a tachyonic on-shell condition for the insertedfunctions and extract the kinetic term for the tachyon action. The 3-pointcorrelator yields a non-commutative tachyon potential. We also find aboundary metric $G$ plays an essential role in the action, the naturalconnection on the D-brane is the same as in closed string theory, i.e. it iscompatible with the bulk metric and has torsion $H=dB$. This means, inparticular, that the parallel transport on the brane is independent of thegauge field $A$.
