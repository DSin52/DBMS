SystemsThe exact solution of the noncompact SL(2,C) Heisenberg spin magnet reveals ahidden symmetry of the energy spectrum. To understand its origin, we solve thespectral problem for the model within quasiclassical approach. In thisapproach, the integrals of motion satisfy the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantizationconditions imposed on the orbits of classical motion. In the representation ofthe separated coordinates, the latter wrap around a Riemann surface defined bythe spectral curve of the model. A novel feature of the obtained quantizationconditions is that they involve both the alpha- and beta-periods of the actiondifferential on the Riemann surface, thus allowing us to find their solutionsby exploring the full modular group of the spectral curve. We demonstrate thatthe quasiclassical energy spectrum is in a good agreement with the exactresults.
