We use the correspondence between scalar field theory on AdS and inducedconformal field theory on its boundary to calculate correlation functions oflogarithmic conformal field theory in arbitrary dimensions.Our calculationsutilize the newly proposed method of nilpotent weights.We derive expressionsfor the four point function assuming a generic interaction term
