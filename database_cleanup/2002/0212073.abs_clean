I agree with the authors of hep-th/0211149 that the claim made in Phys.Lett.B542, 282 (2002) is incorrect and that the derivation of its main formula,although correct, contains two compensating errors. In this reply the mainformula of Phys.Lett. B542, 282 (2002) is rederived. This new derivation showsthat not only the energy momentum cut off regularization method still works inthe calculation of the soliton quantum mass corrections, but also that the socalled mode number regularization emerges naturally from it.
