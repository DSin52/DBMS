We consider non-planar contributions to the correlation functions of BMNoperators in free N = 4 super Yang Mills theory. We recalculate thesenon-planar contributions from a different kind of diagram and find some exactagreements. The vertices of these diagrams are represented by free planar threepoint functions, thus our calculations provide some interesting identities forcorrelation functions of BMN operators in N = 4 super Yang Mills theory. Thesediagrams look very much like loop diagrams in a second quantized string fieldtheory, thus these identities could possibly be interpreted as naturalconsequences of the pp-wave/CFT correspondence.
