In an attempt to bridge the gap between M-theory and braneworldphenomenology, we present various gravitational Lorentz-violating braneworldswhich arise from p-brane systems. Lorentz invariance is still preserved locallyon the braneworld. For certain p-brane intersections, the massless graviton isquasi-localized. This also results from an M5-brane in a C-field. In the caseof a p-brane perturbed from extremality, the quasi-localized graviton ismassive. For a braneworld arising from global AdS_5, gravitons travel fasterwhen further in the bulk, thereby apparently traversing distances faster thanlight.
