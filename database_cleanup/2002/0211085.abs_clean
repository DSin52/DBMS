Title: Non-renormalization theorems from extension to local coupling

Authors: Elisabeth Kraus

Comments: Talk presented at the 10th International Conference on Supersymmetry

and Unification of Fundamental Interactions (SUSY 02), DESY, Hamburg, GermanyThe extension of coupling constants to space-time dependent fields, the localcouplings, makes possible to derive the non-renormalization theorems ofsupersymmetry by an algebraic characterization of Lagrangian N=1supermultiplets. For super-Yang-Mills theories the construction impliesnon-renormalization of the coupling beyond one-loop order. However,renormalization in presence of the local gauge coupling is peculiar due to anew anomaly in one-loop order, which appears as an anomaly of supersymmetry inthe Wess-Zumino gauge. As an application we derive the closed all-orderexpression for the gauge $\beta$ function and prove the non-renormalization ofgeneral N=2 supersymmetric theories from a cancellation of the susy anomaly.
