Title: Liouville Field Theory on a Unoriented Surface

Authors: Yasuaki Hikida

Comments: 13 pages, no figures, LaTeX

Liouville field theory on a unoriented surface is investigated, inparticular, the one point function on a RP^2 is calculated. The constraint ofthe one point function is obtained by using the crossing symmetry of the twopoint function. There are many solutions of the constraint and we can chooseone of them by considering the modular bootstrap.
