Spacelike branes are new time-dependent systems to explore and it has beenobserved that related supergravity solutions can be obtained by analyticallycontinuing known D-brane solutions. Here we show that analytic continuation ofknown solutions of the Dirac-Born-Infeld equations also lead to interestinganalogs of time dependent gravity solutions. Properties of these new solutions,which are similar to the Witten bubble of nothing and S-branes, are discussed.We comment on how these new bubble solutions seem relevant to the tachyoncondensation process of non-BPS branes, and remark on their application tocosmological scenarios. Unstable brane configurations which resemble S-branetype solutions are also discussed.
