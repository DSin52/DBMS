We consider a Penrose limit of AdS_4 x Q^{1,1,1} that provides the pp-wavegeometry equal to the one in the Penrose limit of AdS_4 x S^7. We expect thatthere exists a subsector of three dimensional N=2 dual gauge theory which hasenhanced N=8 maximal supersymmetry. We identify operators in the N=2 gaugetheory with 11-dimensional supergravity KK excitations in the pp-wave geometryand describe how both the chiral multiplets and semi-conserved multiplets fallinto N=8 supermultiplets.
