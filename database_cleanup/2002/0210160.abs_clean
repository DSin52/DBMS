The idea that asymptotic de Sitter space can be described by a finite HilbertSpace implies that any quantum measurement has an irreducible innacuracy. Weargue that this prevents any measurement from verifying the existence of thePoincare recurrences that occur in the mathematical formulation of quantum deSitter (dS) space. It also implies that the mathematical quantum theory of dSspace is not unique. There will be many different Hamiltonians, which give thesame results, within the uncertainty in all possible measurements.
