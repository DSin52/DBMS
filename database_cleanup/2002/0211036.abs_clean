We study the dual equivalence between the nonlinear generalization of theself-dual ($NSD_{B\wedge F}$) and the topologically massive $B\wedge F$ modelswith particular emphasis on the nonlinear electrodynamics proposed by Born andInfeld. This is done through a dynamical gauge embedding of the nonlinearself-dual model yielding to a gauge invariant and dynamically equivalenttheory. We clearly show that nonpolinomial $NSD_{B\wedge F}$ models can bemapped, through a properly defined duality transformation, into $TM_{B\wedgeF}$ actions. The general result obtained is then particularized for a number ofexamples, including the Born-Infeld-BF (BIBF) model that has experienced arevival in the recent literature.
