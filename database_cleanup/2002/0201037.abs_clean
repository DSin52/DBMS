We present orientifold models of type IIA string theory with D8-branescompactified on a two torus times a four dimensional orbifold. The orientifoldgroup is chosen such that one coordinate of the two torus is reversed whenapplying worldsheet parity. RR tadpole cancellation requires D8-branes whichwrap 1-cycles on the two torus and transform non-trivially under the orbifoldgroup. These models are T-dual to orientifolds with D4-branes only which admitlarge volume compactifications. The intersections of the D8-branes are chosenin such a way that supersymmetry is broken in the open string sector and chiralfermions arise. Stability of the models is discussed in the context of NSNStadpoles. Two examples with the SM gauge group and two left-right symmetricmodels are given.
