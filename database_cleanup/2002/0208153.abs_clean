We study a bound state of fractional D3-branes localized inside theworld-volume of fractional D7-branes on the orbifold C^3/Z_2 x Z_2. Wedetermine the open string spectrum that leads to N=1 U(N1)xU(N2)xU(N3)xU(N4)gauge theory with matter having the number of D7-branes as a flavor index. Wederive the linearized boundary action of the D7-brane on this orbifold usingthe boundary state formalism and we discuss the tadpole cancellation. Aftercomputing the asymptotic expression of the supergravity solution the anomaliesof the gauge theory are reproduced.
