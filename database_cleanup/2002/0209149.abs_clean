In three-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell gravity the electrostaticBanados-Teitelboim-Zanelli solution and the magnetostatic Hirschmann-Welchsolution are connected by a duality mapping. Here we point out that a similarduality mapping exists among circularly symmetric electrostatic andmagnetostatic spacetimes, and electric and magnetic stationary solutions, for anonlinear electrodynamics coupled to three-dimensional Einstein gravity.
