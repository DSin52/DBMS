Title: On dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in quantum electrodynamics

Comments: 11 pages, Plain LaTex, no figures

The problem of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) in multidimensionalquantum electrodynamics (QED) is considered. It is shown that forsix-dimensional QED the phenomenon of DSCB exists in ladder model for anycoupling.
