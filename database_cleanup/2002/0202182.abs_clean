Title: Chiral zero-mode for abelian BPS dipoles

Authors: Pierre van Baal

Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure (in 2 parts), presented at the workshop on

"Confinement, Topology, and other Non-Perturbative Aspects of QCD", 21-27Jan. 2002, Stara Lesna, SlovakiaWe present an exact normalisable zero-energy chiral fermion solution forabelian BPS dipoles. For a single dipole, this solution is contained within thehigh temperature limit of the SU(2) caloron with non-trivial holonomy.
