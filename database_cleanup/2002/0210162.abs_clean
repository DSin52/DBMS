Title: To see a world in a grain of sand

Authors: Shou-Cheng Zhang

Comments: A chapter for John Wheeler's 90's birthday festschrift

Throughout John Wheeler's career, he wrestled with big issues like thefundamental length, the black hole and the unification of quantum mechanics andrelativity. In this essay, I argue that solid state physics -- historically thestudy of silicon, semiconductors and sand grains -- can give surprisingly deepinsights into the big questions of the world.
