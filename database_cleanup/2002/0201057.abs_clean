It is argued that the derivative expansion is a suitable method to deal withfinite temperature field theory, if it is restricted to spatial derivativesonly. Using this method, a simple and direct calculation is presented for theradiatively induced Chern-Simons--like piece of the effective action of(2+1)-dimensional fermions at finite temperature coupled to external gaugefields. The gauge fields are not assumed to be subjected to specialconstraints, and in particular, they are not required to be stationary norAbelian.
