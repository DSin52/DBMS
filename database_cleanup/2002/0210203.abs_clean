references added, style improvedThe possibility of noncommutative topological gravity arising in the samemanner as Yang-Mills theory is explored. We use the Seiberg-Witten map toconstruct such a theory based on a SL(2,C) complex connection, from which theEuler characteristic and the signature invariant are obtained. This gives us away towards the description of noncommutative gravitational instantons as wellas noncommutative local gravitational anomalies.
