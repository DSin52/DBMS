We give a detailed study of the associativity anomaly in open string fieldtheory from the viewpoint of the split string and Moyal formalisms. The originof the anomaly is reduced to the properties of the special infinite sizematrices which relate the conventional open string to the split stringvariables, and is intimately related to midpoint issues. We discuss two stepsto cope with the anomaly. We identify the field subspace that causes theanomaly which is related to the existence of closed string configurations, andindicate a decomposition of open/closed string sectors. We then propose aconsistent cut off method with a finite number of string modes that guaranteesassociativity at every step of any computation.
