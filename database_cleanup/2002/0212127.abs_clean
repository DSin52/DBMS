We define a 3-generator algebra obtained by replacing the commutators byanticommutators in the defining relations of the angular momentum algebra. Weshow that integer spin representations are in one to one correspondence withthose of the angular momentum algebra. The half-integer spin representations,on the other hand, split into two representations of dimension j + 1/2. Theanticommutator spin algebra is invariant under the action of the quantum groupSO_q(3) with q=-1.
