Supergravity extensions of generic 2d gravity theories obtained from thegraded Poisson-Sigma model (gPSM) approach show a large degree of ambiguity. Onthe other hand, obstructions may reduce the allowed range of fields as given bythe bosonic theory, or even prohibit any extension in certain cases. In ourpresent work we relate the finite W-algebras inherent in the gPSM algebra ofconstraints to supergravity algebras (Neuveu-Schwarz or Ramond algebras resp.),deformed by the presence of the dilaton field. With very straightforward andnatural assumptions on them --like the one linking the anti-commutator ofcertain fermionic charges to the Hamiltonian constraint without deformation--we are able not only to remove the ambiguities but, at the same time, thesingularities referred to above. Thus all especially interesting bosonic models(spherically reduced gravity, the Jackiw-Teitelboim model etc.) under theseconditions possess a unique fermionic extension and are free from newsingularities. The superspace supergravity model of Howe is found as a specialcase of this supergravity action. For this class of models the relation betweenbosonic potential and prepotential does not introduce obstructions as well.
