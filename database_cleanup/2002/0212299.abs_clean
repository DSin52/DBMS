two references addedToric Duality arises as an ambiguity in computing the quiver gauge theoryliving on a D3-brane which probes a toric singularity. It is reviewed how, insimple cases Toric Duality is Seiberg Duality. The set of all Seiberg Dualitieson a single node in the quiver forms a group which is contained in a largergroup given by a set of Picard-Lefschetz transformations. This leads toelements in the group (sometimes called fractional Seiberg Duals) which are notSeiberg Duality on a single node, thus providing a new set of gauge theorieswhich flow to the same universality class in the Infra Red.
