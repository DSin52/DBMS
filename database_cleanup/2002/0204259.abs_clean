We show that, at one loop, the magnetic mass vanishes at finite temperaturein QED in any dimension. In QED$_{3}$, even the zero temperature part can beregularized to zero. We calculate the two loop contributions to the magneticmass in QED$_{3}$ with a Chern-Simons term and show that it vanishes. We give asimple proof which shows that the magnetic mass vanishes to all orders atfinite temperature in this theory. This proof also holds for QED in anydimension.
