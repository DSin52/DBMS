We explicitly find the spectrum of the operators $M^{rs}$ and$\widetilde{M}^{rs}$, which specify the star-product in the matter and ghostsectors correspondingly. Further we derive the diagonal representation for the3-string vertices. Using this representation we identify the appearing Moyalstructures in the matter sector. In addition to the continuousnon-commutativity parameter $\theta(\kappa)$ found in hep-th/0202087 we findthe discrete non-commutativity parametrized by $\theta_{\xi}$.
