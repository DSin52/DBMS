We compute the spinorial cohomology of ten-dimensional abelian SYM at orderalpha'^3 and we find that it is trivial. Consequently, linear supersymmetryalone excludes the presence of alpha'^3-order corrections. Our result lendssupport to the conjecture that there may be a unique supersymmetric deformationof ordinary ten-dimensional abelian SYM.
