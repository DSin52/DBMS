We compute the complete bulk one-loop contribution to the Weyl anomaly of theboundary theory for IIB Supergravity compactified on $ AdS_5\times S^5$. Theresult, that $\delta {\cal A}=(E+I)/(2\pi^2)$, reproduces the subleading termin the exact expression ${\cal A}=-(N^2-1)(E+I)/(2\pi^2)$ for the Weyl anomalyof ${\cal N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory, confirming the Maldacena conjecture.The anomaly receives contributions from all multiplets casting doubt on thepossibility of describing the boundary theory beyond leading order in $N$ by aconsistent truncation to the `massless' multiplet of IIB Supergravity.
