Title: Could Only Fermions Be Elementary?

In standard Poincare and anti de Sitter SO(2,3) invariant theories, theexistence of antiparticles is explained by using the fact that covariantequations have solutions with negative energies while a particle and itsantiparticle are described by independent positive energy unitary irreduciblerepresentations (UIRs) of the symmetry group. Such an approach cannot beapplied in de Sitter SO(1,4) invariant theory. As argued in our previouspapers, it would be more natural to require that i) one UIR should describe aparticle and its antiparticle simultaneously. This would automatically explainthe existence of antiparticles and show that a particle and its antiparticleare different states of the same object. If i) is adopted then, with such amodification of the standard approach, among the above groups only the SO(1,4)one is a candidate for constructing elementary particle theory. It is shownthat UIRs of the SO(1,4) group can be interpreted in the framework of i) andcannot be interpreted in the standard way. By quantizing such UIRs andrequiring that the energy should be positive in the Poincare limit, we concludethat only fermions can be elementary particles.
