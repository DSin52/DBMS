We prove a uniqueness theorem for asymptotically flat static charged dilatonblack hole solutions in higher dimensional space-times. We also constructinfinitely many non-asymptotically flat regular static black holes on the samespace-time manifold with the same spherical topology. An application to theuniqueness of a certain class of flat $p$-branes is also given.
