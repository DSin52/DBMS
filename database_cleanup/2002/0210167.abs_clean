Using the algebraic geometric approach of Berenstein et {\it al}(hep-th/005087 and hep-th/009209) and methods of toric geometry, we study noncommutative (NC) orbifolds of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties withdiscrete torsion. We first develop a new way of getting complex $d$ mirrorCalabi-Yau hypersurfaces $H_{\Delta}^{\ast d}$ in toric manifolds $M_{\Delta}^{\ast (d+1)}$ with a $C^{\ast r}$ action and analyze the general group of thediscrete isometries of $H_{\Delta}^{\ast d}$. Then we build a general class of$d$ complex dimension NC mirror Calabi-Yau orbifolds where the noncommutativity parameters $\theta_{\mu \nu}$ are solved in terms of discretetorsion and toric geometry data of $M_{\Delta}^{(d+1)}$ in which the originalCalabi-Yau hypersurfaces is embedded. Next we work out a generalization of theNC algebra for generic $d$ dimensions NC Calabi-Yau manifolds and give variousrepresentations depending on different choices of the Calabi-Yau toric geometrydata. We also study fractional D-branes at orbifold points. We refine andextend the result for NC $% (T^{2}\times T^{2}\timesT^{2})/(\mathbf{{Z_{2}}\times {Z_{2})}}$ to higher dimensional torii orbifoldsin terms of Clifford algebra.
