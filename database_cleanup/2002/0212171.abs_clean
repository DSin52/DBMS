The lowest (``vector'') and next-lowest (``scalar'') bound-state masses ofthe massive Schwinger model have been determined recently to a very highaccuracy numerically on the lattice. Therefore, improved results for thesebound-state masses from analytical calculations are of some interest. Here, weprovide such improved results by employing both standard and renormal-ordered(fermion) mass perturbation theory, as well as a consistency condition betweenthe two perturbative calculations. The resulting bound-state masses are inexcellent agreement with the lattice results for small and intermediate fermionmass, and remain within 10% of the exact results even in the limit of verylarge fermion mass.
