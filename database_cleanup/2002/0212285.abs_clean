We start from a parity-breaking MCS QED$_{3}$ model with spontaneous breakingof the gauge symmetry as a framework for evaluation of the electron-electroninteraction potential and for attainment of numerical values for the e-e boundstate. Three expressions are obtained for the potential according to thepolarization state of the scattered electrons. In an energy scale compatiblewith Condensed Matter electronic excitations, these three potentials becomedegenerated. The resulting potential is implemented in the Schrodinger equationand the variational method is applied to carry out the electronic bindingenergy. The resulting binding energies in the scale of 10-100 meV and acorrelation length in the scale of 10-30 Angs. are possible indications thatthe MCS-QED$_{3}$ model adopted may be suitable to address an eventual case ofe-e pairing in the presence of parity-symmetry breakdown. The data analyzedhere suggest an energy scale of 10-100 meV to fix the breaking of theU(1)-symmetry.
