Title: Spacetime Dependent Lagrangians and the Barriola-Vilenkin Monopole Mass

Authors: Debashis Gangopadhyay, Rajsekhar Bhattacharyya, L.P. Singh

Comments: 13 pages, Latex, Dadhich definition of empty space implemented, basic

results unchanged except for minor numerical factors, typoscorrected,references addedWe apply the spacetime dependent lagrangian formalism [1] to the action ingeneral relativity. We obtain Barriola-Vilenkin [B-V] [2] type of topologicalsolution by exploiting the electro-gravity duality [4] of the vacuum Einsteinequations and using Dadhich's definition of empty space. The monopole mass M isshown to be of order a/G with a/G < M < 2a/G, a a small positive constant and GNewton's gravitational constant. The lower of these bounds can be written as M>= (a/G)beta, where 1< beta(=2k) < 2, 2k is the global monopole charge. Thisreminds us of the Bogomolny bound for usual monopoles. Comparing with theBarriola-Vilenkin scenario of a spontaneously broken scalar field theory, thiscan also provide an experimental check on the Grand Unification Scale11.27.+d, 14.80.Hv, 04.
