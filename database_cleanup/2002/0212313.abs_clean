SolitonsAuthors: Eric D'Hoker, I.M. Krichever and D.H. Phong

Comments: 47 pages, no figures, Beijing and Hangzhou 2002

This is an expanded version of lectures given in Hangzhou and Beijing, on thesymplectic forms common to Seiberg-Witten theory and the theory of solitons.Methods for evaluating the prepotential are discussed. The construction of newintegrable models arising from supersymmetric gauge theories are reviewed,including twisted Calogero-Moser systems and spin chain models with twistedmonodromy conditions. A practical framework is presented for evaluating theuniversal symplectic form in terms of Lax pairs. A subtle distinction between aLie algebra and a Lie group version of this symplectic form is clarified, whichis necessary in chain models.
