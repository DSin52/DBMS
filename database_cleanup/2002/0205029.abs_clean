Finite temperature boson and fermion field theories on ultrastaticspace-times with a d-sphere spatial section are discussed with one eye on thequestions of temperature inversion symmetry and modular invariance. Forconformally invariant theories it is shown that the total energy at anytemperature for any dimension, d, is given as a power series in the d=3 and d=5energies, for scalars, and the d=1 and d=3 energies for spinors. Further, theseenergies can be given in finite terms at specific temperatures associated withsingular moduli of elliptic function theory. Some examples are listed andnumbers given.
