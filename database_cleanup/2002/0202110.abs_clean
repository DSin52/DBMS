Patterns in Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Stony Brook, June 2001,final version, to appear in the ProceedingsWe review the combinatorial structure of perturbative quantum field theorywith emphasis given to the decomposition of graphs into primitive ones. Theconsequences in terms of unique factorization of Dyson--Schwinger equationsinto Euler products are discussed.
