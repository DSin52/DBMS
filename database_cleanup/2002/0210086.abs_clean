(VFC workshop) Corrections added to match final versionWe report results on the construction of cosmological braneworld models inthe context of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, which include the leadingcorrection to the Einstein-Hilbert action suggested by superstring theory. Weobtain and study the equations governing the dynamics of the standardcosmological models. We find that they can be written in the same form as inthe case of the Randall-Sundrum model but with time-varying four-dimensionalgravitational and cosmological constants. Finally, we discuss the cosmologicalevolution predicted by these models and their compatibility with observationaldata.
