Title: Asymptotic Interactions of Critically Coupled Vortices

Authors: N.S. Manton and J.M. Speight

Comments: 23 pages, 1 figure; some references and a discussion of asymptotic

curvature properties addedAt critical coupling, the interactions of Ginzburg-Landau vortices aredetermined by the metric on the moduli space of static solutions. Theasymptotic form of the metric for two well separated vortices is shown here tobe expressible in terms of a Bessel function. A straightforward extension givesthe metric for N vortices. The asymptotic metric is also shown to follow from aphysical model, where each vortex is treated as a point-like particle carryinga scalar charge and a magnetic dipole moment of the same magnitude. Thegeodesic motion of two well separated vortices is investigated, and theasymptotic dependence of the scattering angle on the impact parameter isdetermined. Formulae for the asymptotic Ricci and scalar curvatures of theN-vortex moduli space are also obtained.
