The non-perturbative superpotential generated by a heterotic superstringwrapped once around a genus-zero holomorphic curve is proportional to thePfaffian involving the determinant of a Dirac operator on this curve. We showthat the space of zero modes of this Dirac operator is the kernel of a linearmapping that is dependent on the associated vector bundle moduli. By explicitlycomputing the determinant of this map, one can deduce whether or not thedimension of the space of zero modes vanishes. It is shown that thisinformation is sufficient to completely determine the Pfaffian and, hence, thenon-perturbative superpotential as explicit holomorphic functions of the vectorbundle moduli. This method is illustrated by a number of non-trivial examples.
