Title: Operator Regularization and Large Noncommutative Chern Simons Theory

Ontario)We examine noncommutative Chern Simons theory using operator regularization.Both the zeta-function and the eta-function are needed to determine one loopeffects. The contributions to these functions coming from the two pointfunction is evaluated. The U(N) noncommutative model smoothly reduces to theSU(N) commutative model as the noncommutative parameter theta_{mu nu} vanishes.
