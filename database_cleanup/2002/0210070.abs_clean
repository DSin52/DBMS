We analyse the SU(2)_k WZNW models beyond the integrable representations andin particular the case of SU(2)_0. We find that these are good examples oflogarithmic conformal field theories as indecomposable representations arenaturally produced in the fusion of discrete irreducible representations. Wealso find extra, chiral and non-chiral, multiplet structure in the theory. Thechiral fields, which we construct explicitly in SU(2)_0, generate extendedalgebras within the model. We also study the process of quantum hamiltonianreduction of SU(2)_0, giving the c=-2 triplet model, in both the free fieldapproach and at the level of correlation functions. For rational level SU(2)_kthis gives us a useful technique to study the h_{1,s} correlators of thec_{p,q} models and we find very similar structures to SU(2)_0. We also discussLCFT as a limit of a sequence of ordinary CFTs and some of the subtleties thatcan occur.
