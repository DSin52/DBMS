In this paper we propose a superfield description for all Bianchi-typecosmological models. The action is invariant under world-line local $n=4$supersymmetry with $SU(2)_{local}XSU(2)_{global}$ internal symmetry. Due to theinvariance of the action we obtain the constraints, which form a closedsuperalgebra of the $n=4$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This procedureprovides the inclusion of supermatter in a sistematic way.
