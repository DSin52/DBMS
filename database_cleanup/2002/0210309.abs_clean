We describe various aspects of plane wave backgrounds. In particular, we makeexplicit a simple criterion for singularity by establishing a relation betweenBrinkmann metric entries and diffeomorphism-invariant curvature information. Wealso address the stability of plane wave backgrounds by analyzing thefluctuations of generic scalar modes. We focus our attention on cases whereafter fixing the light-cone gauge the resulting world sheet fields appear tohave negative "mass terms". We nevertheless argue that these backgrounds may bestable.
