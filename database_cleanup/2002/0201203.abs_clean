The second virial coefficient $B_{2}^{nc}(T)$ for non-interacting particlesmoving in a two-dimensional noncommutative space and in the presence of auniform magnetic field $\vec B$ is presented. The noncommutativity parameter$\te$ can be chosen such that the $B_{2}^{nc}(T)$ can be interpreted as thesecond virial coefficient for anyons of statistics $\al$ in the presence of$\vec B$ and living on the commuting plane. In particular in the hightemperature limit $\be\lga 0$, we establish a relation between the parameter$\te$ and the statistics $\al$. Moreover, $B_{2}^{nc}(T)$ can also beinterpreted in terms of composite fermions.
