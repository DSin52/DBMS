We construct an exact metric which at short distances is the metric ofmassless particles in 5+1 spacetime (moving along a diameter of the sphere) andis AdS_3\times S^3 at infinity. We also consider a set of a conical defectspacetimes which are locally AdS_3\times S^3 and have the masses and charges ofa special set of chiral primaries of the dual orbifold CFT. We find thatexcitation energies for a scalar field in the latter geometries agree exactlyredshift in the geometry reproduces `long circle' physics in the CFT. Wepropose a map of string states in AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4 to states in theorbifold CFT, analogous to the recently discovered map for AdS_5\times S^5. Thevibrations of the string can be pictured as oscillations of a Fermi sea in theCFT.
