We show how to compute terms in an expansion of the world-volumesuperpotential for fairly general D-branes on the quintic Calabi-Yau usinglinear sigma model techniques, and show in examples that this superpotentialcaptures the geometry and obstruction theory of bundles and sheaves on thisCalabi-Yau.
