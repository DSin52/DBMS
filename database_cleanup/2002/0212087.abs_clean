We analyze the structure of supersymmetric Godel-like cosmological solutionsof string theory. Just as the original four-dimensional Godel universe, thesesolutions represent rotating, topologically trivial cosmologies with ahomogeneous metric and closed timelike curves. First we focus on"phenomenological" aspects of holography, and identify the preferredholographic screens associated with inertial comoving observers in GodelThe closed timelike curves are either hidden behind the holographic screen, orbroken by it into causal pieces. In fact, holography in Godel universes hasmany features in common with de Sitter space, suggesting that Godel universescould represent a supersymmetric laboratory for addressing the conceptualpuzzles of de Sitter holography. Then we initiate the investigation of"microscopic" aspects of holography of Godel universes in string theory. Weshow that Godel universes are T-dual to pp-waves, and use this fact to generatenew Godel-like solutions of string and M-theory by T-dualizing knownsupersymmetric pp-wave solutions.
