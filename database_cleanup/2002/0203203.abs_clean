Starting from the Maldacena-Nunez supergravity dual of N=1 super Yang-Millstheory we study the inclusion of a supersymmetry breaking gaugino mass term. Weconsider a class of non supersymmetric deformations of the MN solutions whichhave been recently proposed in the literature. We show that they can beinterpreted as corresponding to the inclusion of both a mass and a condensate.We calculate the vacuum energy of the supergravity solutions showing that theN-fold vacuum degeneracy of the N=1 theory is lifted by the inclusion of a massterm.
