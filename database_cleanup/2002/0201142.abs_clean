We establish that the Yang-Baxter equations in the presence of an impuritycan in general only admit solutions of simultaneous tranmission and reflectionwhen the transmission and reflection amplitudes commute in the defect degreesof freedom with an additional exchange of the corresponding rapidities. In theabsence of defect degrees of freedom we show in complete generality, that theonly exceptions to this are theories which possess rapidity independent bulkscattering matrices. In particular bulk theories with diagonal scatteringmatrices, can only be the free Boson and Fermion, the Federbush model and theirgeneralizations. These anyonic solutions do not admit the possibility ofexcited impurity states.
