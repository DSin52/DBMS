We investigate a class of matrix model which describes the dynamics ofidentical particles in even dimentional space. We show that the degrees offreedom after some constraints are implimented is proportional to particlenumber and consist of those for positions and internal degrees. The particledynamics is given by the metric on the smooth moduli space. The moduli spacemetric for two particles is found. The size of tightly packed $N$ particlesgrows like $\sqrt{N}$. Our matrix model is related to the matrix model forfractional quantum Hall effect, the ADHM formalism of U(1) instantons onnoncommutative space, and supersymmetric D0 branes on D6 branes with nonzeroB-field in type IIA theory.
