the paper will be published in IJPAIt is shown that a suitably formulated algebraic lightfront holography, inwhich the lightfront is viewed as the linear extension of the upper causalhorizon of a wedge region, is capable of overcoming the shortcomings of the oldlightfront quantization. The absence of transverse vacuum fluctuations whichthis formalism reveals, is responsible for an area (edge of the wedge)density of entropy for a ``split localization''. This area proportionality ofhorizon associated entropy has to be compared to the volume dependence ofordinary heat bath entropy. The desired limit, in which the split distancevanishes and the localization on the horizon becomes sharp, can at most yield arelative area density which measures the ratio of area densities for differentquantum matter. In order to obtain a normalized area density one needs theunknown analog of a second fundamental law of thermodynamics for thermalizationcaused by vacuum fluctuation through localization on causal horizons. This issimilar to the role of the classical Gibbs form of that law which relatesBekenstein's classical area formula with the Hawking quantum mechanism for
