The quantum gravity is formulated based on gauge principle. The modeldiscussed in this paper has local gravitational gauge symmetry andgravitational field is represented by gauge potential. A preliminary study ongravitational gauge group is presented. Path integral quantization of thetheory is discussed in the paper. A strict proof on the renormalizability ofthe theory is also given. In leading order approximation, the gravitationalgauge field theory gives out classical Newton's theory of gravity. It can alsogive out an Einstein-like field equation with cosmological term. The predictionfor cosmological constant given by this model is well consistent withexperimental results. For classical tests, it gives out the same theoreticalpredictions as those of general relativity. Combining cosmological principlewith the field equation of gravitational gauge field, we can also set up acosmological model which is consistent with recent observations.
