Title: Born-Infeld Action from Supergravity

Authors: Matsuo Sato and Asato Tsuchiya

Comments: 25 pages, U(1) gauge field strength is included in the solution,

section 6 is changed, more references addedWe show that the Born-Infeld action with the Wess-Zumino terms for theRamond-Ramond fields, which is the D3-brane effective action, is a solution tothe Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equation in type IIB supergravity. Adopting theradial coordinate as time, we develop the ADM formalism for type IIBsupergravity reduced on $S^5$ and derive the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which isthe classical limit of the Wheeler-De Witt equation and whose solutions areclassical on-shell actions. The solution to the H-J equation reproduces theon-shell actions for the supergravity solution of a stack of D3-branes in $B_2$field and its near-horizon limit, which is conjectured to be dual tononcommutative Yang Mills and reduces to $AdS_5 \times S^5$ in the commutativelimit. Our D3-brane effective action is that of a probe D3-brane, and theradial time corresponds to the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field inthe dual Yang Mills. Our findings can be applied to a study of the holographicrenormalization group.
