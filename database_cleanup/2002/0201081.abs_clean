We show that the maximally supersymmetric pp-waves of IIB superstring andM-theories can be obtained as a Penrose limit of the supersymmetric AdS x Ssolutions. In addition we find that in a certain large tension limit, thegeometry seen by a brane probe in an AdS x S background is either Minkowskispace or a maximally supersymmetric pp-wave.
