We deform two-dimensional topological gravity by making use of its gaugetheory formulation. The obtained noncommutative gravity model is shown to beinvariant under a class of transformations that reduce to standarddiffeomorphisms once the noncommutativity parameter is set to zero. Somesolutions of the deformed model, like fuzzy AdS_2, are obtained. Furthermore,the transformation properties of the model under the Seiberg-Witten map arestudied.
