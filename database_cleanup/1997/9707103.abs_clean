Generalized quantum mechanics is used to examine a simple two-particlescattering experiment in which there is a bounded region of closed timelikecurves (CTCs) in the experiment's future. The transitional probability is shownto depend on the existence and distribution of the CTCs. The effect istherefore acausal, since the CTCs are in the experiment's causal future. Theeffect is due to the non-unitary evolution of the pre- and post-scatteringparticles as they pass through the region of CTCs. We use the time-machinespacetime developed by Politzer [1], in which CTCs are formed due to theidentification of a single spatial region at one time with the same region atanother time. For certain initial data, the total cross-section of a scatteringexperiment is shown to deviate from the standard value (the value predicted ifno CTCs existed). It is shown that if the time machines are small, sparselydistributed, or far away, then the deviation in the total cross-section may benegligible as compared to the experimental error of even the most accuratemeasurements of cross-sections. For a spacetime with CTCs at all points, or onewhere microscopic time machines pervade the spacetime in the final momentsbefore the big crunch, the total cross-section is shown to agree with thestandard result (no CTCs) due to a cancellation effect.
