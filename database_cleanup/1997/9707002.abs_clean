Title: D-Particles, D-Instantons, and A Space-Time Uncertainty Principle in

String TheoryComments: Talk given at the APCTP-ICTP Joint International Conference '97 (May

26-30, Seoul, Korea), 17pages, latex in mprocl.sty, no figuresThe purpose of this talk is to review some considerations by the presentauthor on the possible role of a simple space-time uncertainty relation towardnonperturbative string theory. We first motivate the space-time uncertaintyrelation as a simple space-time characterization of the fundamental stringtheory. We then argue that the relation captures some of the important aspectsof the short-distance dynamics of D-particles described by the effective superYang-Mills matrix quantum mechanics, and also that the recently proposed typeIIB matrix model can be regarded as a possible realization of the space-timeuncertainty principle.
