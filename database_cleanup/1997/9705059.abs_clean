The radiation reaction of a BPS monopole in the presence of incidentelectromagnetic waves as well as massless Higgs waves is analyzed classically.The reactive forces are compared to those of $W$ boson that is interpreted as adual partner of the BPS monopole. It is shown that the damping of accelerationis dual to each other, while in the case of finite size effects the duality isbroken explicitly. Their implications on the duality are discussed.
