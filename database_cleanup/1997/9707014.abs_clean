If one begins with the assertion that the type IIA string compactified on aK3 surface is equivalent to the heterotic string on a four-torus one may try tofind a statement about duality in ten dimensions by decompactifying thefour-torus. Such a decompactification renders the K3 surface highly singular.The resultant K3 surface may be analyzed in two quite different ways - one ofwhich is natural from the point of view of differential geometry and the otherfrom the point of view of algebraic geometry. We see how the former leads to a"squashed K3 surface" and reproduces the Horava-Witten picture of the heteroticstring in M-theory. The latter produces a "stable degeneration" and is tiedmore closely to F-theory. We use the relationship between these degenerationsto obtain the M-theory picture of a point-like E8-instanton directly from theF-theory picture of the same object.
