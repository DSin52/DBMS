The colliding plane wave metric discovered by Ferrari and Iba\~{n}ez to belocally isometric to the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole is extended tothe case of general axion-dilaton black holes. Because the transformation mapseither black hole horizon to the focal plane of the colliding waves, thisentire class of colliding plane wave spacetimes only suffers from the formationof spacetime singularities in the limits where the inner horizon itself issingular, which occur in the Schwarzschild and dilaton black hole limits. Thesupersymmetric limit corresponding to the extreme axion-dilaton black holeyields the Bertotti-Robinson metric with the axion and dilaton fields flowingto fixed constant values. The maximal analytic extension of this metric acrossthe Cauchy horizon yields a spacetime in which two sandwich waves in acylindrical universe collide to produce a semi-infinite chain ofReissner-Nordstrom-like wormholes. The focussing of particle and stringgeodesics in this spacetime is explored.
