We find exact solutions for N=2 supersymmetric SO(N), N=7,9,10,11,12 gaugetheories with matter in the fundamental and spinor representation. Thesetheories, with specific numbers of vectors and spinors, arise naturally in thecompactification of type IIA string theory on suitably chosen Calabi-Yauthreefolds. Exact solutions are obtained by using mirror symmetry to find thecorresponding type IIB compactification. We propose generalizations of theseresults to cases with arbitrary numbers of massive vectors and spinors.
