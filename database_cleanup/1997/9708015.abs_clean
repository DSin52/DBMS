We investigate Seiberg's N=1 field theory duality for four-dimensionalsupersymmetric QCD with the M-theory 5-brane. We find that the M-theoryconfiguration for the magnetic dual theory arises via a smooth deformation ofthe M-theory configuration for the electric theory. The creation of Dirichlet4-branes as Neveu-Schwarz 5-branes are passed through each other in Type IIAstring theory is given a nice derivation from M-theory.
