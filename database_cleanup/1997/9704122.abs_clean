Title: On the Field Strength Formulation of Effective QED3

Authors: C. D. Fosco

Comments: 10 pages, Latex. References added

Halpern's field strength's formulation of gauge theories is applied toeffective QED_3, namely, a gauge invariant theory for an Abelian gauge field$A_\mu$ with non-localities and self-interactions. The resulting description interms of the pseudovector field $\tilde{F}_\mu =\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda}\partial_\nu A_\lambda$ is applied to differentexamples.
