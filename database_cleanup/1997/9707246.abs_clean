We consider open supermembranes in eleven dimensions in the presence ofclosed M-Theory five-branes. It has been shown that, in a flat space-time, theworld-volume action is kappa invariant and preserves a fraction of the elevendimensional supersymmetries if the boundaries of the membranes lie on thefive-branes. We calculate the reparametrisation anomalies due to the chiralfermions on the boundaries of the membrane and examine their cancellationmechanism. We show that these anomalies cancel with the aid of a classical termin the world-volume action, provided that the tensions of the five-brane andthe membrane are related to the eleven dimensional gravitational constant in away already noticed in M-Theory.
