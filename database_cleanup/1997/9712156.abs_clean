NATO-ASI on Strings, Branes and Dualities, Cargese, France, 1997An overview over effects of D-instantons in ten dimensional IIB superstringtheory is given, including the supergravity instanton solution, instantoninduced effective interaction vertices, the conjectured $SL(2,Z)$ invariantcompletion of such terms and the connection of such terms to a one loopcalculation in eleven dimensional supergravity.
