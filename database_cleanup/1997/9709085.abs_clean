Authors: Carlos M. Naon

Comments: 25 pages, latex, no figures. Talk delivered at Trends in Theoretical

Physics - CERN - Santiago de Compostela - La Plata Meeting, La Plata,April-May 1997, to be published. Abstract modifiedIn this talk I describe a recently introduced field-theoretical approach thatcan be used as an alternative framework to study one-dimensional systems ofhighly correlated particles.
