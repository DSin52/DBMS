Title: The Standard model within noncommutative geometry

modelsComments: 14 pages, LaTEX

Algebraic Yang-Mills-Higgs theories based on noncommutative geometry havebrought forth novel extensions of gauge theories with interesting applicationsto phenomenology. We sketch the model of Connes and Lott, as well as variantsof it, and the model developed by a Mainz-Marseille group, by comparing them ina schematic way. The role of fermion masses and mixings is discussed, and thequestion of possible parameter relations is briefly touched.
