We consider Yang-Mills theory in a general class of Abelian gauges.Exploiting the residual Abelian symmetry on a quantum level, we derive a set ofWard identities in functional form, valid to all orders in perturbation theory.As a consequence, the coupling constant is only renormalised through theAbelian two-point function. This implies that asymptotic freedom in all Abeliangauges can be understood from an effective Abelian theory alone, which can beinterpreted as Abelian dominance in the high energy regime.
