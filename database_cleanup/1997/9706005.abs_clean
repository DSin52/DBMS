We consider F-theory compactifications on a mirror pair of ellipticCalabi-Yau threefolds. This yields two different six-dimensional theories, eachof them being nonperturbatively equivalent to some compactification ofheterotic strings on a K3 surface S with certain bundle data E --> S. We findevidence for a transformation of S together with the bundle that takes oneheterotic model to the other.
