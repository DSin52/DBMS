The background field method for N=2 super Yang-Mills theories in harmonicsuperspace is developed. The ghost structure of the theory is investigated. Itis shown that the ghosts include two fermionic real omega-hypermultiplets(Faddeev-Popov ghosts) and one bosonic real omega-hypermultiplet(Nielsen-Kallosh ghost), all in the adjoint representation of the gauge group.The one-loop effective action is analysed in detail and it is found that itsstructure is determined only by the ghost corrections in the pure superYang-Mills theory. As applied to the case of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory,realized in terms of N=2 superfields, the latter result leads to the remarkableconclusion that the one-loop effective action of the theory does not containquantum corrections depending on the N=2 gauge superfield only. We show thatthe leading low-energy contribution to the one-loop effective action in the N=2SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory coincides with Seiberg's perturbative holomorphiceffective action.
