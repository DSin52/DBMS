We calculate, to one-loop order, the ln (T) contributions of 3-pointfunctions in the \phi^3 and Yang-Mills theory at high temperature. We find thatthese terms are Lorentz invariant and have the same structure as theultraviolet divergent contributions which occur at zero temperature. A simpleargument, valid for all N-point Green functions, is given for this behavior.
