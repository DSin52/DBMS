Variables parametrized by closed and open curves are defined to reformulatecompact U(1) Quantum Electrodynamics in the circle with a massless fermionfield. It is found that the gauge invariant nature of these variablesaccommodates into a regularization scheme for the Hamiltonian and currentoperators that is specially well suited for the study of the compact case. Thezero mode energy spectrum, the value of the axial anomaly and the anomalouscommutators this model presents are hence determined in a manifestly gaugeinvariant manner. Contrary to the non compact case, the zero mode spectrum isnot equally spaced and consequently the theory does not lead to the spectrum ofa free scalar boson. All the states are invariant under large gaugetransformations. In particular, that is the case for the vacuum, andconsequently the $\theta$-dependence does not appear.
