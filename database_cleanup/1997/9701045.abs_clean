We consider N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with a simple classical gaugegroup, one adjoint $\Phi, N_f$ pairs ($Q_i,\tilde{Q_i}$) of (fundamental,anti-fundamental) and a tree-level superpotential with terms of theLandau-Ginzburg form $\tilde{Q}_i\Phi^lQ_j$. The quantum moduli space of thesemodels includes a Coulomb branch. We find hyperelliptic curves that encode thelow energy effective gauge coupling for the groups SO(N_c) and USp(N_c) (thecorresponding curve for SU(N_c) is already known). As a consistency check, wederive the sub-space of some vacua with massless dyons via confining phasesuperpotentials. We also discuss the existence and nature of the non-trivialsuperconformal points appearing when singularities merge in the Coulomb branch.
