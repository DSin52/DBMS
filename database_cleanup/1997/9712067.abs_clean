In (3+1) Hamiltonian form, the conditions for the electric/magneticinvariance of generic self-interacting gauge vector actions and the definitionof the duality generator are obvious. Instead, (3+1) actions are notintrinsically Lorentz invariant. Imposing the Dirac-Schwinger stress tensorcommutator requirement to enforce the latter yields a differential constrainton the Hamiltonian which translates into the usual Lagrangian form of theduality invariance condition obeyed by Maxwell and Born-Infeld theories. Wealso discuss covariance properties of some analogous scalar models.
