A phenomenon of classical quantization is discussed. This is revealed in theclass of pseudoclassical gauge systems with nonlinear nilpotent constraintscontaining some free parameters. Variation of parameters does not change local(gauge) and discrete symmetries of the corresponding systems, but there aresome special discrete values of them which give rise to the maximal globalsymmetries at the classical level. Exactly the same values of the parametersare separated at the quantum level, where, in particular, they are singled outby the requirement of conservation of the discrete symmetries. The phenomenonis observed for the familiar pseudoclassical model of 3D P,T-invariant massivefermion system and for a new pseudoclassical model of 3D P,T-invariant systemof topologically massive U(1) gauge fields.
