We review some recent developments in the study of M-theory compactificationsvia Matrix theory. In particular we highlight the appearance of IIA strings andtheir interactions, and explain the unifying role of the M-theory five-branefor describing the spectrum of the T^5 compactification and its dualitysymmetries. The 5+1-dimensional micro-string theory that lives on the fivebraneworld-volume takes a central place in this presentation.
