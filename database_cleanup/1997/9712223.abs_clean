We point out that the matrix description of M-theory compactified onCalabi-Yau threefolds is in many respects simpler than the matrix descriptionof a $T^6$ compactification. This is largely because of the differences betweenD6 branes wrapped on Calabi-Yau threefolds and D6 branes wrapped on six-tori.In particular, if we define the matrix theory following the prescription of Senand Seiberg, we find that the remaining degrees of freedom are decoupled fromgravity.
