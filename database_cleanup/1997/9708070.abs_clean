Comments: Invited talk at the "Nato Advanced Research Workshop on Theoretical

Physics", June 14-20, Zakopane, Poland. LaTeX2e with "plenum" and "amssymb"usepackages. 8 pagesJournal-ref: NATO ASI Series (Plenum) B 366 (1998) 171-178

I review the properties of a matrix action of relevance for IIB superstrings.This model generalizes the action proposed by Ishibashi, Kawai, Kitazawa, andTsuchiya by introducing an auxillary field Y, which is the matrix version ofthe auxillary field g in the Schild action.
