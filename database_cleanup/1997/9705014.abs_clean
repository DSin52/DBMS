We calculate an effective action and measure induced by the integration overthe auxiliary field in the matrix model recently proposed to describe IIBsuperstrings. It is shown that the measure of integration over the auxiliarymatrix is uniquely determined by locality and reparametrization invariance ofthe resulting effective action. The large--$N$ limit of the induced measure forstring coordinates is discussed in detail. It is found to be ultralocal and,thus, possibly is irrelevant in the continuum limit. The model of the GKM typeis considered in relation to the effective action problem.
