Exact expectation values of the fields e^{a\phi} in the Bullough-Dodd modelare derived by adopting the ``reflection relations'' which involve thereflection S-matrix of the Liouville theory, as well as special analyticityassumption. Using this result we propose explicit expressions for expectationvalues of all primary operators in the c<1 minimal CFT perturbed by theoperator \Phi_{1,2} or Phi_{2,1}. Some results concerning the $\Phi_{1,5}$perturbed minimal models are also presented.
