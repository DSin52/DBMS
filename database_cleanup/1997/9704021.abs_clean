We obtain forms of Born-Infeld and D-brane actions that are quadratic inderivatives of $X$ and linear in $F_{\mu \nu}$ by introducing an auxiliary`metric' which has both symmetric and anti-symmetric parts, generalising thesimplification of the Nambu-Goto action for $p$-branes using a symmetricmetric. The abelian gauge field appears as a Lagrange multiplier, and solvingthe constraint gives the dual form of the $n$ dimensional action with an $n-3$form gauge field instead of a vector gauge field. We construct the dual actionexplicitly, including cases which could not be covered previously. Thegeneralisation to supersymmetric D-brane actions with local fermionic symmetryis also discussed.
