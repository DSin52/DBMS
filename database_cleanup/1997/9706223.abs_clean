We explore the quantum properties of self-dual gravity formulated as a large$N$ two-dimensional WZW sigma model. Using a non-trivial classical background,we show that a $(2,2)$ space-time is generated. The theory contains an infiniteseries of higher point vertices. At tree level we show that, in spite of thepresence of higher than cubic vertices, the on-shell 4 and higher pointfunctions vanish, indicating that this model is related with the field theoryof closed N=2 strings. We examine the one-loop on-shell 3-point amplitude andshow that it is ultra-violet finite.
