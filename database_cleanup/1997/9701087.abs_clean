By applying an inverse Landau-Khalatnikov transformation, connecting(resummed) Schwinger-Dyson treatments in non-local and Landau gauges of$QED_3$, we derive the infrared behaviour of the wave-function renormalizationin the Landau gauge, and the associated critical exponents in the normal phaseof the theory (no mass generation). The result agrees with the one conjecturedin earlier treatments. The analysis involves an approximation, namely anexpansion of the non-local gauge in powers of momenta in the infrared. Thisapproximation is tested by reproducing the critical number of flavoursnecessary for dynamical mass generation in the chiral-symmetry-broken phase of$QED_3$.
