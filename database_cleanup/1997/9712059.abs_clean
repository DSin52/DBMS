An alternative path is taken for deriving an action for the supersymmetric5-brane in 11 dimensions. Selfduality does not follow from the action, but isconsistent with the equations of motion for arbitrary supergravity backgrounds.The action involves a 2-form as well as a 5-form world-volume potential;inclusion of the latter makes the action, as well as the non-linear selfdualityrelation for the 3-form field strength, polynomial. The requirement ofinvariance under kappa-transformations determines the form of the selfdualityrelation, as well as the action. The formulation is shown to be equivalent toearlier formulations of 5-brane dynamics.
