Title: Duality, Strings and Supergravity

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX; Plenary Talk given at the XII International Congress

of Mathematical Physics, 13-19 July 1997, Brisbane, AustraliaWe will report on recent advances in the understanding of non-perturbativeinterconnections between different string dualities. Weak-strong couplingduality (S-duality) and T-duality (symmetry under compactification on dualtori) allows one to compare and explore the strong coupling regime of seeminglyunrelated theories. These theories naturally merge in a quantum version ofsupergravity called M-theory. The dynamical role of `branes' of differentnature and the new dynamical tool of (M)atrix formulation of M-theory will bebriefly mentioned.
