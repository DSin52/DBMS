Title: Loop Variables and Gauge Invariant Interactions in String Theory

Comments: Latex file 13 pages. Talk given at the Puri Workshop on Frontiers in

Field Theory, Quantum Gravity and String Theory, in Dec 1996We describe a method of writing down the exact interacting gauge invariantequations for all the modes of the bosonic open string. It is a generalizationof the loop variable approach that was used earlier for the free, and lowestorder interacting cases. The generalization involves, as before, theintroduction of a parameter to label the different strings involved in aninteraction. The interacting string has thus becomes a ``band'' of finitewidth. As in the free case, the fields appear to be massless in one higherdimension. Although a proof of the consistency and gauge invariance to allorders (and thus of equivalence with string theory) is not yet available,plausibility arguments are given. We also give some simple illustrations of theprocedure.
