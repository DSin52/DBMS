Anomalous contributions to the Jacobi identity of chromo-electric fields andnon-Abelian vector currents are calculated using a non-perturbative approachthat combines operator product expansion and a generalization ofBjorken-Johnson-Low limit. The failure of the Jacobi identity and theassociated 3-cocycles are discussed.
