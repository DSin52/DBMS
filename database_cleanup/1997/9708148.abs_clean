We present new expressions of form factors of the XXZ model which satisfySmirnov's three axioms. These new form factors are obtained by acting theaffine quantum group $U_q (\hat{\frak s \frak l_2})$ to the known onesobtained in our previous works. We also find the relations among all the newand known form factors, i.e., all other form factors can be expressed as kindof descendents of a special one.
