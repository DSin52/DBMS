In this paper we study energy radiation from a moving mirror in 1+1dimensional space-time. The mirror is assumed to have finite mass andaccordingly to receive back reaction from scalar photon field. The modeexpansion of the scalar field becomes different from that without back reactionthough the trajectory of the mirror is not changed. Then energy density of thevacuum becomes to have finite value proportional to square of the mass of themirror. Moreover we compute the energy momentum tensor of the radiation in thecase that acceleration of the mirror is small. As a result we show that themirror creates energy radiation whose quantity does not depend on its mass buton its acceleration even if the acceleration is uniform.
