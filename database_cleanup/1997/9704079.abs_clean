We study the asymptotic solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation for thecolor-singlet reggeon compound states in multi-color QCD. We show that in theleading order of asymptotic expansion, quasiclassical reggeon trajectories havea form of the soliton waves propagating on the 2-dimensional plane oftransverse coordinates. Applying methods of the finite-gap theory we constructtheir explicit form in terms of Riemann theta-functions and examine theirproperties.
