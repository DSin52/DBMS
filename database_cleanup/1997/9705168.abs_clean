A method for solving Schwinger-Dyson equations for the Green functiongenerating functional of non-Abelian gauge theory is proposed. The method isbased on an approximation of Schwinger-Dyson equations by exactly solubleequations. For the SU(2) model the first step equations of the iteration schemeare solved which define a gauge field propagator. Apart from the usualperturbative solution, a non-perturbative solution is found which correspondsto the spontaneous symmetry breaking and obeys infrared finite behaviour of thepropagator.
