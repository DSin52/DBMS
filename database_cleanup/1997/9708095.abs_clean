The concept of scaling algebra provides a novel framework for the generalstructural analysis and classification of the short distance properties ofalgebras of local observables in relativistic quantum field theory. In thepresent article this method is applied to the simple example of massive freefield theory in s = 1,2 and 3 spatial dimensions. Not quite unexpectedly, oneobtains for s = 2,3 in the scaling (short distance) limit the algebra of localobservables in massless free field theory. The case s =1 offers, however, somesurprises. There the algebra of observables acquires in the scaling limit anon-trivial center and describes charged physical states satisfying Gauss' law.The latter result is of relevance for the interpretation of the Schwinger modelat short distances and illustrates the conceptual and computational virtues ofthe method.
