Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 57 (1997) 220-222

Conditions which must be satisfied by the gauge-fixing fermion $\chi$ used inthe BRST quantisation of constrained systems are established. These ensure thatthe extension of the Hamiltonian by the gauge-fixing term $[\Omega, \chi]$(where $\Omega$ is the BRST charge) gives the correct path integral.
