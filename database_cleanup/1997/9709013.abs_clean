We consider type IIB theory compactified on a two-sphere in the presence ofmutually nonlocal 7-branes. The BPS states associated with the gauge vectors ofexceptional groups are seen to arise from open strings connecting the 7-branes,and multi-pronged open strings capable of ending on more than two 7-branes.These multi-pronged strings are built from open string junctions that arisenaturally when strings cross 7-branes. The different string configurations canbe multiplied as traditional open strings, and are shown to generate thestructure of exceptional groups.
