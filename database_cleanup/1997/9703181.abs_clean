Embedding of Klein-Gordon and Dirac particle onto Riemannian submanifold inhigher dimensional Minkowski space is given by using Hamiltonian BRSTformalism. Up to the ordering and quantum potential term induced by embedding,obtained K-G equation is the usual one in Riemannian space, instead, theobtained Dirac equation is essentially different from the usual well known formusing vierbein. The requirement of equivalence between two Dirac equationsgives the property of natural-frame for spinor.
