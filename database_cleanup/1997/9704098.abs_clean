We consider the Witten index ${\cal I}= Tr (-1)^F$ of SU(2) Super-Yang-Millsquantum mechanics (SYMQ) with N=16, 8, 4 supersymmetries. The theory governsthe interactions between a pair of D-branes under various circumstances, andour goal is to count the number of the threshold bound states directly fromthe low-energy effective theory. The string theory and M theory have predictedthat ${\cal I}=1$ for N=16, which in fact forms an underlying hypothesis ofthe M(atrix) theory formulation. Also the consistency of conifold transitionsin type II theories is known to require ${\cal I}=0$ for N=8 and 4. Here, thebulk contribution to ${\cal I}$ is computed explicitly, and for N=16, 8, 4,found to be 5/4, 1/4, 1/4 respectively, suggesting a common defectcontribution of -1/4. We illustrate how the defect term of -1/4 may arise inthe SU(2) SYMQ by considering the effective dynamics along the asymptoticregion.
