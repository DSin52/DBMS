Title: Hidden Symmetries of the Principal Chiral Model and a Nonstandard Loop

AlgebraAuthors: C. Devchand and Jeremy Schiff

Comments: 5 pages, latex; changed title and slight textual revisions; to be

published in Phys. Lett. BWe examine the precise structure of the loop algebra of `dressing' symmetriesof the Principal Chiral Model, and discuss a new infinite set of abeliansymmetries of the field equations which preserve a symplectic form on the spaceof solutions.
