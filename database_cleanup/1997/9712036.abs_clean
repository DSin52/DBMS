We repeat the known procedure of the derivation of the set of Procaequations. It is shown that it can be written in various forms. The importanceof the normalization is point out for the problem of the correct description ofspin-1 quantized fields. Finally, the discussion of the so-called Kalb-Ramondfield is presented.
