We discuss topological theories, arising from the general $\CN=2$ twistedgauge theories. We initiate a program of their study in the Gromov-Wittenparadigm. We re-examine the low-energy effective abelian theory in the presenceof sources and study the mixing between the various $p$-observables. We presentthe twisted superfield formalism which makes duality transformationstransparent. We propose a scheme which uniquely fixes all the contact terms. Wederive a formula for the correlation functions of $p$-observables on themanifolds of generalized simple type for $0 \leq p \leq 4$ and on somemanifolds with $b_{2}^{+} =1$. We study the theories with matter and explorethe properties of universal instanton. We also discuss the compactifications ofhigher dimensional theories. Some relations to sigma models of type $A$ and $B$are pointed out and exploited.
