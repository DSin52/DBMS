In the present paper we study the Faddeev-Popov path integral quantization ofelectrodynamics in an inhomogenious dielectric medium. We quantize allpolarizations of the photons and introduce the corresponding ghost fields.Using the heat kernel technique, we express the heat kernel coefficients interms of the dielectricity $\epsilon (x)$ and calculate the ultra violetdivergent terms in the effective action. No cancellation between ghosts and"non-physical" degrees of freedom of the photon is observed.
