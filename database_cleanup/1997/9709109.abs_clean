Starting from SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in 3+1 dimensions, we prove that theabelian-projected effective gauge theories are written in terms of the maximalabelian gauge field and the dual abelian gauge field interacting with monopolecurrent. This is performed by integrating out all the remaining non-Abeliangauge field belonging to SU(2)/U(1). We show that the resulting abelian gaugetheory recovers exactly the same one-loop beta function as the originalYang-Mills theory. Moreover, the dual abelian gauge field becomes massive ifthe monopole condensation occurs. This result supports the dual superconductorscenario for quark confinement in QCD. We give a criterion of dualsuperconductivity and point out that the monopole condensation can be estimatedfrom the classical instanton configuration. Therefore there can exist theeffective abelian gauge theory which shows both asymptotic freedom and quarkconfinement based on the dual Meissner mechanism. Inclusion of arbitrary numberof fermion flavors is straightforward in this approach. Some implications tolower dimensional case will also be discussed.
