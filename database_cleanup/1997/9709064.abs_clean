We consider the extremal limit of a black hole geometry of theReissner-Nordstrom type and compute the quantum corrections to its entropy.Universally, the limiting geometry is the direct product of two 2-dimensionalspaces and is characterized by just a few parameters. We argue that the quantumcorrections to the entropy of such extremal black holes due to a masslessscalar field have a universal behavior. We obtain explicitly the form of thequantum entropy in this extremal limit as function of the parameters of thelimiting geometry. We generalize these results to black holes with toroidal orhigher genus horizon topologies. In general, the extreme quantum entropy iscompletely determined by the spectral geometry of the horizon and in theultra-extreme case it is just a determinant of the 2-dimensional Laplacian. Asa byproduct of our considerations we obtain expressions for the quantum entropydilaton and extreme Kerr-Newman black holes. In both cases the classicalBekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified by logarithmic corrections.
