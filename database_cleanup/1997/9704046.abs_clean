Title: Deformed supergravity with local R-symmetry

Comments: 19 pages, latex2.09 (works also with latex2e), no figures

Using deformation theory based on BRST cohomology, a supergravity model isconstructed which interpolates through a continuous deformation parameterbetween new minimal supergravity with an extra U(1) gauge multiplet andstandard supergravity with local R-symmetry in a formulation with a nonstandardset of auxiliary fields. The deformation implements an electromagnetic dualityrelating the extra U(1) to the R-symmetry. A consistent representative of theR-anomaly in the model is proposed too.
