Title: Global Anomalies and Geometric Engineering of Critical Theories in Six

DimensionsComments: Three additional infinite series are constructed in F-theory which do

not have field theory realization. Also some references are added. 13 pagesWe show the existence of global gauge anomalies in six dimensions for gaugegroups SU(2),SU(3) and G_2 coupled to matter, characterized by an element ofZ_{12},Z_6 and Z_3 respectively. Consideration of this anomaly rules out someof the recently proposed 6 dimensional N=1 QFT's which were conjectured topossess IR fixed point at infinite coupling. We geometrically engineeressentially all the other models with one tensor multiplet using F-theory. Inaddition we construct 3 infinite series using F-theory geometry which do nothave field theory analogs. All these models in the maximally Higgsed phasecorrespond to the strong coupling behaviour of E_8 x E_8 heterotic stringcompactification on K3 with instanton numbers (12+n,12-n).
