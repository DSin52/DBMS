We discuss, in the context of M(atrix) theory, the creation of a membranesuspendend between two longitudinal five-branes when they cross each other. Itis shown that the membrane creation is closely related to the degrees offreedom in the off-diagonal blocks which are related via dualities to thechiral fermionic zero mode on a 0-8 string. In the dual system of a D0-braneand a D8-brane in type \IIA theory the half-integral charges associated withthe ``half''-strings are found to be connected to the well-known fermion-numberfractionalization in the presence of a fermionic zero mode. At sufficientlyshort distances, the effective potential between the two five-branes isdominated by the zero mode contribution to the vacuum energy.
