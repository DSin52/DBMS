We describe a dynamical worldsheet origin for the Lagrangian describing thelow-energy dynamics of a system of parallel D-branes. We show how matrix-valuedcollective coordinate fields for the D-branes naturally arise as couplings of aworldsheet sigma-model, and that the quantum dynamics require that thesecouplings be mutually noncommutative. We show that the low-energy effectiveaction for the sigma-model couplings describes the propagation of an openstring in the background of the multiple D-brane configuration, in which allstring interactions between the constituent branes are integrated out and thegenus expansion is taken into account, with a matrix-valued coupling. Theeffective field theory is governed by the non-abelian Born-Infeld target spaceaction which leads to the standard one for D-brane field theory.
