We show that the baryon number of N=2 supersymmetric QCD can be twisted inorder to couple the topological field theory of non-abelian monopoles to$Spin^c$-structures. To motivate the construction, we also consider someaspects of the twisting procedure as a gauging of global currents in two andfour dimensions, in particular the role played by anomalies.
