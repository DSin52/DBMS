Proceedings SILAFAE 1996A global analysis of duality transformations is presented. It is shown thatduality between quantum field theories exists only when the geometricalstructure of the quantum configuration spaces of the theories comply withcertain precise conditions. Applications to S-dual actions and to T duality ofstring theories and D-branes are briefly discussed.It is shown that a newtopological term in the dual open string actions is required. We also study anextension of the procedure to construct duality maps among abelian gaugetheories to the non abelian case.
