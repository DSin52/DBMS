Title: Effective abelian gauge theory for lattice gluodynamics and

chromoelectric stringComments: 10pp., Latex

The lattice SU(2) gluodynamics in the maximal abelian projection is reducedto the abelian theory, in which the natural small parameter exists. We showthat in the zeroth order of the expansion in this parameter the theory isequivalent to the compact abelian gauge theory coupled to ghosts of charge 2.The theory is a renormalizable and asymptotically free. This theory isrepresented in the form of the theory of open string with the boundaryconsisting of the worldline of the quark. The ghosts live on the worldsheet ofthe string. The naive continuum limit of such string representation gives asimple expression for the chromoelectric string action.
