We discuss some aspects of perturbative $(0,2)$ Calabi-Yau moduli space. Inparticular, we show how models with different $(0,2)$ data can meet alongvarious sub-loci in their moduli space. In the simplest examples, the modelsdiffer by the choice of desingularization of a holomorphic V-bundle over thesame resolved Calabi-Yau base while in more complicated examples, even thesmooth Calabi-Yau base manifolds can be topologically distinct. These latterexamples extend and clarify a previous observation which was limited tosingular Calabi-Yau spaces and seem to indicate a multicritical structure inmoduli space. This should have a natural F-theory counterpart in terms of themoduli space of Calabi-Yau four-folds.
