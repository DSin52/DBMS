We use the Wilson-Fisher $\epsilon$ expansion to study quantum criticalbehavior in gauged Yukawa matrix field theories with weak quenched disorder. Wefind that the resulting quantum critical behavior is in the universality classof the pure system. As in the pure system, the phase transition is typicallyfirst order, except for a limited range of parameters where it can be secondorder with computable critical exponents. Our results apply to the study oftwo-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets with weak quenched disorder andprovide an example for fluctuation-induced first order phase transitions incircumstances where naively none is expected.
