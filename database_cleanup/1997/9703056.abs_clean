We obtain actions for N D-branes occupying points in a manifold witharbitrary Kahler metric. In one complex dimension, the action is uniquelydetermined (up to second order in commutators) by the requirement that itreproduce the masses of stretched strings and by imposing supersymmetry. Theseconditions are very restrictive in higher dimensions as well. The resultsprovide a noncommutative extension of Kahler geometry.
