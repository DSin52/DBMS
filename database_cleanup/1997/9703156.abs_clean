The absolute (moduli-independent) U-invariants of all N>2 extendedsupergravities at D=4 are derived in terms of (moduli-dependent) central andmatter charges. These invariants give a general definition of the``topological'' Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for extremal black-holes andreduce to the square of the black-hole ADM mass for ``fixed scalars'' whichextremize the black-hole ``potential'' energy. The Hessian matrix of theblack-hole potential at ``fixed scalars'', in contrast to N=2 theories, isshown to be degenerate, with rank (N-2)(N-3) + 2 n (N being the number ofsupersymmetries and n the number of matter multiplets) and semipositivedefinite.
