We present a study of M(atrix) theory from a purely canonical viewpoint. Inparticular, we identify free particle asymptotic states of the modelcorresponding to the supergraviton multiplet of eleven dimensionalsupergravity. These states have a natural interpretation as excitations in theflat directions of the matrix model potential. Furthermore, we provide thesplit of the matrix model Hamiltonian into a free part describing the freepropagation of these particle states along with the interaction Hamiltoniandescribing their interactions. Elementary quantum mechanical perturbationtheory then yields an effective potential for these particles as an expansionin their inverse separation. Remarkably we find that the leading velocityindependent terms of the effective potential cancel in agreement with the factthat there is no force between stationary D0 branes. The scheme we presentprovides a framework in which one can perturbatively compute the M(atrix)theory result for the eleven dimensional supergraviton S matrix.
