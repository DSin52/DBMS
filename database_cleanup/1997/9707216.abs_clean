A possible model for quantum kinematics of a test particle in a curvedspace-time is proposed. Every reasonable neighbourhood V_e of a curvedspace-time can be equipped with a nonassociative binary operation called thegeodesic multiplication of space-time points. In the case of the Minkowskispace-time, left and right translations of the geodesic multiplication coincideand amount to a rigid shift of the space-time x->x+a. In a curved space-timeinfinitesimal geodesic right translations can be used to define the (geodesic)momentum operators. The commutation relations of position and momentumoperators are taken as the quantum kinematic algebra. As an example, detailedcalculations are performed for the space-time of a weak plane gravitationalwave. The uncertainty relations following from the commutation rules arederived and their physical meaning is discussed.
