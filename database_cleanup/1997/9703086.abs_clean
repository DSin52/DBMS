We propose that the Virasoro algebra controls quantum cohomologies of generalFano manifolds $M$ ($c_1(M)>0$) and determines their partition functions at allgenera. We construct Virasoro operators in the case of complex projectivespaces and show that they reproduce the results of Kontsevich-Manin, Getzleretc. on the genus-0,1 instanton numbers. We also construct Virasoro operatorsfor a wider class of Fano varieties. The central charge of the algebra is equalto $\chi(M)$, the Euler characteristic of the manifold $M$.
