We study classical BPS five-brane solutions in the Horava-Wittensupergravity. The presence of the eleventh dimension add a new feature, namelythe dependence of the solution on this new coordinate. For gauge five-braneswith an instanton size less than the eleventh radius and in the neighborhood ofthe center of the neutral five-brane, important corrections to theten-dimensional solution appear for all values of the string coupling constant.We compute the mass and magnetic charge of the five-brane solitons and theresult is shown to agree with the membrane and five-brane quantizationconditions. Compactified to four dimensions, our solutions are interpreted asaxionic strings.
