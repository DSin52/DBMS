Title: Defining Relations for Lie Superalgebras with Cartan matrix

Comments: 19 pages, LaTeX

We completely describe presentations of Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrixif they are simple Z-graded of polynomial growth. Such matrices can be neitherinteger nor symmetrizable. There are non-Serre relations encountered. Incertain cases there are infinitely many relations. Our results are applicableto the Lie algebras with the same Cartan matrices as the Lie superalgebrasconsidered.
