We study the algebra of SU(n)-currents in the many-flavor chiral Gross-Neveumodel. The general structure of the current-current OPE leading to non-localquantum conserved charges is reviewed. We calculate the OPE in the one-flavorand the many-flavor models perturbatively and use renormalization groupinvariance to prove that our results are not altered by higher-ordercorrections. We conclude that in these models the non-local quantum chargeexists which is the first step towards the proof of the absence of particleproduction and factorization.
