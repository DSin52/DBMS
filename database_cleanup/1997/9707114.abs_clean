We describe an effective method for calculating certain infinite sums,generalizations of the classical Bernoulli polynomials. As shown by EdwardWitten in his papers on two-dimensional gauge theories, the correlationfunctions of two-dimensional topological Yang-Mills theory (or intersectionnumbers on moduli spaces of flat connections) can be given in the form of suchinfinite sums. Thus, in particular, our results give finite expressions forthese correlation functions in the case of arbitrary compact structure groups
