We describe in superspace a theory of a massive superparticle coupled to aversion of two dimensional N=1 dilaton supergravity. The (1+1) dimensionalsupergravity is generated by the stress-energy of the superparticle, and theevolution of the superparticle is reciprocally influenced by the supergravity.We obtain exact superspace solutions for both the superparticle worldline andthe supergravity fields. We use the resultant non-trivial compensatorsuperfield solution to construct a model of a two-dimensional supersymmetricblack hole.
