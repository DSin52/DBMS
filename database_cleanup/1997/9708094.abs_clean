We review some results recently obtained for the conformal field theoriesbased on the affine Lie superalgebra osp(1|2). In particular, we study therepresentation theory of the osp(1|2) current algebras and their characterformulas. By means of a free field representation of the conformal blocks, weobtain the structure constants and the fusion rules of the model.
