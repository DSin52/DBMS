In this paper the general form of scattering amplitudes for masslessparticles with equal spins s ($s s \to s s$) or unequal spins ($s_a s_b \to s_as_b$) are derived. The imposed conditions are that the amplitudes should havethe lowest possible dimension, have propagators of dimension $m^{-2}$, and obeygauge invariance. It is shown that the number of momenta required foramplitudes involving particles with s > 2 is higher than the number implied by3-vertices for higher spin particles derived in the literature. Therefore, thedimension of the coupling constants following from the latter 3-vertices has asmaller power of an inverse mass than our results imply. Consequently, the3-vertices in the literature cannot be the first interaction terms of agauge-invariant theory. When no spins s > 2 are present in the process theknown QCD, QED or (super) gravity amplitudes are obtained from the abovegeneral amplitudes.
