We examine the relations between observables in two- and three-dimensionalquantum gravity by studying the coupling of topologically massive gravity tomatter fields in non-trivial representations of the three-dimensional Lorentzgroup. We show that the gravitational renormalization of spin up to one-looporder in these theories reproduces the leading orders of the KPZ scalingrelations for quantum Liouville theory. We demonstrate that the two-dimensionalscaling dimensions can be computed from tree-level Aharonov-Bohm scatteringamplitudes between the charged particles in the limit where thethree-dimensional theory possesses local conformal invariance. We show how thethree-dimensional description defines scale-dependent weights by computing theone-loop order anomalous magnetic moment of fermions in a backgroundelectromagnetic field due to the renormalization by topologically massivegravity. We also discuss some aspects concerning the different phases ofthree-dimensional quantum gravity and argue that the topological ones may berelated to the branched polymer phase of two-dimensional quantum gravity.
