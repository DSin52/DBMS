Non-commutative differential geometry allows a scalar field to be regarded asa gauge connection, albeit on a discrete space. We explain how the underlyinggauge principle corresponds to the independence of physics on the choice ofvacuum state, should it be non-unique. A consequence is that Yang-Mills-Higgstheory can be reformulated as a generalised Yang-Mills gauge theory onEuclidean space with a $Z_2$ internal structure. By extending the Hodge staroperation to this non-commutative space, we are able to define the notion ofself-duality of the gauge curvature form in arbitrary dimensions. It turns outthat BPS monopoles, critically coupled vortices, and kinks are all self-dualsolutions in their respective dimensions. We then prove, within this unifiedformalism, that static soliton solutions to the Yang-Mills-Higgs system existonly in one, two and three spatial dimensions.
