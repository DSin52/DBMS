We study the Born-Infeld equation from a Lagrangian point of view emphasizingthe duality symmetry present in such systems. We obtain the Hamiltonianformulation directly from the Lagrangian. We also show that this system admitsa dispersionless nonstandard Lax representation which directly leads to all theconserved charges (including the ones not previously obtained). We also presentthe generating function for these charges and point out various otherproperties of this system.
