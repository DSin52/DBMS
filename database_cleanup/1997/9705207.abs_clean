We demonstrate how Sakharov's idea of induced gravity allows one to explainthe statistical-mechanical origin of the entropy of a black hole. According tothis idea, gravity becomes dynamical as the result of quantum effects in thesystem of heavy constituents of the underlying theory. The black hole entropyis related to the properties of the vacuum in the induced gravity in thepresence of the horizon. We obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by directcounting the states of the constituents.
