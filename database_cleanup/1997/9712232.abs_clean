We compute the genus one correction to the integrable hierarchy describingcoupling to gravity of a 2D topological field theory. The bihamiltonianstructure of the hierarchy is given by a classical W-algebra; we compute thecentral charge of this algebra. We also express the generating function ofelliptic Gromov - Witten invariants via tau-function of the isomonodromydeformation problem arising in the theory of WDVV equations of associativity.
