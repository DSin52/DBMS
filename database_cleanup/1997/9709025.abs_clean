A covariant action for closed D=11 superstring with local $\kappa$-symmetryand global supersymmetry transformations obeying the algebra$\{Q_\alpha,Q_\beta\}=C\Gamma^{\mu\nu}P_\mu n_\nu$ is suggested. Physicalsector variables of the model and their dynamics exactly coincide with those ofthe D=10 type IIA Green-Schwarz superstring. It is shown that action of theD=10 type IIA Green-Schwarz superstring can be considered as a partially gaugefixed version of the D=11 superstring action.
