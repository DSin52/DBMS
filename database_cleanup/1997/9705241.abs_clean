String theory on D-brane backgrounds is open-closed string theory. Given therelevance of this fact, we give details and elaborate upon our earlierconstruction of oriented open-closed string field theory. In order toincorporate explicitly closed strings, the classical sector of this theory isopen strings with a homotopy associative A_\infty algebraic structure. We builda suitable Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra on moduli spaces of bordered Riemannsurfaces, the construction of which involves a few subtleties arising from theopen string punctures and cyclicity conditions. All vertices coupling open andclosed strings through disks are described explicitly. Subalgebras of thealgebra of surfaces with boundaries are used to discuss symmetries of classicalopen string theory induced by the closed string sector, and to write classicalopen string field theory on general closed string backgrounds. We give apreliminary analysis of the ghost-dilaton theorem.
