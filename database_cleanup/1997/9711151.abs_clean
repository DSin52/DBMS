We give efficient superspace methods for deriving component actions forsupergravity coupled to matter. One method uses normal coordinates tocovariantly expand the superfield action, and can be applied straightforwardlyto any superspace. The other interprets the component lagrangian as adifferential form on a bosonic hypersurface in superspace, and gives a simplederivation for pertinent cases such as chiral superspace.
