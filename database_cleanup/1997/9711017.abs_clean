A recent proposal for 6d "gauge" theories with rational theta angle isdiscussed. These theories were constructed from n_C coinciding (p,q) 5-branesof IIB in the limit of vanishing string constant. They have (1,1) supersymmetryand the low energy theory is 6d Yang-Mills with gauge group SU(n_C) and arational theta angle theta_6/(2 pi)=f/q, where fp=1 (mod q). By changing thepoint of view, considering the (p,q) 5-branes to be D5-branes, the 6d thetaangle is identified with a 10d theta angle. This point of view together withsome assumptions suggests a generalization of the previous limit to arbitrarytheta. This limit seems to define a decoupled 6d theory even though the 10dtheory does not become free in general.
