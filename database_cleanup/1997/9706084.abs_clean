The asymptotic behaviour of cubic field theories is investigated in the Reggelimit using the techniques of environmentally friendly renormalization,environmentally friendly in the present context meaning asymmetric in itsmomentum dependence. In particular we consider the crossover between large andsmall energies at fixed momentum transfer for a model scalar theory of the typephi^2 psi. The asymptotic forms of the crossover scaling functions areexhibited for all two particle scattering processes in this channel to one loopin a renormalization group improved perturbation theory.
