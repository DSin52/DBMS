Connes' view at Yang-Mills theories is reviewed with special emphasis on thegauge invariant scalar product. This landscape is shown to contain Chamseddineand Connes' noncommutative extension of general relativity restricted to flatspace-time, if the top mass is between 172 and 204 GeV. Then the Higgs mass isbetween 188 and 201 GeV.
