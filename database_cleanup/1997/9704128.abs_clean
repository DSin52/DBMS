By studying classical realizations of the sl(2,R) algebra in a twodimensional phase space $(q,\pi)$, we have derived a continuous family of newactions for free anyons in 2+1 dimensions. For the case of light-like spinvector $(S_\mu S^\mu =0)$, the action is remarkably simple. We show theappearence of the Zitterbewegung in the solutions of the equations of motion,and relate the actions to others in the literature at classical level.
