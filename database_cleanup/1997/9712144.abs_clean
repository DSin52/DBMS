We examine finite temperature perturbation theory for Chern-Simons theories,in the context of an analogue 0+1-dimensional model. In particular, we show hownonextensive terms arise in the perturbative finite temperature effectiveaction, using both the real-time and imaginary-time formalisms. We illustratehow large gauge invariance is restored at all orders, despite being broken atany given order in perturbation theory. We discuss which aspects generalize toa perturbative analysis of finite temperature Chern-Simons terms in higherdimensions.
