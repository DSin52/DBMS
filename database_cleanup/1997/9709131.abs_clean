The reduced covariant phase space associated with the three-dimensionalEuclidean Nambu-Goto action can be identified, via the Enneper-Weierstrassrepresentation of minimal surfaces, with the space of complex analyticfunctions plus three translational zero modes. The symplectic structure inducedtrough the Enneper-Weierstrass map can be explicitly computed. Quantization isthen straightforward, yielding as a result a target-space Euclidean-invariant,positive-definite, two-dimensional quantum field theory. The physical statesare shown to correspond with particles states of integer spin and arbitrarymass.
