1516-1553A quantum theory is developed for the scattering of a nonrelativisticparticle in the field of a cosmic string regarded as a combination of amagnetic and gravitational strings. Allowance is made for the effects due tothe finite transverse dimensions of the string under fairly general assumptionsabout the distribution of the magnetic field and spatial curvature in thestring. It is shown that in a definite range of angles the differential crosssection at all absolute values of the wave vector of the incident particledepends strongly on the magnetic flux of the string.
