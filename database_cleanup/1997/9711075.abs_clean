Title: Reply to ``Proof of the Gauge Independence of the Conformal Anomaly of

Bosonic String in the Sense of Kraemmer and Rebhan''Authors: U. Kraemmer, A. Rebhan

Comments: 5 pages, Latex

In two recent preprints (hep-th/9710131 and hep-th/9710132), Abe andNakanishi have claimed that the proof of the gauge independence of theconformal anomaly of the bosonic string as given by us in 1988 was wrong. Asimilar allegation has been made concerning our proof of the gauge independenceof the sum of the ghost number and Lagrange multiplier anomalies innon-conformal gauges. In this short note we refute their criticism byexplaining the simple logic of our proofs and emphasizing the points that havebeen missed by Abe and Nakanishi.
