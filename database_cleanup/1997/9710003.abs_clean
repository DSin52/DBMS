The functional integral of the massless Schwinger model in $(1+1)$ dimensionsis reduced to an integral in terms of local gauge invariant quantities. Itturns out that this approach leads to a natural bosonisation scheme, yielding,in particular the famous `bosonisation rule'' and giving some deeper insightinto the nature of the bosonisation phenomenon. As an application, the chiralanomaly is calculated within this formulation.
