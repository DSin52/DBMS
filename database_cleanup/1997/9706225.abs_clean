Euclidean supersymmetric theories are obtained from Minkowskian theories byperforming a reduction in the time direction. This procedure elucidates certainmysterious features of Zumino's N=2 model in four dimensions, providesmanifestly hermitian Euclidean counterparts of all non-mimimal SYM theories,and is also applicable to supergravity theories. We reanalyse the twists of the4d N=2 and N=4 models from this point of view. Other applications include SYMtheories on special holonomy manifolds. In particular, we construct a twistedSYM theory on Kaehler 3-folds and clarify the structure of SYM theory onhyper-Kaehler 4-folds.
