It is known that weak coupling calculations of absorption or emission byslightly non-extremal D-brane configurations are in exact agreement withsemiclassical results for the black holes they describe at strong couplings. Weinvestigate one open string loop corrections to processes involving single andparallel D-branes and show that a class of relevant terms vanish, indicatingthat these processes are not renormalized. Our results have implications forfive dimensional black holes and extremal 3-branes.
