According to the proposal of Hanany and Witten, Coulomb branches of N=4 SU(n)gauge theories in three dimensions are isometric to moduli spaces of BPSmonopoles. We generalize this proposal to gauge theories with matter, whichallows us to describe the metrics on their spaces of vacua by means of thehyperk\"ahler quotient construction. To check the identification of modulispaces a comparison is made with field theory predictions. For SU(2) theorywith k fundamental hypermultiplets the Coulomb branch is expected to be the D_kALF gravitational instanton, so our results lead to a construction of suchspaces. In the special case of SU(2) theory with four or fewer fundamentalhypermultiplets we calculate the complex structures on the moduli spaces andcompare them with field-theoretical results. We also discuss some puzzles withbrane realizations of three-dimensional N=4 theories.
