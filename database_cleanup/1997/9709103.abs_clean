We derive the fusion rules for a basic series of admissible representationsof $\hat{sl}(3)$ at fractional level $3/p-3$. The formulae admit aninterpretation in terms of the affine Weyl group introduced by Kac andWakimoto. It replaces the ordinary affine Weyl group in the analogous formulafor the fusion rules multiplicities of integrable representations. Elements ofthe representation theory of a hidden finite dimensional graded algebra behindthe admissible representations are briefly discussed.
