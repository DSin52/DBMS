We obtain using Schwinger's proper time approach the Casimir-Euler-Heisenbergeffective action of fermion fluctuations for the case of an applied magneticfield. We implement here the compactification of one space dimension into acircle through anti-periodic boundary condition. Aside of higher ordernon-linear field effects we identify a novel contribution to the vacuumpermeability. These contributions are exceedingly small for normalelectromagnetism due to the smallness of the electron Compton wavelengthcompared to the size of the compactified dimension, if we take the latter asthe typical size of laboratory cavities, but their presence is thoughtprovoking, also considering the context of strong interactions.
