We construct brane configurations leading to chiral four dimensional N=1supersymmetric gauge theories. The brane realizations consist of intersectingNeveu-Schwarz five-branes and Dirichlet four-branes in non-flat spacetimebackgrounds. We discuss in some detail the construction in a C^2/Z_M orbifoldbackground. The infrared theory on the four-brane worldvolume is a fourdimensional N=1 SU(N)^M gauge theory with chiral matter representations. Wediscuss various consistency checks and show that the spectral curves describingthe Coulomb phase of the theory can be obtained once the orbifold braneconstruction is embedded in M-theory. We also discuss the addition of extravectorlike matter and other interesting generalizations.
