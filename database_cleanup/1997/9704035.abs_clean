The Ray-Singer torsion for a compact smooth hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifold${\cal H}^3$ is expressed in terms of Selberg zeta-functions, making use of theassociated Selberg trace formulae. Applications to the evaluation of thesemiclassical asymptotics of the Witten's invariant for the Chern-Simons theorywith gauge group SU(2) as well as to the sum over topologies in 3-dimensionalquantum gravity are presented.
