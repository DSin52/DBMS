A gap in the mathematical logic in derivations in quantum field theory arisesas consequence of variation before quantization. To close this gap the presentpaper introduces a mathematically rigorous variational calculus for operatorfields. Using quantization before variation it is demonstrated that theso-called naive results are correct; in particular both Noether's theorem andthe Ward-Takahashi identities retain full validity in quantum field theory.
