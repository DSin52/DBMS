(1998) 55-65We review the classical thermodynamics and the greybody factors of general(rotating) non-extreme black holes and discuss universal features of theirnear-horizon geometry. We motivate a microscopic interpretation of generalblack holes that relates the thermodynamics of an effective string theory tothe geometry of the black hole in the vicinity of both the outer and the innerevent horizons. In this framework we interpret several near-extreme examples,the universal low-energy absorption cross-section, and the emission of higherpartial waves from general black holes.
