The partition function of type IIA and B strings on R^6xK3, in the T^4/Z_2orbifold limit, is explicitly computed as a modular invariant sum over spinstrutures required by perturbative unitarity in order to extend the analysis toinclude type II strings on R^6 x W4, where W4 is associated with the tubemetric conformal field theory, given by the degrees of freedom transverse tothe Neveu-Schwarz fivebrane solution. This generates partition functions andperturbative spectra of string theories in six space-time dimensions,associated with the modular invariants of the level k affine SU(2) Kac-Moodyalgebra. These theories provide a conformal field theory (i.e. perturbative)probe of non-perturbative (fivebrane) vacua. We contrast them with theorieswhose N=(4,4) sigma-model action contains n_H=k+2 hypermultiplets as well asvector supermultiplets, and where k is the level just mentioned. In Appendix Bwe also give a D=6, N=(1,1) `free fermion' string model which has a differentmoduli space of vacua from the 81 parameter space relevant to the aboveexamples.
