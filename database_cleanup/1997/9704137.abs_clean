Coupling constant renormalization is investigated in 2 dimensional sigmamodels related by non Abelian duality transformations. In this respect it isshown that in the one loop order of perturbation theory the duals of a oneparameter family of models, interpolating between the SU(2) principal model andthe O(3) sigma model, exhibit the same behaviour as the original models. Forthe O(3) model also the two loop equivalence is investigated, and is found tobe broken just like in the already known example of the principal model.
