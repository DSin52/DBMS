The mathematical apparatus of non commutative geometry and operator algebraswhich Connes has brought to bear to construct a rational scheme for theinternal symmetries of the standard model is presented from the physicist'spoint of view. Gauge symmetry, anomaly freedom, conservation of electriccharge, parity violation and charge conjugation all play a vital role. When puttogether with a relatively simple set of algebraic algorithms they deliver manyof the features of the standard model which otherwise seem rather ad hoc.
