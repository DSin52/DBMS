The V-algebras are the non-local matrix generalization of the well-knownW-algebras. Their classical realizations are given by the second Poissonbrackets associated with the matrix pseudodifferential operators. In thispaper, by using the general Miura transformation, we give the decompositiontheorems for the second Poisson brackets, from which we are able to constructthe free field realizations for a class of V-algebras includingV_{(2k,2)}-algebras that corresponds to the Lie algebra of C_k-type as theparticular examples. The reduction of our discussion to the scalar caseprovides the similar result for the W_{BKP}-algebra.
