We explicitly construct soliton solutions in the low energy description ofM-theory on S^1/Z_2. It is shown that the 11-dimensional membrane is a BPSsolution of this theory if stretched between the Z_2 hyperplanes. A similarstatement holds for the 11-dimensional 5--brane oriented parallel to thehyperplanes. The parallel membrane and the orthogonal 5-brane, thoughsolutions, break all supersymmetries. Furthermore, we construct the analog ofthe gauge 5-brane with gauge instantons on the hyperplanes. This solutionvaries nontrivially along the orbifold direction due to the gauge anomalieslocated on the orbifold hyperplanes. Its zero mode part is identical to theweakly coupled 10-dimensional gauge 5-brane.
