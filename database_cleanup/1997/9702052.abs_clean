We consider a new MacDowell-Mansouri R^2-type of supergravity theory, anextension of conformal supergravity, based on the superalgebra Osp(1|8).Invariance under local symmetries with negative Weyl weight is achieved byimposing chirality-duality and double-duality constraints on curvatures, alongwith the usual constraint of vanishing supertorsion. An analysis of theremaining gauge symmetries shows that those with vanishing Weyl weight areinvariances of the action at the linearized level. For the symmetries withpositive Weyl weight we find that invariance of the action would requirefurther modifications of the transformation rules. This conclusion is supportedby a kinematical analysis of the closure of the gauge algebra.
