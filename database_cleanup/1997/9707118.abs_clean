We consider euclidean D-branes wrapping around manifolds of exceptionalholonomy in dimensions seven and eight. The resulting theory on theD-brane---that is, the dimensional reduction of 10-dimensional supersymmetricYang-Mills theory---is a cohomological field theory which describes thetopology of the moduli space of instantons. The 7-dimensional theory is an N_T= 2 (or balanced) cohomological theory given by an action potential ofChern-Simons type. As a by-product of this method, we construct a relatedcohomological field theory which describes the monopole moduli space on a7-manifold of G_2 holonomy.
