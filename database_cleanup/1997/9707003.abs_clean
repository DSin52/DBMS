We study the effect of the solitonic degrees of freedom in string cosmologyfollowing the line of Rama. The gas of solitonic p-brane is treated as aperfect fluid in a Brans-Dicke type theory. In this paper, we find exactcosmological solutions for any Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$ and for generalparameter $\gamma$ of equation of state and classify the cosmology of thesolutions on a parameter space of $\gamma$ and $\omega$.
