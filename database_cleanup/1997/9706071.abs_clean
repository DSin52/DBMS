We present the wave equation for a minimally coupled scalar field in thebackground of a rotating four-dimensional black hole that is parametrized byits mass, angular momentum, and four independent U(1) charges. The near horizonstructure is identical to the five-dimensional case, and suggestive of anunderlying description in string theory that is valid in the generalnon-extremal case. We calculate the greybody factors for the Hawking radiation.For sufficiently large partial wave number the emission spectrum can becalculated for general non-extremal black holes and any particle energy. Weinterpret this spectrum in terms of a multi-body process in an effective stringtheory.
