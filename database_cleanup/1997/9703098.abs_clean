We investigate consistency conditions for supersymmetric gauge theories inhigher dimensions. First, we give a survey of Seiberg's necessary conditionsfor the existence of such theories with simple groups in five and sixdimensions. We then make some comments on how theories in different dimensionsare related. In particular, we discuss how the Landau pole can be avoided intheories that are not asymptotically free in four dimensions, and the mixing oftensor and vector multiplets in dimensional reduction from six dimensions.
