Title: A Non-Renormalization Theorem for the d=1, N=8 Vector Multiplet

Comments: Uses harvmac, 16 pages. We correct an error pointed out by E. Witten

Sigma models describing low energy effective actions on D0-brane probes withN=8 supercharges are studied in detail using a manifestly d=1, N=4 super-spaceformalism. Two 0+1 dimensional N=4 multiplets together with their generalactions are constructed. We derive the condition for these actions to be N=8supersymmetric and apply these techniques to various D-brane configurations. Wefind that if in addition to N=8 supersymmetry the action must also have Spin(5)invariance, the form of the sigma model metric is uniquely determined by theone-loop result and is not renormalized perturbatively or non-perturbatively.
