Title: Physical fields and Clifford algebras II. Neutrino field

Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX, misprints and minor mistakes corrected

The neutrino field is considered in the framework of a complex Cliffordalgebra $\C_3\cong\C_2\oplus\stackrel{\ast}{\C}_2$. The factor-algebras${}^{\epsilon}\C_2$ and ${}^{\epsilon}\stackrel{\ast}{\C}_2$, which areobtained by means of homomorphic mappings $\C_3\to\C_2$ and$\C_3\to\stackrel{\ast}{\C}_2$, are identified with the neutrino andantineutrino fields, respectively. In this framework we have naturalexplanation for absence of right-handed neutrino and left-handed antineutrino.
