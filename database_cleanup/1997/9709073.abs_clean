SystemsWe establish the isomorphism between a nonlinear $\sigma$-model and theabelian gauge theory on an arbitrary curved background, which allows us toderive integrable models and the corresponding Lax representations from gaugetheoretical point of view. In our approach the spectral parameter is related tothe global degree of freedom associated with the conformal or Galileotransformations of the spacetime. The B$\ddot{\rm a}$cklund transformations arederived from Chern-Simons theory where the spectral parameter is defined interms of the extract compactified space dimension coordinate.
