We analyze the vacuum structure of N=2, SU(2) QCD with massive quarkhypermultiplets, once supersymmetry is softly broken down to N=0 with dilatonand mass spurions. We give general expressions for the low energy couplings ofthe effective potential in terms of elliptic functions to have a completenumerical control of the model. We study in detail the possible phases of thetheories with Nf = 1, 2 flavors for different values of the bare quark massesand the supersymmetry breaking parameters and we find a rich structure of firstorder phase transitions. The chiral symmetry breaking pattern of the Nf = 2theory is considered, and we obtain the pion Lagrangian for this model up totwo derivatives. Exact expressions are given for the pion masses and the piondecay constant in terms of the magnetic monopole description of chiral symmetrybreaking.
