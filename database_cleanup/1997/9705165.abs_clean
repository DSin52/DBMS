The entropy of a near-extremal black hole made of parallel D-branes has beenshown to agree, upto a numerical factor, with that of the gas of massless openstring states on the brane worldvolume when the string coupling is chosensuitably. We investigate the process of emission or absorption of masslessS-wave neutral scalars by these black holes. We show that with rather mildassumptions about the nature of the interactions between the scalar and openstring states, the D-brane cross-section generally fails to reproduce theuniversal low energy black hole cross-section except for 1-branes and 3-branes.
