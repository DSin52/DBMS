Chiral symmetry is dynamically broken in quenched, ladder QED at weak gaugecouplings when an external magnetic field is present. In this paper, we showthat chiral symmetry is restored above a critical chemical potential and thecorresponding phase transition is of first order. In contrast, the chiralsymmetry restoration at high temperatures (and at zero chemical potential) is asecond order phase transition.
