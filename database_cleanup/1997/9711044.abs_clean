We present some methods of determining explicit solutions for self-dualsupermembranes in 4+1 and 8+1 dimensions with spherical or toroidal topology.For configurations of axial symmetry, the continuous SU(\infty) Toda equationturns out to play a central role, and a specific method of determining all theperiodic solutions are suggested. A number of examples are studied in detail.
