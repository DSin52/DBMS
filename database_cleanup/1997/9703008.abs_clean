Title: S-Duality as an Open String Gauge Symmetry

Comments: 16 pages, TeX. The computational error of the previous version

is corrected; erratum added. The new derivation of the central terms in thesuperalgebra is presented and new physical motivation is givenThe paper discusses the connection between S-duality and string-theoreticpicture-changing formalism. The singular limit of the picture-changingtransformation at zero momentum leads to the presence of the topological 5-formcharge in the type IIB superalgebra which is attributed to the M5-brane. Thetopological charge defines the boundary D-brane state, which also is theanalogue of the monopole part of the Olive-Witten's result in field theory.Thecorrelation functions involving this non-perturbative state are computed.Thenon-perturbative D-brane states are associated with the ghost numbercohomologies, introduced in the paper. Connections with M(atrix) theory arediscussed.
