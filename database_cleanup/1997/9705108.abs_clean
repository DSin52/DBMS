We postulate that physical states are equivalent under coordinatetransformations. We then implement this equivalence principle first in the caseof one-dimensional stationary systems showing that it leads to the quantumanalogue of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation which in turn implies the Schroedingerequation. In this context the Planck constant plays the role of covariantizingparameter. The construction is deeply related to the GL(2,C)-symmetry of thesecond-order differential equation associated to the Legendre transformationwhich selects, in the case of the quantum analogue of the Hamiltoniancharacteristic function, self-dual states which guarantee its existence for anyphysical system. The universal nature of the self-dual states implies theSchroedinger equation in any dimension.
