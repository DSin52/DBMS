The conformal structure of Brans-Dicke gravity action is carefully studied.It is discussed that Brans-Dicke gravity action has definitely no conformalinvariance. It is shown, however, that this lack of conformal invarianceenables us to demonstrate that Brans-Dicke theory appears to have a bettershort-distance behavior than Einstein gravity as far as Euclidean path integralformulation for quantum gravity is concerned.
