The algebra of observables for identical particles on a line is formulatedstarting from postulated basic commutation relations. A realization of thisalgebra in the Calogero model was previously known. New realizations arepresented here in terms of differentiation operators and in terms ofSU(N)-invariant observables of the Hermitian matrix models. Some particularstructure properties of the algebra are briefly discussed.
