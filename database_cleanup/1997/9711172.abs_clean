We propose an extension of a recent non-perturbative method suited forsolving the N-body problem in (2+1)-gravity to the case of Chern-Simonssupergravity. Coupling with supersymmetric point particles is obtainedimplicitly by extending the DJH matching conditions of gravity. The consistentsolution of the interacting case is obtained by building a general non-trivialmapping, extending the superanalytic mapping, between a flat polydromic $X^M$supercoordinate system and a physical one $x^N$, representing the DJH matchingconditions around the superparticles. We show how to construct such a mappingin terms of analytic functions, and we give their exact expressions for the twobody case. The extension to the N body case is also discussed. In theMinkoskian coordinates the superparticles move freely, and in particular thefermionic coordinates $\Theta(\xi^N_{(i)})$ are constants, whose values can befixed by using the monodromy properties. While the bosonic part of thesupergeodesic equations are obtained, as in gravity, by measuring the bosonicdistance in Minkowskian space-time, we find that the fermionic geodesicequations can be defined only by requiring that a non-perturbative divergenceof the $X^M = X^M(x^N)$ mapping cancels out on the world-lines of thesuperparticles.
