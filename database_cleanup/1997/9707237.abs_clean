The implementation of modular invariance on the torus as a phase space at thequantum level is discussed in a group-theoretical framework. Unlike theclassical case, at the quantum level some restrictions on the parameters of thetheory should be imposed to ensure modular invariance. Two cases must beconsidered, depending on the cohomology class of the symplectic form on thetorus. If it is of integer cohomology class $n$, then full modular invarianceis achieved at the quantum level only for those wave functions on the toruswhich are periodic if $n$ is even, or antiperiodic if $n$ is odd. If thesymplectic form is of rational cohomology class $\frac{n}{r}$, a similar resultholds --the wave functions must be either periodic or antiperiodic on a torus$r$ times larger in both direccions, depending on the parity of $nr$.Application of these results to the Abelian Chern-Simons is discussed.
