The soliton structure of a gauge theory recently proposed to describe chiralexcitations in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect is investigated. A new typeof non-linear derivative Schr\"odinger equation emerges as an effectivedescription of the system that supports novel chiral solitons. We discuss theclassical properties of solutions with vanishing and non-vanishing boundaryconditions (dark solitons) and we explain their relation to integrable systems.The quantum analysis is also addressed in the framework of a semiclassicalapproximation improved by Renormalization Group arguments.
