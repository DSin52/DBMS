changed and simlified formulasThe osp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangian quantization of general gauge theories isformulated which applies also to massive fields. The formalism generalizes theSp(2)-covariant BLT approach and guarantees symplectic invariance of thequantized action. The dependence of the generating functional of Green'sfunctions on the choice of gauge in the massive case disappears in the limit m= 0. Ward identities related to osp(1,2) symmetry are derived. Massive gaugetheories with closed algebra are studied as an example.
