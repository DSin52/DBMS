We examine general properties of superembeddings, i.e., embeddings ofsupermanifolds into supermanifolds. The connection between an embeddingprocedure and the method of non-linearly realised supersymmetry is clarified,and we demonstrate how the latter arises as a special case of the former. As anillustration, the super-5-brane in 7 dimensions, containing a self-dual 3-formworld-volume field strength, is formulated in both languages, and provides anexample of a model where the embedding condition does not suffice to put thetheory on-shell.
