Title: Superbrane Actions and Geometrical Approach

Authors: Igor Bandos, Paolo Pasti, Dmitri Sorokin and Mario Tonin

Comments: Based on talks given by the authors at the Volkov Memorial Seminar

"Supersymmetry and Quantum field Theory" (Kharkov, January 5-7, 1997), LaTeXfile, 11 pages Misprints corrected, references addedWe review a generic structure of conventional (Nambu-Goto andDirac-Born-Infeld-like) worldvolume actions for the superbranes and show how itis connected through a generalized action construction with a doublysupersymmetric geometrical approach to the description of super-p-branedynamics as embedding world supersurfaces into target superspaces.
