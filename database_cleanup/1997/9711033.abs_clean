Title: On The Construction of Zero Energy States in Supersymmetric Matrix

Models IIIComments: 4 pages, Latex

For a supersymmetric Hamiltonian appearing in the matrix model related to 11dimensional supermembranes, zero energy states are constructed. A usefulsymmetry, and an energy-equipartition property is pointed out.
