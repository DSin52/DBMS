Title: Interaction of Non-Abelian Monopole with External Field

Authors: V.G. Kiselev and Ya.M. Shnir

Comments: 5 pages, laTeX, no figures. Talk given at the XXI International

Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics. July 1996, Goslar,Germany. To appear in the ProceedingsThe interaction of a nontrivial topological field configuration with theexternal fields is considered. The approach is based on the calculation of thezero modes excitation probability. We consider the interaction of thet'Hooft-Polyakov monopole with an external weak uniform magnetic field and thefield of another monopole.
