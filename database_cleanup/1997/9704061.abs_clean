We consider N=1 dualities in four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theoriesas a geometrical realization of wrapping D 6-branes around 3-cycles ofCalabi-Yau threefolds in type IIA string theory. By extending the recent workof Ooguri and Vafa to the case of $SU, SO and Sp$ gauge groups withadditional fields together with defining fields, we give simple geometricaldescriptions of the interrelation between the electric theory and its magneticdual in terms of the configuration of D 6-branes wrapped 3-cycles.
