Title: Massive Spectral Sum Rules for the Dirac Operator

Comments: LaTeX, 7 pages

Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B425 (1998) 151-157

Massive spectral sum rules are derived for Dirac operators of $SU(N_c)$ gaugetheories with $N_f$ flavors. The universal microscopic massive spectraldensities of random matrix theory, where known, are all consistent with thesesum rules.
