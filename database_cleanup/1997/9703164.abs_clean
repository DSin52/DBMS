We generalize a family of Lagrangians with values in the Poincar\'e groupISO(d-1,1), which contain the description of spinning strings in flat (d-1)+1dimensions, by including symmetric terms in the world-sheet coordinates. Then,by promoting a subgroup H=R^n, n less than or equal to d, which actsinvariantly from the left on the element of ISO(d-1,1), to a gauge symmetry ofthe action, we obtain a family of sigma-models. They describe bosonic stringsmoving in (generally) curved, and in some cases degenerate, space-times with anaxion field. Further, the space-times of the effective theory admit in generalT-dual geometries. We give explicit results for two non degenerate cases.
