Despite the many successes of the relativistic quantum theory developed byHorwitz, et. al., certain difficulties persist in the associated covariantclassical mechanics. In this paper, we explore these difficulties through anexamination of the classical Coulomb problem in the framework of off-shellelectrodynamics. As the local gauge theory of a covariant quantum mechanicswith evolution parameter $\tau$, off-shell electrodynamics constitutes adynamical theory of spacetime events, interacting through five $\tau$-dependentpre-Maxwell potentials. We present a straightforward solution of the classicalequations of motion, which is seen to be unsatisfactory, and reveals theessential difficulties in the formalism at the classical level. We then offer anew model of the particle current -- as a certain distribution of the eventcurrents on the worldline -- which eliminates these difficulties and permitscomparison of classical off-shell electrodynamics with the standard Maxwelltheory. In this model, the ``fixed'' event induces a Yukawa-type potential,permitting a semi-classical identification of the pre-Maxwell time scale$\lambda$ with the inverse mass of the intervening photon. Numerical solutionsto the equations of motion are compared with the standard Maxwell solutions,and are seen to coincide when $\lambda \gtrsim 10^{-6}$ seconds, providing aninitial estimate of this parameter. It is also demonstrated that the proposedmodel provides a natural interpretation for the photon mass cut-off requiredfor the renormalizability of the off-shell quantum electrodynamics.
