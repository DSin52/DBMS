M(atrix) theory compactified on an orbifold ${\bf T}_9/{\bf Z}_2$ is studied.Via zero-brane parton scattering we find that each of the $2^9 = 512$ orbifoldfixed points carry $-1/32$ units of zero-brane charge. The anomalous flux iscancelled by introducing a twisted sector consisting of 32 zero-branes that arespacetime supersymmetry singlets. These twisted sector zero-branes are nothingbut gravitational waves propagating along the M-theory direction. There is noD0-partons in the untwisted sector, a fact consistent with holographicprinciple. For low-energy excitations, the orbifold compactification isdescribed by ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group$SO(32)$.
