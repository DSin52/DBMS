We consider configurations of six-branes, five-branes and eight-branes invarious superstring backgrounds. These configurations give rise to $(0,1)$supersymmetric theories in six dimensions. The condition for RR chargeconservation of a brane configuration translates to the condition that thecorresponding field theory is anomaly-free. Sets of infinitely many models withnon-trivial RG fixed points at strong coupling are demonstrated. Some of themreproduce and generalise the world-volume theories of SO(32) and $E_8\timesE_8$ small instantons. All the models are shown to be connected by smoothtransitions. In particular, the small instanton transition for which a tensormultiplet is traded for 29 hypermultiplets is explicitly demonstrated. Theparticular limit in which these theories can be considered as six-dimensionalstring theories without gravity are discussed. New fixed points (stringtheories) associated with $E_n$ global symmetries are discovered by taking thestrong string coupling limit.
