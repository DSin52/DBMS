The three-dimensional topologies of the membrane of M-theory can beconstructed by performing Dehn surgery along knot lines. We investigatemembranes wrapped around a circle and the correponding subset of topologies(Seifert manifolds). The knot lines are interpreted as magnetic flux tubes inan XY model coupled to Maxwell theory. In this model the eleventh dimension ofM-theory gets ``eaten'' by the world-brane metric. There is argued to be asecond-order phase transition at a critical value of the string couplingconstant. The topology fluctuations that correspond to the knot lines areirrelevant in one phase while they condense in the other phase.
