We perform the perturbation analysis of the black holes in the 4D, N=4supergravity. Analysis around the black holes reveals a complicated mixingbetween the dilaton and other fields (metric and two U(1) Maxwell fields). Itturns out that considering both s-wave (l=0) and higher momentum modes (l \neq0), the dilaton as a fixed scalar is the only propagating mode with $P=Q,h_1=h_2=0$ and $F = -G = 2\phi$. We calculate the absorption cross-section forscattering of low frequency waves of fixed scalar and U(1) Maxwell fields offthe extremal black hole.
