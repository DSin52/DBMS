The Schwinger model, defined in the space interval $-L \le x \le L$, with(anti)periodic boundary conditions, is canonically quantized in the light-conegauge $A_-=0$ by means of equal-time (anti)commutation relations. Thetransformation diagonalizing the complete Hamiltonian is explicitlyconstructed, thereby giving spectrum, chiral anomaly and condensate. Thestructures of Hilbert spaces related both to free and to interactingHamiltonians are completely exhibited. Besides the usual massive field, twochiral massless fields are present, which can be consistently expunged from thephysical space by means of a subsidiary condition of a Gupta-Bleuler type. Thechiral condensate does provide the correct non-vanishing value in thedecompactification limit $L \to \infty$.
