Accurate and powerful computational methods developed by the author for thewave scattering by black holes allow to obtain the highly non trivial totalabsorption spectrum of the Black Hole. As well as partial wave phase shifts andcross sections (elastic and inelastic), the angular distribution of absorbedand scattered waves, and the Hawking emission rates. The exact total absorptionspectrum of waves by the Black Hole has as a function of frequency a remarkableoscillatory behaviour characteristic of a diffraction pattern. This is anunique distinctive feature of the black hole absorption, and due to its r = 0singularity. Ordinary absorptive bodies and optical models do not present thesefeatures. The unitarity optical theorem is generalized to the Black Hole caseexplicitly showing that absorption ocurrs only at the origin. All these resultsallow to understand and reproduce the Black Hole absorption spectrum in termsrays arriving at the origin through different optical paths. These fundamentalfeatures of the Black Hole Absorption will be present for generic higherdimensional Black Hole backgrounds, and whatever the low energy effectivetheory they arise from. In recent and increasing litterature devoted to computeabsorption cross sections (grey body factors) of black holes (whateverordinary, stringy, D-braned), the fundamental remarkable features of the BlackHole Absorption spectrum are overlooked.
