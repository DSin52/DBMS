We use an extension of the method due to Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina, andTyutin (BFFT) for transforming the nonlinear $\sigma$ model in a non-Abeliangauge theory. We deal with both supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric cases. Thebosonic case was already considered in literature but just gauged with anAbelian algebra. We show that the supersymmetric version is only compatiblewith a non-Abelian gauge theory. The usual BFFT method for this case leads to anonlocal algebra.
