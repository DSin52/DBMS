modified/added, ref. added; to appear in the Proceedings of the 31stInternational Symposium Ahrenshoop on the Theory of Elementary Particles,Buckow (Germany), September 2 - 6, 1997A four dimensional gauge theory with nonpolynomial but local interactions of1-form and 2-form gauge potentials is constructed. The model is a nontrivialdeformation of a free gauge theory with nonpolynomial dependence on thedeformation parameter (= gauge coupling constant).
