Authors: G.M. Cicuta

The study of the convergence of power series expansions of energy eigenvaluesfor anharmonic oscillators in quantum mechanics differs from generalunderstanding, in the case of quasi-exactly solvable potentials. They provideexamples of expansions with finite radius and suggest techniques useful toanalyze more generic potentials.
