We provide an explicit construction of 1/4 BPS states in four-dimensional N=4Super-Yang-Mills theory with a gauge group SU(3). These states correspond tothree-pronged strings connecting three D3-branes. We also find curves ofmarginal stability in the moduli space of the theory, at which the above statescan decay into two 1/2 BPS states.
