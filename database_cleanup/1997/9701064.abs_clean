The role of the conformal group in electrodynamics in four space-timedimensions is re-examined. As a pedagogic example we use the application ofconformal transformations to find the electromagnetic field for a chargedparticle moving with a constant relativistic acceleration from the Coulombelectric field for the particle at rest. We also re-consider the reformulationof Maxwell's equations on the projective cone, which is isomorphic to aconformal compactification on Minkowski space, so that conformaltransformations, belonging to the group O(4,2), are realised linearly. Theresulting equations are different from those postulated previously and respectadditional gauge invariances which play an essential role in ensuringconsistency with conventional electrodynamics on Minkowski space. The solutionon the projective cone corresponding to a constantly accelerating chargedparticle is discussed.
