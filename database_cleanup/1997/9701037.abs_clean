We propose a complete Born-Infeld-like action for a bosonic 5-brane with theworldvolume chiral field in a background of gravitational and antisymmetricgauge fields of D=11 supergravity. When the five-brane couples to a three-rankantisymmetric gauge field local worldvolume symmetries of the five-branerequire the addition to the action of an appropriate Wess-Zumino term. Topreserve general coordinate and Lorentz invariance of the model we introduce asingle auxiliary scalar field. The auxiliary field can be eliminated by gaugefixing a corresponding local symmetry at the price of the loss of manifest d=6worldvolume covariance. The double dimensional reduction of the five-branemodel results in the Born-Infeld action with the Wess-Zumino term for a D=10four-D-brane.
