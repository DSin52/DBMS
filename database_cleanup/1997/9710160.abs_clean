and a note erased. Talk delivered at the XVIII Encontro Nacional de Fisica deParticulas e Campos, 29th September 1997, Caxambu,MG,BrasilThe aim of this talk is to give a brief introduction to the problem ofconfinement in QCD and to N=2 globally supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theories(SYM). While avoiding technicalities as much as possible I will try toemphasize the physical ideas which lie behind the picture of confinement as aconsequence of the vacua of QCD to be a dual superconductor. Finally I reviewthe implementation of this picture in the framework of N=2 SYM.
