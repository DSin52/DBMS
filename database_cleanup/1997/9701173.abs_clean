A novel ansatz for solving the string equations of motion and constraints ingeneric curved backgrounds, namely the planetoid ansatz, was proposedrecently by some authors. We construct several specific examples of planetoidstrings in curved backgrounds which include Lorentzian wormholes, sphericalRindler spacetime and the 2+1 dimensional black hole. A semiclassicalquantisation is performed and the Regge relations for the planetoids areobtained. The general equations for the study of small perturbations aboutthese solutions are written down using the standard, manifestly covariantformalism. Applications to special cases such as those of planetoid strings inMinkowski and spherical Rindler spacetimes are also presented.
