The beta-function is calculated for an SU(N) Yang-Mills theory from an ansatzfor the vacuum wavefunctional. Direct comparison is made with the results ofcalculations of the beta-function of QCD. In both cases the theories areasymptotically free. The only difference being in the numerical coefficient ofthe beta-function, which is found to be -4 from the ansatz and -4+1/3 fromother QCD calculations. This is because, due to the constraint of Gauss' lawapplied to the wavefunctional, transverse gluons (which contribute the 1/3) areomitted. The renormalisation procedure is understood in terms of `tadpole' and`horse-shoe' Feynman diagrams which must be interpreted with a non-localpropagator.
