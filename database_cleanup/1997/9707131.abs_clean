We show how $N=4, D=4$ duality of Montonen and Olive can be derived for allgauge groups using geometric engineering in the context of type II strings,where it reduces to T-duality. The derivation for the non-simply laced casesinvolves the use of some well known facts about orbifold conformal theories.
