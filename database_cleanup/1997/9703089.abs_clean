The thermodynamic free energy F is calculated for a gas whose particles arethe quantum excitations of a piecewise uniform bosonic string. The stringconsists of two parts of length L_I and L_II, endowed with different tensionsand mass densities, adjusted in such a way that the velocity of sound alwaysequals the velocity of light. The explicit calculation is done under therestrictive condition that the tension ratio x = T_I/T_II approaches zero.Also, the length ratio s = L_II/L_I is assumed to be an integer. The expressionfor F is given on an integral form, in which s is present as a parameter. Forlarge values of s, the Hagedorn temperature becomes proportional to the squareroot of s.
