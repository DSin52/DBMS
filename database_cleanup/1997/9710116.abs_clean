We continue to study 5d N=1 supersymmetric field theories and theircompactifications on a circle through brane configurations. We develop a model,which we call (p,q) Webs, which enables simple geometrical computations toreproduce the known results, and facilitates further study. The physicalconcepts of field theory are transparent in this picture, offering aninterpretation for global symmetries, local symmetries, the effective (running)coupling, the Coulomb and Higgs branches, the monopole tensions, and the massof BPS particles. A rule for the dimension of the Coulomb branch is found byintroducing Grid Diagrams. Some known classifications of field theories arereproduced. In addition to the study of the vacuum manifold we develop methodsto determine the BPS spectrum. Some states, such as quarks, correspond toinstantons inside the 5-brane which we call strips. In general, these may notbe identified with (p,q) strings. We describe how a strip can bend out of a5-brane, becoming a string. A general BPS state corresponds to a Web of stringsand strips. For special values of the string coupling a few strips can combineand leave the 5-brane as a string.
