We review two types of D-branes processes where open strings are created. Inthe first type, a closed string incident on a collection of D-branes isconverted into a number of open strings running along them. For the case ofthreebranes we compare the leading absorption rate with that in semiclassicalgravity, and find exact agreement. A supersymmetric non-renormalization theoremguarantees that this agreement survives all corrections in powers of the stringcoupling times the number of branes. The second type of process is creation ofstretched open strings by crossing D-branes. We show that this is possiblewhenever a p-brane passes through an (8-p)-brane positioned orthogonally to it.The extra attractive force exerted by the stretched open string is crucial forfinding that the net force cancels in this BPS system.
