Title: A finite temperature generalization of Zamolodchikov's C-theorem

Comments: 22 pages, LaTeX

We prove a C-theorem within the framework of two dimensional quantum fieldtheories at finite temperature. There exists a function C(g) of couplingconstants which is non-increasing along renormalization group trajectories andnon-decreasing along temperature trajectory and stationary only at the fixedpoints. The connection between the C-theorem at zero temperature and theC-theorem at finite temperature is discussed. We also consider thethermodynamical aspects of the C-theorem. If we define the C-function in anarbitrary number of dimensions in anology to the two dimensional case, we canshow that its behavior is not universal. The phase transitions destroy themonotonic properties of the C-function. The proof of the C-theorem is alsopresented within the framework of the Kallen-Lehmann spectral representation atfinite temperature.
