In this article, applying different types of boundary conditions; Dirichlet,Neumann, or Mixed, on open strings we realize various new brane bound states instring theory. Calculating their interactions with other D-branes, we findtheir charge densities and their tension. A novel feature of $(p-2,p)$ branebound state is its "non-commutative" nature which is manifestly seen both inthe open strings mode expansions and in their scattering off a $D_p$-brane.Moreover we study three or more object bound states in string theory language.Finally we give a M-theoretic picture of these bound states.
