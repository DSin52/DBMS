University)Comments: 12 pages, plainTeX, no figures

Quantum Gravity admits topological excitations of microscopic scale which canmanifest themselves as particles --- topological geons. Non-trivial spatialtopology also brings into the theory free parameters analogous to the$\theta$-angle of QCD. We show that these parameters can be interpreted interms of geon properties. We also find that, for certain values of theparameters, the geons exhibit new patterns of particle identity together withnew types of statistics. Geon indistinguishability in such a case is expressedby a proper subgroup of the permutation group and geon statistics by a(possibly projective) representation of the subgroup.
