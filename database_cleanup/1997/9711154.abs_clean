We show in a model-independent way that, in the background of a topologicalsoliton or instanton that saturates a Bogomol'nyi bound, the fermion and bosonexcitation spectra of non-zero modes cancel at the one-loop level. Thisgeneralizes D'Adda and DiVecchia's result for some specific instanton models.Our method also establishes, again in a model-independent way, the generalityof the connection between zero modes in topologically non-trivial backgroundsand index theorems.
