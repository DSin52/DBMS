Conference on General Relativity and Relativistic AstrophysicsSystemsIn the talk, the relationship between black holes in Jackiw-Teitelboim(JT)dilaton gravity and solitons in sine-Gordon field theory is described. Thewell-known connection between solutions of the sine-Gordon equation andconstant curvature metrics is reviewed and expanded. In particular, it is shownthat solutions to the dilaton field equations for a given metric in JT theoryalso solve the sine-Gordon equation linearized about the corresponding soliton.Next, it is shown that from the B${\ddot a}$cklund transformations relatingdifferent soliton solutions, it is possible to construct a flat SL(2,R)connection which forms the basis for the gauge theory formulation of JT dilatongravity. Finally, the supersymmetric generalization of sine-Gordon theory isreviewed, leading to a new approach to the problem of the origin of lowdimensional black hole entropy.
