M(atrix) theory on an orbifold and classical two-branes therein are studiedwith particular emphasis to heterotic M(atrix) theory on $S_1/Z_2$ relevant tostrongly coupled heterotic and dual Type IA string theories. By analyzingorbifold condition on Chan-Paton factors, we show that three choice of gaugeBy examining area-preserving diffeomorphism that underlies the M(atrix) theory,we find that each choices of gauge group restricts possible topologies oftwo-branes. The result suggests that only the choice of SO(2N) or SO(2N+1)groups allows open two-branes, hence, relevant to heterotic M(atrix) theory. Weshow that requirement of both local vacuum energy cancellation and ofworldsheet anomaly cancellation of resulting heterotic string identifiessupersymmetric twisted sector spectra with sixteen fundamental representationspinors from each of the two fixed points. Twisted open and closed two-braneconfigurations are obtained in the large N limit.
