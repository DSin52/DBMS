We show that the boundary state description of a Dp-brane is strictly relatedto the corresponding classical solution of the low-energy string effectiveaction. By projecting the boundary state on the massless states of the closedstring we obtain the tension, the R-R charge and the large distance behavior ofthe classical solution. We discuss both the case of a single D-brane and thatof bound states of two D-branes. We also show that in the R-R sector theboundary state, written in a picture which treats asymmetrically the left andright components, directly yields the R-R gauge potentials.
