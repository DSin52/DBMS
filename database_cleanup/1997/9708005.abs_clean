We study how coincident Dirichlet 3-branes absorb incident gravitonspolarized along their world volume. We show that the absorption cross-sectionis determined by the central term in the correlator of two stress-energytensors. The existence of a non-renormalization theorem for this central chargein four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories shows that theleading term at low energies in the absorption cross-section is notrenormalized. This guarantees that the agreement of the cross-section withsemiclassical supergravity, found in earlier work, survives all loopcorrections. The connection between absorption of gravitons polarized along thebrane and Schwinger terms in the stress-energy correlators of the world volumetheory holds in general. We explore this connection to deduce some propertiesof the stress-energy tensor OPE's for 2-branes and 5-branes in 11 dimensions,as well as for 5-branes in 10 dimensions.
