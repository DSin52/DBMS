The behavior of the two-particle Green's function in QED is analyzed in thelimit when one of the particles becomes infinitely massive. It is found thatthe dependences of the Green's function on the relative times of the ingoingand outgoing particles factorize and that the bound state spectrum is the sameas that of the Dirac equation with the static potential created by the heavyparticle. The Bethe-Salpeter wave function is also determined in terms of theDirac wave function. The present result excludes the existence, in the abovelimit, of abnormal solutions due to relative time excitations as predicted bythe Bethe-Salpeter equation in the ladder approximation.
