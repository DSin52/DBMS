The origin of the string conformal anomaly is studied in detail. We use areformulated string Lagrangian which allows to consider the string tension$T_{0}$ as a small perturbation. The expansion parameter is the worldsheetspeed of light c, which is proportional to $T_{0}$ . We examine carefully theinterplay between a null (tensionless) string and a tensionful string whichincludes orders $ c^{2} $ and higher. The conformal algebra generated by theconstraints is considered. At the quantum level the normal ordering provides acentral charge proportional to $ c^{2} $. Thus it is clear that quantum nullstrings respect conformal invariance and it is the string tension whichgenerates the conformal anomaly.
