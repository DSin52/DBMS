We perform the dimensional reduction of the linear $\sigma$ model at one-looplevel. The effective potential of the reduced theory obtained from theintegration over the nonzero Matsubara frequencies is exhibited. Thermal massand coupling constant renormalization constants are given, as well as thethermal renormalization group equation which controls the dependence of thecounterterms on the temperature. We also recover, for the reduced theory, thevacuum unstability of the model for large N.
