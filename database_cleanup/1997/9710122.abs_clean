Title: M-theory and N=2 Strings

Authors: Emil Martinec

Comments: 29 pages, latex; lectures at the Cargese summer school Strings,

Branes, and Dualities, June 1997N=2 heterotic strings may provide a window into the physics of M-theoryradically different than that found via the other supersymmetric stringtheories. In addition to their supersymmetric structure, these strings carry afour-dimensional self-dual structure, and appear to be completely integrablesystems with a stringy density of states. These lectures give an overview ofN=2 heterotic strings, as well as a brief discussion of possible applicationsof both ordinary and heterotic N=2 strings to D-branes and matrix theory.
