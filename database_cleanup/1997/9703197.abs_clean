We discuss the introduction of soft breaking terms into the exact solutionsof N=1 SQCD using a spurion analysis. The spurion symmetries are not sufficientto determine the behavior of models in which squark or gaugino masses alone areintroduced. However, a controlled approximation is obtained in some cases if asupersymmetric mass is first introduced for the matter fields. We presentlow-energy solutions for two models with perturbing soft breaking terms, onewith a gaugino mass and one with squark mixing. These models have non-trivialtheta angle dependence and exhibit phase transitions at non-zero theta angleanalogous to those found in the chiral Lagrangian description of QCD.
