BRST quantization is carried out for a model of p-branes with second classconstraints. After extension of the phase space the constraint algebracoincides with the one of null string when p=1. It is shown that in this caseone can or can not obtain critical dimension for the null string, depending onthe choice of the operator ordering and corresponding vacuum states. When p>1,operator orderings leading to critical dimension in the p=1 case are notallowed. Admissable orderings give no restrictions on the dimension of theembedding space-time. Finally, a generalization to supersymmetric null branesis proposed.
