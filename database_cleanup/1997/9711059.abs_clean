We construct the complete coupling of $(1,0)$ supergravity in six dimensionsto $n$ tensor multiplets, extending previous results to all orders in the fermifields. We then add couplings to vector multiplets, as dictated by thegeneralized Green-Schwarz mechanism. The resulting theory embodies factorizedgauge and supersymmetry anomalies, to be disposed of by fermion loops, and isdetermined by corresponding Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, aside from aquartic coupling for the gaugini. The supersymmetry algebra contains acorresponding extension that plays a crucial role for the consistency of theconstruction. We leave aside gravitational and mixed anomalies, that would onlycontribute to higher-derivative couplings.
