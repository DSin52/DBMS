In this letter we propose to use an extension of the variational approachknown as Truncated Conformal Space to compute numerically the VacuumExpectation Values of the operators of a conformal field theory perturbed by arelevant operator. As an example we estimate the VEV's of all (UV regular)primary operators of the Ising model and of some of the Tricritical Ising Modelconformal field theories when perturbed by any choice of the relevant primaryoperators. We compare our results with some other independent predictions.
