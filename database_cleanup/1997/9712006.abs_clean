We find the microscopic spectral densities and the spectral correlatorsassociated with multicritical behavior for both hermitian and complex matrixensembles, and show their universality. We conjecture that microscopic spectraldensities of Dirac operators in certain theories without spontaneous chiralsymmetry breaking may belong to these new universality classes.
