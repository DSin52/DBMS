Magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with a non-abelian unbrokengauge group are classified by holomorphic charges in addition to thetopological charges familiar from the abelian case. As a result the modulispaces of monopoles of given topological charge are stratified according to theholomorphic charges. Here the physical consequences of the stratification areexplored in the case where the gauge group SU(3) is broken to U(2). Thedescription due to A. Dancer of the moduli space of charge two monopoles isreviewed and interpreted physically in terms of non-abelian magnetic dipolemoments. Semi-classical quantisation leads to dyonic states which are labelledby a magnetic charge and a representation of the subgroup of U(2) which leavesthe magnetic charge invariant (centraliser subgroup). A key result of thispaper is that these states fall into representations of the semi-direct product$U(2) \semidir R^4$. The combination rules (Clebsch-Gordan coefficients) ofdyonic states can thus be deduced. Electric-magnetic duality properties of thetheory are discussed in the light of our results, and supersymmetric dyonic BPSstates which fill the SL(2,Z)-orbit of the basic massive W-bosons are found.
