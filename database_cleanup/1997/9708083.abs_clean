The finite N version of Matrix theory describes M-theory and superstrings inso-called discretized light cone quantization (DLCQ). Its role has beenexplained for M-theory in 11 dimensions and for type IIA theory. We shownovelties which arise by generalizing the ideas to heterotic strings. Thestates which arise in O(N) theories with odd N we interpret as fields which areantiperiodic in the longitudinal direction. Consistency of these ideas providesa new evidence for the conjecture that finite N models describe sectors with agiven longitudinal momentum.
