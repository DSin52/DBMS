We describe the deformed covariant phase space corresponding to the so-calledkappa-deformation of D=4 relativistic symmetries, with quantum ``time''coordinate and Heisenberg algebra obtained according to the Heisenberg doubleconstruction. The associated modified uncertainty relations are analyzed, andin particular it is shown that these relations are consistent with independentestimates of quantum-gravity limitations on the measurability of space-timedistances.
