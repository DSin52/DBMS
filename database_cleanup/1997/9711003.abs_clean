$D$ dimensional neutral black strings wrapped on a circle are related to$(D-1)$ dimensional charged black holes by boosts. We show that the boost hasto be performed in the covering space and the boosted coordinate has to becompactified on a circle with a Lorentz contracted radius. Using this fact weshow that the transition between Schwarzschild black holes to black p-branesobserved recently in M theory is the well-known black hole- black stringtransition viewed in a boosted frame. In a similar way the correspondence pointwhere an excited string state goes over to a neutral black hole is mappedexactly to the correspondence point for black p-branes. In terms of the $p$brane quantities the equation of state for an excited string state becomesidentical to that of a 3+1 dimensional massless gas for all $p$. Finally, weshow how boosts can be used to relate Hawking radiation rates. Using the knownmicroscopic derivation of absorption by extremal 3-branes and near-extremal 5Dholes with three large charges we provide a microscopic derivation ofabsorption of 0-branes by seven and five dimensional Schwarzschild black holesin a certain regime.
