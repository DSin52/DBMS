We study the symmetry structure of N=8 quantum mechanics, and apply it tothe physics of D0-brane probes in type I' string theory. We focus on the theorywith a global $Spin(8)$ R symmetry which arises upon dimensional reduction from$2d$ field theory with $(0,8)$ supersymmetry. There are several puzzlesinvolving supersymmetry which we resolve. In particular, by taking into accountthe gauge constraint and central charge we explain how the system preservessupersymmetry despite having different numbers of bosonic and fermionicvariables. The resulting zero-point energy leads to a linear potentialconsistent with supersymmetry, and the metric is largely unconstrained. Wediscuss implications for type I' string theory and the matrix model proposalfor M theory.
