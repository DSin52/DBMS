Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold with smooth boundary. We study thevacuum expectation value of an operator Q by studying Tr Qe^{-tD}, where D isan operator of Laplace type on M, and where Q is a second order operator withscalar leading symbol; we impose Dirichlet or modified Neumann boundaryconditions.
