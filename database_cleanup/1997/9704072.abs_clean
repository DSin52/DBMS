Title: Absence of Radiation Reaction for an Extended Particle in Classical

ElectrodynamicsComments: 5 pages, LATEX

There are known problems with the standard Lorentz-Dirac description ofradiation reaction in classical electrodynamics. The model of extended in onedimension particle is proposed and is shown that for this model there is nototal change in particle momentum due to radiation reaction
