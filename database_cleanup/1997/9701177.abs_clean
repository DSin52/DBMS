We address the issue of T-duality and U-duality symmetries in thetoroidally-compactified type IIA string. It is customary to take as a startingpoint the dimensionally-reduced maximal supergravity theories, with certainfield strengths dualised such that the classical theory exhibits a global$E_{n(n)}$ symmetry, where n=11-D in D dimensions. A discrete subgroup thenbecomes the conjectured U-duality group. In dimensions D\le 6, these necessarydualisations include NS-NS fields, whose potentials, rather than merely theirfield strengths, appear explicitly in the couplings to the string worldsheet.Thus the usually-stated U-duality symmetries act non-locally on the fundamentalfields of perturbative string theory. At least at the perturbative level, itseems to be more appropriate to consider the symmetries of the versions of thelower-dimensional supergravities in which no dualisations of NS-NS fields arerequired, although dualisations of the R-R fields are permissible since thesecouple to the string through their field strengths. Taking this viewpoint, theusual T-duality groups survive unscathed, as one would hope since T-duality isa perturbative symmetry, but the U-duality groups are modified in D\le 6.
