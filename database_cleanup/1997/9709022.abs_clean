We compute spectra of particles produced during a dilaton-driven kineticinflation phase within string cosmology models. The resulting spectra depend onthe parameters of the model and on the type of particle and are quite varied,some increasing and some decreasing with frequency. We use an approximationscheme in which all spectra can be expressed in a nice symmetric form, perhapshinting at a deeper symmetry of the underlying physics. Our results may serveas a starting point for detailed studies of relic abundances, dark mattercandidates, and possible sources of large scale anisotropy.
