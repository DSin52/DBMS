Title: Seiberg-Witten Theory, Integrable Systems and D-branes

Authors: A.Marshakov

Comments: LaTeX, 11pp, 3 figs in tex-format requiring emlines2.sty; Based on

the talks given at NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Theoretical Physics"New Developments in Quantum Field Theory", Zakopane, 14-20 June 1997 and IVInternational Conference "Conformal Field Theories and Integrable Models",Chernogolovka, 23-27 June 1997In this note it is demonstrated how the Seiberg-Witten solutions and relatedintegrable systems may arise from certain brane configurations in M-theory.Some subtleties of the formulation of the Seiberg-Witten theory via integrablesystems are discussed and interpreted along the lines of general picture ofstring/M-theory dualities.
