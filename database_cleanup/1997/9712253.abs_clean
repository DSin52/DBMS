A review of recent progress in string theory concerning the Bekensteinformula for black hole entropy is given. Topics discussed include p-branes,D-branes and supersymmetry; the correspondence principle; the D- and M-braneapproach to black hole entropy; the D-brane analogue of Hawking radiation, andinformation loss; D-branes as probes of black holes; and the Matrix theoryapproach to charged and neutral black holes. Some introductory material isincluded.
