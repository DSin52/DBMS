As a step toward satisfactory understanding of the quantum dynamics ofDirichlet \break (D-) particles, the amplitude for the basic process describingthe scattering of two quantized D-particles is computed in bosonic stringtheory. The calucluation is performed and cross-checked using three differentmethods, namely, (i) path integral, (ii) boundary state, and (iii) open-channeloperator formalism. The analysis is exact in $\al'$ and includes the firstorder correction in the expansion with respect to the acceleration of theD-particles. The resultant Lorentz-invariant amplitude is capable of describinggeneral non-forward scattering with recoil effects fully taken into account andit reproduces the known result for the special case of forward scattering inthe limit of infinitely large D-particle mass. The expected form of theamplitude for the supersymmetric case is also briefly discussed.
