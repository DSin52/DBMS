We are studying finite fermion density states in Maxwell QED$_{2+1}$ withexternal magnetic field. It is shown that at any fermion density the energy ofsome magnetized states may be less than that of the state with the samedensity, but no magnetic field. Magnetized states are described by theeffective Maxwell-Chern-Simons QED$_{2+1}$ Lagrangian with gauge field massproportional to the number of filled Landau levels.
