Title: Generalized Dynkin diagrams and root systems and their folding

Authors: Jean-Bernard Zuber

Comments: plain tex, 7 figures

Graphs which generalize the simple or affine Dynkin diagrams are introduced.Each diagram defines a bilinear form on a root system and thus a reflectiongroup. We present some properties of these groups and of their natural "Coxeterelement". The folding of these graphs and groups is also discussed, using thetheory of C-algebras.
