We consider a uniaxial planar ferromagnet coupled minimally to an AbelianChern-Simons gauge field and study self-dual solitons which saturate theBogomol'nyi bound. We find a rich structure of rotationally symmetric staticsoliton solutions for various uniform background charge densities. For a givenferromagnet material, the properties of these solitons are controlled only bythe external magnetic field and the background charge.
