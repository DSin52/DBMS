Title: Application of Microlocal Analysis to the Theory of Quantum Fields

Interacting with a Gravitational FieldAuthors: Wolfgang Junker

Comments: 7 pages, Latex, talk presented at the Conference on Partial

Differential Equations, Potsdam 1996It is explained how techniques from microlocal analysis can be used to settlesome long-standing questions that arise in the study of the interaction ofquantum matter fields with a classical gravitational background field.
