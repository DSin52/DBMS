In the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, Feynman and Hibbsnoted that the trajectory of a particle is continuous but nowheredifferentiable. We extend this result to the quantum mechanical path of arelativistic string and find that the ``trajectory'', in this case, is afractal surface with Hausdorff dimension three. Depending on the resolution ofthe detecting apparatus, the extra dimension is perceived as ``fuzziness'' ofthe string world-surface. We give an interpretation of this phenomenon in termsof a new form of the uncertainty principle for strings, and study thetransition from the smooth to the fractal phase.
