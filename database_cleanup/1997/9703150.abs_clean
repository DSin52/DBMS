An inhomogeneous version of pre--Big Bang cosmology emerges, within stringtheory, from quite generic initial conditions, provided they lie deeply insidethe weak-coupling, low-curvature regime. Large-scale homogeneity, flatness, andisotropy appear naturally as late-time outcomes of such an evolution.
