Title: Singularities of massless planar diagrams, large-N_c mesons in 3+1

dimensions, and the 't Hooft modelComments: 17 pages of Latex, 5 pages of figures

We study the singular Landau surfaces of planar diagrams contributing toscattering of a massless quark and antiquark in 3+1 dimensions. In particular,we look at singularities which remain after integration with respect to thevarious angular degrees of freedom. We derive a general relation between thesesingularities and the singularities of quark- antiquark scattering in 1+1dimensions. We then classify all Landau surfaces of the 1+1 dimensional system.Combining these results, we deduce that the singular surfaces of the angle-integrated 3+1 dimensional amplitude must satisfy at least one of threeconditions, which we call the planar light-cone conditions. We discuss theextension of our results to non-perturbative processes by means of thenon-perturbative operator product expansion. Our findings offer new insightsinto the connection between the 't Hooft model and large-N_c mesons in 3+1dimensions and may prove useful in studies of confinement in relativistic mesonsystems.
