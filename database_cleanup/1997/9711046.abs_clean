We evaluate one-loop finite-time amplitudes for graviton scattering in Matrixtheory and compare to the corresponding amplitudes in supergravity. We findagreement for arbitrary time intervals at leading order in distance, providinga functional agreement between supergravity and Matrix theory. At subleadingorder, we find corrections to the effective potential found from previous phaseshift calculations in Matrix theory.
