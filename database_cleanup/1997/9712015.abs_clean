The reduction of 4D Einstein gravity with $N$ minimal scalars leads tospecific 2D dilaton gravity with dilaton coupled scalars. Applying s-wave andlarge $N$ approximation (where large $N$ quantum contribution due to dilatonitself is taken into account) we study 2D cosmology for CGHS model and forreduced Einstein gravity (in both cases with dilaton coupled scalars).Numerical study shows that in most cases we get 2D singular Universe which maycorrespond to big bang. Nevertheless, big crunch or non-singular Universes arealso possible. For reduced 4D Einstein gravity one can regard the obtained 2Dcosmology with time-dependent dilaton as 4D Kantowski-Sacks Universe ofsingular,non-singular or big crunch type.
