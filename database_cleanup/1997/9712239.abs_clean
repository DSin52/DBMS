We examine the boundary conditions associated with extended supersymmetricMaxwell theory in 5-dimensional anti-De Sitter space. Excitations on theboundary are identical to those of ordinary 4-dimensional conformal invariantsuper electrodynammics. Extrapolations of these excitations give rise to a5-dimensional topological gauge theory of the singleton type. The possibilityof a connection of this phenomenon to the world volume theory of 3-branes inIIB string theory is discussed.
