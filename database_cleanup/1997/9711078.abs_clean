We consider membranes of spherical topology in uncompactified Matrix theory.In general for large membranes Matrix theory reproduces the classical membranedynamics up to 1/N corrections; for certain simple membrane configurations, theequations of motion agree exactly at finite N. We derive a general formula forthe one-loop Matrix potential between two finite-sized objects at largeseparations. Applied to a graviton interacting with a round spherical membrane,we show that the Matrix potential agrees with the naive supergravity potentialfor large N, but differs at subleading orders in N. The result is quitethe effects of gravitational radiation, the one-loop potential betweenclassical Matrix configurations agrees with the long-distance potentialexpected from supergravity. As a spherical membrane shrinks, it eventuallybecomes a black hole. This provides a natural framework to study Schwarzschildblack holes in Matrix theory.
