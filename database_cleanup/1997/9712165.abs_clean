We derive the embedding structure of unitary N=2 minimal models and show as aresult that these representations have a degeneration of uncharged singularstates. This corrects some earlier mistakes made in the literature. We discussthe connexion to the N=2 character formulae and finally give a proof for theembedding diagrams.
