ghost and fermion fieldsAuthors: Thomas Schmitt

Comments: 28 pages, AmsLaTeX 1.2

Using a supergeometric interpretation of field functionals, we show that fora class of classical field models used for realistic quantum field theoreticmodels, an infinite-dimensional supermanifold (smf) of classical solutions inMinkowski space can be constructed. That is, we show that the smf of smoothCauchy data with compact support is isomorphic with an smf of correspondingclassical solutions of the model.
