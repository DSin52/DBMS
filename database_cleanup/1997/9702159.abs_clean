We study the critical behavior in the black p-branes and four dimensionalcharged dilaton black holes. We calculate the thermodynamic fluctuations in thevarious (microcanonical, canonical, and grandcanonical) ensembles. It is foundthat the extremal limit of some black configurations has a critical point and aphase transition takes place from the extremal to nonextremal blackconfigurations. Some critical exponents are obtained, which satisfy the scalinglaws. This is related to the fact that the entropy of these blackconfigurations is a homogeneous function.
