We speculate that above or just below the electroweak phase transitionmagnetic fields are generated which have a net helicity (otherwise said, aChern-Simons term) of order of magnitude $N_B + N_L$, where $N_{B,L}$ is thebaryon or lepton number today. (To be more precise requires much more knowledgeof B,L-generating mechanisms than we currently have.) Electromagnetic helicitygeneration is associated (indirectly) with the generation of electroweakChern-Simons number through B+L anomalies. This helicity, which in the earlyuniverse is some 30 orders of magnitude greater than what would be expectedfrom fluctuations alone in the absence of B+L violation, should be reasonablywell-conserved through the evolution of the universe to around the times ofmatter dominance and decoupling, because the early universe is an excellentconductor. Possible consequences include early structure formation; macroscopicmanifestations of CP violation in the cosmic magnetic field (measurable atleast in principle, if not in practice); and an inverse-cascade dynamomechanism in which magnetic fields and helicity are unstable to transfer tolarger and larger spatial scales. We give a quasi-linear treatment of thegeneral-relativistic MHD inverse cascade instability, finding substantialgrowth for helicity of the assumed magnitude out to scales $\siml_M\epsilon^{-1}$, where $\epsilon$ is roughly the B+L to photon ratio and$l_M$ is the magnetic correlation length. We also elaborate further on anearlier proposal of the author for generation of magnetic fields above the EWphase transition.
