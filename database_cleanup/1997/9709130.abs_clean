Title: On the higher-loop effective action in NJL model

Comments: 13 pages, LATEX

The 3-loop effective action and effective potential in Nambu - Jona-Lasiniomodel are calculated. The problem of vanishing contributions in the higherorders is discussed. The general form of such contributions is obtained.
