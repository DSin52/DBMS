We investigate a lattice version of QED by numerical simulations. For therenormalized charge and mass we find results which are consistent with therenormalized charge vanishing in the continuum limit. A detailed study of therelation between bare and renormalized quantities reveals that the Landau polelies in a region of parameter space which is made inaccessible by spontaneouschiral symmetry breaking.
