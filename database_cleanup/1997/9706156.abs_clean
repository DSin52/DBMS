In this letter, we provide evidence for a classical sector of states in theHilbert space of Finite Quantum Mechanics (FQM). We construct a subset ofstates whose the minimum bound of position -momentum uncertainty (equivalent toan effective $\hbar$) vanishes. The classical regime, contrary to standardQuantum Mechanical Systems of particles and fields, but also of strings andbranes appears in short distances of the order of the lattice spacing. {}Forlinear quantum maps of long periods, we observe that time evolution leads tofast decorrelation of the wave packets, phenomenon similar to the behavior ofwave packets in t' Hooft and Susskind holographic picture. Moreoever, weconstruct explicitly a non - dispersive basis of states in accordance with t'Hooft's arguments about the deterministic behavior of FQM.
