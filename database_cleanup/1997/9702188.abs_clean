We discuss how concepts such as geodesic length and the volume of space-timecan appear in 2d topological gravity. We then construct a detailed mappingbetween the reduced Hermitian matrix model and 2d topological gravity at genuszero. This leads to a complete solution of the counting problem for planargraphs with vertices of even coordination number. The connection betweenmulti-critical matrix models and multi-critical topological gravity at genuszero is studied in some detail.
