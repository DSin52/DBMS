We investigate the properties of a class of near-extreme static black holesolutions called naked black holes. These black holes, which occur in stringtheory, have small curvature invariants but large tidal forces outside theirevent horizons. We show that these large tidal forces are due to aconcentration of dilaton stress-energy near the horizon. We study infallingtest strings and find that they are highly excited by the large tidal forces,but remain small. Perhaps most importantly, it turns out that a small amount ofinfalling matter will cause the curvature invariants to become large outsidethe horizon. Nevertheless, an exact calculation shows that both the mattertrajectories and the classical black hole background are not significantlyaltered.
