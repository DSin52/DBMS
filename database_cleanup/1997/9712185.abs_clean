We show that the linearized supergravity potential between two objectsarising from the exchange of quanta with zero longitudinal momentum isreproduced to all orders in 1/r by terms in the one-loop Matrix theorypotential. The essential ingredient in the proof is the identification of theMatrix theory quantities corresponding to moments of the stress tensor andmembrane current. We also point out that finite-N Matrix theory violates theequivalence principle.
