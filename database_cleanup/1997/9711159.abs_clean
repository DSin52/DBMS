We calculate a temperature dependent part of the one-loop thermodynamicpotential (and the free energy) for charged massive fields in a general classof irreducible rank 1 symmetric spaces. Both low- and high-temperatureexpansions are derived and the role of non-trivial topology influence onasymptotic properties of the potential is discussed.
