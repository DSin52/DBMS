We compute the amplitude for the radiation of massless NS-NS closed stringstates from the interaction of two moving D-branes. We consider particle-likeD-branes with reference to 4-dimensional spacetime, in toroidal and orbifoldcompactifications, and we work out the relevant world sheet propagators withinthe moving boundary state formalism. We find no on-shell axion emission. Forlarge inter-brane separation, we compute the spacetime graviton emissionamplitude and estimate the average energy radiated, whereas the spacetimedilaton amplitude is found to vanish in this limit. The possibility of emissionof other massless states depends on the nature of the branes and of thecompactification scheme.
