Basic features of the conservation laws in the Hamiltonian approach to thePoincar\'e gauge theory are presented. It is shown that the Hamiltonian isgiven as a linear combination of ten first class constraints. The Poissonbracket algebra of these constraints is used to construct the gauge generators.By assuming that the asymptotic symmetry is the global Poincar\'e symmetry, wederived the improved form of the asymptotic generators, and discussed therelated conservation laws of energy, momentum, etc.
