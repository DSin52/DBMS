Starting with topological field theory, we derive space-time uncertaintyrelation proposed by Yoneya through breakdown of topological symmetry in thelarge $N$ matrix model. Next, on the basis of only two basic principles, thoseare, generalized space-time uncertainty principle containing spinor field andtopological symmetry, we construct a new matrix model. If we furthermore imposea requirement of N=2 supersymmetry, this new matrix model exactly reduces tothe IKKT model or the Yoneya model for IIB superstring depending on anappropriate choice for a scalar function. A key feature of these formulationsis an appearance of the nontrivial "dynamical" theory through breakdown oftopological symmetry in the matrix model. It is closely examined why thenontrivial "dynamical" theory appears from the trivial topological fieldtheory.
