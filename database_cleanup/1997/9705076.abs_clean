Fields'' briefly introducing dualities in four-dimensional quantum fieldtheory, and summarizing results found in supersymmetric field theories. Thefirst lecture describes physical aspects of electric-magnetic (EM), strong-weakcoupling (S), and infrared (IR) dualities. The second lecture focuses onresults and conjectures concerning S-duality in N=2 supersymmetric gaugetheories. The third lecture discusses IR-dualities and their relation toS-duality in N=1 supersymmetric field theories.
