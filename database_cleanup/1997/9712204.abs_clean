Title: Quantum properties of general gauge theories with composite and external

fieldsAuthors: S. Falkenberg, B. Geyer, and P. Moshin

Comments: 24 pages, LATEX, slightly changed to clarify the essential new aspect

concerning composite fields depending on external ones; added formulasshowing lack of (generalized) nilpotence of operators appearing in the WardidentitiesJournal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys. A14 (1999) 3847-3870

The generating functionals of Green's functions with composite and externalfields are considered in the framework of BV and BLT quantization methods forgeneral gauge theories. The corresponding Ward identities are derived and thegauge dependence is investigated
