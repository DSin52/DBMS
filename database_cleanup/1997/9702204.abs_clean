In an abelian gauge theory, the Coulombic potential between two staticcharges is obtained most directly when a correct separation betweengauge-invariant and gauge degrees of freedom is made. This motivates a similarseparation in the nonabelian theory. When a careful identification of theHilbert space is made, along with the proper analyticity requirements, it isthen possible to find the appropriate wavefunctionals describing heavy colorsources in the theory. This treatment is consistent with, and realizes in asimple way the center symmetry Z_N of SU(N) gauge theories.
