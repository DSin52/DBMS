We consider a one-brane probe in the presence of a five-dimensional blackhole in the classical limit. The velocity-dependent force on a slowly-movingprobe is characterized by a metric on the probe moduli space. This metric iscomputed for large black holes using low-energy supergravity, and for smallblack holes using D-brane gauge theory. The results are compared.
