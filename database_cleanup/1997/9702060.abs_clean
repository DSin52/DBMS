Title: Bv Gauge Theories

Comments: 10 pages, Latex

Using the Non-Abelian Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism introduced recently, wepresent a generalization of the Yang-Mills gauge transformations , to includeantisymmetric tensor fields as gauge bosons. The Freedman-Townsendtransformation for the two-form gauge field is automatically recovered. Newcharacteristic classes involving this two-form field and the Yang-Millsone-form field are derived. We also show how to include, in an unified way, agauge invariant coupling of the new gauge bosons to fermionic and bosonicmatter.
