The long-range, spin-dependent forces between D0-branes are related tolong-range fundamental string interactions using duality. These interactionscan then be computed by taking the long distance non-relativistic expansion ofstring four-point amplitudes. The results are in accord with the generalconstraints of Matrix Theory.
