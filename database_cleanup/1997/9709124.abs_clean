Title: String Solitons and Black Hole Thermodynamics

Comments: 8 pages, latex

Journal-ref: Proc. 19th MRST Meeting, Syracuse, 1997 p.44-51

We discuss the role of string solitons in duality and examine the feature ofcompositeness, which allows for the interpretation of general solutions asbound states of supersymmetric fundamental constituents. This feature lies atthe heart of the recent success of string theory in reproducing theBekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy formula. Talk given at 19th annual MRSTmeeting, Syracuse, NY, May 12-13, 1997.
