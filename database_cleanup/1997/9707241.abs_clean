A natural SL(2,Z) invariant generalization of the Veneziano amplitude in typeIIB superstring theory is investigated. It includes certain perturbative andnon-perturbative (D-instanton) contributions, and it reduces to the correctexpressions in different limits. The singularities are poles in the $s$-$t$-$u$channels, corresponding to the exchange of particles with a mass spectrumcoinciding with that of $(p,q)$ string states. We describe the generalstructure of the associated perturbative corrections to the effective action.
