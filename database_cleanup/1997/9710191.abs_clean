A Lorentz covariant quantization of membrane dynamics is defined, which alsoleaves unbroken the full three dimensional diffeomorphism invariance of themembrane. Among the applications studied are the reduction to string theory,which may be understood in terms of the phase space and constraints, and theinterpretation of physical,zero-energy states. A matrix regularization isdefined as in the light cone gauged fixed theory but there are difficultiesimplementing all the gauge symmetries. The problem involves thenon-area-preserving diffeomorphisms which are realized non-linearly in theclassical theory. In the quantum theory they do not seem to have a consistentimplementation for finite N. Finally, an approach to a genuinely backgroundindependent formulation of matrix dynamics is briefly described.
