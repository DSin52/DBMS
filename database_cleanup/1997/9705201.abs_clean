Title: The topology of multi-coupling deformations of CFT

Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX

We discuss the topological properties of the manifold of coupling constantsfor multi-coupling deformations of conformal field theories. We calculate theEuler and Betti numbers and briefly discuss physical applications of theseresults.
