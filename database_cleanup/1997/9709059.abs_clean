229-247A model of a relativistic particle moving in the Liouville field isinvestigated. Symmetry group of the system is $SL(2,R)/Z_2$. The correspondingdynamical integrals describe full set of classical trajectories. Dynamicalintegrals are used for the gauge-invariant Hamiltonian reduction. The newscheme is proposed for quantization of the reduced system. Obtained quantumsystem reproduces classical symmetry. Physical aspects of the model arediscussed.
