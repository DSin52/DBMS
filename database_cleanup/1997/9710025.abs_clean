Starting from a relativistic quantum field theory, we study the low energyscattering of two fermions of opposite spins interacting through a Chern-Simonsfield. Using the Coulomb gauge we implement the one loop renormalizationprogram and discuss vacuum polarization and magnetic moment effects. We provethat the induced magnetic moments for spin up and spin down fermions are thesame. Next, using an intermediary auxiliary cutoff the scattering amplitude iscomputed up to one loop. Similarly to Aharonov-Bohm effect for spin zeroparticles, the low energy part of the amplitude contains a logarithmicdivergence in the limit of very high intermediary cutoff. In our approachhowever the needed counterterm is automatically provided without any additionalhypothesis.
