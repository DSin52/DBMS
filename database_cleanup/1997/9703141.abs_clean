We consider new objects in bosonic open string theory -- ND tadpoles, whichhave N(euman) boundary conditions at one end of the world-sheet and D(irichlet)at the other, must exist due to s-t duality in a string theory with both NNstrings and D-branes. We demonstrate how to interpolate between N and Dboundary conditions. In the case of mixed boundary conditions the action for aquantum particle is induced on the boundary. Quantum-mechanical particle-waveduality, a dual description of a quantum particle in either the coordinate orthe momentum representation, is induced by world-sheet T-duality. The famousrelation between compactification radii is equivalent to the quantization ofthe phase space area of a Planck cell. We also introduce a boundary operator -a ``Zipper'' which changes the boundary condition from N into D and vice versa.
