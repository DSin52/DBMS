Motivated by recent developments in string theory, we study the structure ofboundary conditions in arbitrary conformal field theories. A boundary conditioncoefficients for bulk fields on the disk; and second, a choice of anautomorphism $\omega$ of the fusion rules that preserves conformal weights.Non-trivial automorphisms $\omega$ correspond to D-brane configurations forarbitrary conformal field theories. The choice of the fusion rule automorphism$\omega$ amounts to fixing the dimension and certain global topologicalfeatures of the D-brane world volume and the background gauge field on it. Wepresent evidence that for fixed choice of $\omega$ the boundary conditions areclassified as the irreducible representations of some commutative associativealgebra, a generalization of the fusion rule algebra. Each of these irreduciblerepresentations corresponds to a choice of the moduli for the world volume ofthe D-brane and the moduli of the flat connection on it.
