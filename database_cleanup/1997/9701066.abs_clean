Integrable SystemsWe consider gapless models of statistical mechanics. At zero temperaturescorrelation functions decay asymptotically as powers of distance in thesemodels. Temperature correlations decay exponentially. We used an example ofsolvable model to find the formula, which describes long distance and largetime asymptotic of correlation function of local fields. The formula describescorrelation at any temperature and arbitrary coupling constant.
