Title: Dual Symmetry in Gauge Theories

Comments: 18 pages

Continuous dual symmetry in electrodynamics, Yang-Mills theory andgravitation is investigated. Dual invariant which leads to badly nonlinearmotion equations is chosen as a Lagrangian of the pure classical dual nonlinearelectrodynamics. In a natural manner some dual angle which is determined by theelectromagnetic strengths at the point of the time-space appears in the model.Motion equations may well be interpreted as the equations of the standardMaxwell theory with source. Alternative interpretation is the quasi-Maxwelllinear theory with magnetic charge. Analogous approach is possible in theYang-Mills theory. In this case the dual-invariant non-Abelian theory motionequations possess the same instanton solutions as the conventional Yang--Millsequations have. An Abelian two-parameter dual group is found to exist intensor was expanded into the sum of twice anti-self-dual and self-dual parts.Gravitational instantons are defined as (real) solutions to the usual dualityequations. Central-symmetry solutions to these equations are obtained. Thetwice anti-self-dual part of the curvature tensor may be used for introductionof new gravitational equations generalizing Einstein's equations. However, thetheory obtained reduces to the conformal-flat Nordstrom theory.
