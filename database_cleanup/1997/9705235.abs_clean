The dimensional properties of fields in classical general relativity lead toa tangent tower structure which gives rise directly to quantum mechanical andquantum field theory structures without quantization. We derive all of thefundamental elements of quantum mechanics from the tangent tower structure,including fundamental commutation relations, a Hilbert space of pure and mixedstates, measurable expectation values, Schroedinger time evolution, collapse ofa state and the probability interpretation. The most central elements of stringtheory also follow, including an operator valued mode expansion like that instring theory as well as the Virasoro algebra with central charges.
