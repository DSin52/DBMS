Two closely related topological phenomena are studied at finite density andtemperature. These are chiral anomaly and Chern-Simons term. By using differentmethods it is shown that $\mu^2 = m^2$ is the crucial point for Chern-Simons atzero temperature. So when $\mu^2 < m^2$ $\mu$--influence disappears and we getthe usual Chern-Simons term. On the other hand when $\mu^2 > m^2$ theChern-Simons term vanishes because of non-zero density of background fermions.It is occurs that the chiral anomaly doesn't depend on density and temperature.The connection between parity anomalous Chern-Simons and chiral anomaly isgeneralized on finite density. These results hold in any dimension as inabelian, so as in nonabelian cases.
