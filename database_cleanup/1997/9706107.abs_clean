The structure of spacetime duality and discrete worldsheet symmetries ofcompactified string theory is examined within the framework of noncommutativegeometry. The full noncommutative string spacetime is constructed using theFrohlich-Gawedzki spectral triple which incorporates the vertex operatoralgebra of the string theory. The duality group appears naturally as a subgroupof the automorphism group of the vertex operator algebra and spacetime dualityis shown to arise as the possibility of associating two independent Diracoperators, arising from the chiral structure of the worldsheet theory, to thenoncommutative geometry.
