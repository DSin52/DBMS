Weyl Anomaly in the dilaton-scalar system in 2 dimensional gravity isexamined. We take the heat-kernel regularization for the ultravioletdivergences. Generally the Weyl anomaly is determined by the 2nd orderdifferential (elliptic) operator of the system and the definition of themeasure. We have the freedom of the operator choice caused by the arbitrarinessof total divergences (surface terms) in the action. We examine the Weyl anomalyin connection with such points and the hermiticity of the operator.
