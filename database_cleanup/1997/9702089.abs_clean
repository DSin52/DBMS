We present candidates for the global minimum energy solitons of charge one tonine in the Skyrme model, generated using sophisticated numerical algorithms.Assuming the Skyrme model accurately represents the low energy limit of QCD,these configurations correspond to the classical nuclear ground states of thelight elements. The solitons found are particularly symmetric, for example, thecharge seven skyrmion has icosahedral symmetry, and the shapes are shown to fita remarkable sequence defined by a geometric energy minimization (GEM) rule. Wealso calculate the energies and sizes to within at least a few percentaccuracy. These calculations provide the basis for a future investigation ofthe low energy vibrational modes of skyrmions and hence the possibility oftesting the Skyrme model against experiment.
