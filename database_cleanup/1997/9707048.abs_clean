We develop possible versions of supersymmetric single particle quantummechanics, with application to superstring-bit models in view. We focusprincipally on space dimensions $d=1,2,4,8$, the transverse dimensionalities ofsuperstring in $3,4,6,10$ space-time dimensions. These are the cases for which``classical'' superstring makes sense, and also the values of $d$ for whichHooke's force law is compatible with the simplest superparticle dynamics. Theforce laws with more general ones, including forces which vanish at largedistances? This is an important question because forces between string-bitsthat do not fall off with distance will almost certainly destroy clusterdecomposition. We show that the answer is affirmative for $d=1,2$, negative for$d=8$, and so far inconclusive for $d=4$.
