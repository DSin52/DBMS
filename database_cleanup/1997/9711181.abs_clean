We study static, spherically symmetric, and purely magnetic solutions of theN=4 gauged supergravity in four dimensions. A systematic analysis of thesupersymmetry conditions reveals solutions which preserve 1/4 of thesupersymmetries and are characterized by a BPS-monopole-type gauge field and aglobally hyperbolic, everywhere regular geometry. We show that the theory inwhich these solutions arise can be obtained via compactification often-dimensional supergravity on the group manifold. This result is then used tolift the solutions to ten dimensions.
