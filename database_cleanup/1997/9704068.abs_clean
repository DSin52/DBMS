correctedThe new principle of constrained twistor-like variables is proposed forconstruction of the Cartan 1-forms on the worldsheet of the D=3,4,6 bosonicstrings. The corresponding equations of motion are derived. Among them thereare two well-known Liouville equations for real and complex worldsheetfunctions W(s,\bar s). The third one in which W(s,\bar s) is replaced by thequaternionic worldsheet function is unknown and can be thought of as that ofthe SU(2) nonlinear sigma-model governing the classical dynamics of the bosonicstring in D=6.
