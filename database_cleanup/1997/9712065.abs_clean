We re-examine the quantization of a class of non-polynomial scalar fieldtheories which interpolates continuously from a free one to $\phi^4$ theory.The quantization of such theories is problematic because the Feynman rules maynot be directly obtained. We give a means for calculating the correlationfunctions in this theory. The Feynman rules developed here shall enable furtherprogress in the understanding of the triviality of $\phi^4$ theory in fourdimensions.
