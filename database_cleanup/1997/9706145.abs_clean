We present a detailed study of the analytic structure, BPS spectra andsuperconformal points of the $ N=2 $ susy $ SU(2) $ gauge theories with $N_f=1,2,3 $ massive quark hypermultiplets. We compute the curves of marginalstability with the help of the explicit solutions for the low energy effectiveactions in terms of standard elliptic functions. We show that only a few ofthese curves are relevant. As a generic example, the case of $ N_f=2 $ with twoequal bare masses is studied in depth. We determine the precise existencedomains for each BPS state, and show how they are compatible with the RG flows.At the superconformal point, where two singularities coincide, we prove that(for $ N_f=2 $) the massless spectrum consists of four distinct BPS states andis S-invariant. This is due to the monodromy around the superconformal pointbeing S, providing strong evidence for exact S-duality of the SCFT. For all $N_f $, we compute the slopes $ \omega $ of the $ \beta $-functions at the fixedpoint couplings and show that they are related to the anomalous dimensions $\alpha $ of $ u= < tr \phi^2 > $ by $ \omega= 2 (\alpha -1) $.
