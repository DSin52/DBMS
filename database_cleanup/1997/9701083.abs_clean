We investigate Georgi-Glashow model in terms of a set of explicitly SO(3)gauge invariant dynamical variables. In the new description a novel compactabelian gauge invariance emerges naturally. As a consequence magnetic monopolesoccur as point like "defects" in space time. Their non-perturbativecontribution to the partition function is explicitly included. This procedurecorresponds to dynamical "abelian projection" without gauge fixing. In theHiggs phase the above abelian invariance is to be identified withelectromagnetism. We also study the effect of $\theta$ term in the aboveabelian theory.
