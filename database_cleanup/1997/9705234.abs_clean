We calculate characters and supercharacters for irreducible, admissiblerepresentations of the affine superalgebra sl(2|1) in both the Ramond andNeveu-Schwarz sectors and discuss their modular properties in the special caseof level k=-1/2. We also show that the non-degenerate integrable characterscoincide with some N=4 superconformal characters.
