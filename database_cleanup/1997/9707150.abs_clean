We apply the coadjoint orbit method to construct relativistic nonlinear sigmamodels (NLSM) on the target space of coadjoint orbits coupled with theChern-Simons (CS) gauge field and study self-dual solitons. When the targetspace is given by Hermitian symmetric space (HSS), we find that the systemadmits self-dual solitons whose energy is Bogomol'nyi bounded from below by atopological charge. The Bogomol'nyi potential on the Hermitian symmetric spaceis obtained in the case when the maximal torus subgroup is gauged, and theself-dual equation in the $CP(N-1)$ case is explored. We also discuss theself-dual solitons in the non-compact $SU(1,1)$ case and present a detailedanalysis for the rotationally symmetric solutions.
