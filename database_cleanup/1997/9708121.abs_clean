A non-Grassmanian path integral representation is given for the solution ofthe Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations. The trajectories of the path integralare rendered differentiable by the relativistic corrections. Thenonrelativistic limit is briefly discussed from the point of view of therenormalization group.
