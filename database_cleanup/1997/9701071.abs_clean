Title: Local State Probabilities of Solvable Lattice Models

$A_{n}^{(1)}$ FamilyComments: 13 pages, Latex , 1 figure

We present the results for the local state probabilities (LSP) of thesolvable lattice models, constructed around rational conformal field theorygiven by WZW model on $SO(3)_{4 R}=SU(2)_{4 R} / Z_{2}$ together with primaryfield $\phi_{1}$(symmetric tensor of degree 2). Some conjectures for the LSPfor some higher rank relatives of $A_{n}^{(1)}$ face models are also presented.
