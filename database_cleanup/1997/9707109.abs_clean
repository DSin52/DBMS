Anyon gas with interparticle (retarded) Coulomb interaction has been studied.The resulting system is shown to be a collection of dressed anyons, with ascreening factor introduced in their spin. Close structural similarity with theChern-Simons construction of anyons has helped considerably in computing thescreening effect. Finally the present model is compared with the conventionalChern-Simons construction.
