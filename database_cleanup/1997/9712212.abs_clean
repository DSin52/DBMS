We show that the abelian topological mass mechanism in four dimensions,described by the Cremmer-Sherk action, can be obtained from dimensionalreduction in five dimensions. Starting from a gauge invariant action in fivedimensions, where the dual equivalence between a massless vector field and amassless second-rank antisymmetric field in five dimensions is established, thedimensional reduction is performed keeping only one massive mode. Furthermore,the Kalb-Ramond action and the Stuckelberger formulation for massive spin-1 arerecovered.
