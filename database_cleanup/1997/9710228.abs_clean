The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of BPS black holes can be obtained as theminimum of the mass (= largest central charge). In this letter we investigatethe analog procedure for the matrix model of M-theory. Especially we discusshole and (ii) the $5 \times 5 \times 5$ configuration yielding the 5-d string.After getting their matrix-entropy, we discuss a way of counting of microstatesin matrix theory. As Yang Mills field theory we propose the gauged world volumetheory of the 11-d KK monopole.
