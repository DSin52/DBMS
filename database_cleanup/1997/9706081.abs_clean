We perform a microcanonical study of classical lattice phi^4 field models in3 dimensions with O(n) symmetries. The Hamiltonian flows associated to thesesystems that undergo a second order phase transition in the thermodynamic limitare here investigated. The microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics neatly reveals thepresence of a phase transition through the time averages of conventionalthermodynamical observables. Moreover, peculiar behaviors of the largestLyapunov exponents at the transition point are observed. A Riemanniangeometrization of Hamiltonian dynamics is then used to introduce other relevantobservables, that are measured as functions of both energy density andtemperature. On the basis of a simple and abstract geometric model, we suggestthat the apparently singular behaviour of these geometric observables mightprobe a major topological change of the manifolds whose geodesics are thenatural motions.
