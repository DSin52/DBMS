The string-black hole correspondence is considered in the context of thecorrespondence principle proposed recently by Horowitz and Polchinski. Wedemonstrate that the entropy of string states and the entropy of aSchwarzschild black hole can be matched including the subleading terms whichdepend on mass logarithmically. We argue the necessity to include the stringinteraction (with coupling $g$) in the consideration and propose the$g^2$-dependent modification of the string entropy. The matching of it with theentropy of Schwarzschild black hole is analyzed.
