A Galilean Chern-Simons field theory is formulated for the case of twointeracting spin-1/2 fields of distinct masses M and M'. A method for theconstruction of states containing N particles of mass M and N' particles ofmass M' is given which is subsequently used to display equivalence to thespin-1/2 Aharonov-Bohm effect in the N = N' =1 sector of the model. The latteris then studied in perturbation theory to determine whether there aredivergences in the fourth order (one loop) diagram. It is found that thecontribution of that order is finite (and vanishing) for the case of parallelspin projections while the antiparallel case displays divergences which areknown to characterize the spin zero case in field theory as well as in quantummechanics.
