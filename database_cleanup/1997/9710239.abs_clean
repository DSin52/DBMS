Five and six dimensional SUSY gauge theories, with one or two compactifieddirections, are discussed. The 5d theories with the matter hypermultiplets inthe fundamental representation are associated with the twisted $XXZ$ spinchain, while the group product case with the bi-fundamental matter correspondsto the higher rank spin chains. The Riemann surfaces for $6d$ theories withfundamental matter and two compact directions are proposed to correspond to the$XYZ$ spin chain based on the Sklyanin algebra. We also discuss the obtainedresults within the brane and geometrical engeneering frameworks and explain therelation to the toric diagrams.
