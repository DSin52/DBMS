The semiclassical solution of quantum Dirac constraints in genericconstrained system is obtained by directly calculating in the one-loopapproximation the gauge field path integral with relativistic gauge fixingprocedure. The gauge independence property of this path integral is analyzed bythe method of Ward identities with a special emphasis on boundary conditionsfor gauge fields. The calculations are based on the known reduction algorithmsfor functional determinants extended to gauge theories. The mechanism oftransition from relativistic gauge conditions to unitary gauges, participatingin the construction of this solution, is explicitly revealed. Implications ofthis result in problems with spacetime boundaries, quantum gravity andcosmology are briefly discussed.
