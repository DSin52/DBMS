added, information about one of the authors (M.G.I.) available atGeneral properties of intersecting extremal p-brane solutions of gravitycoupled with dilatons and several different d-form fields in arbitraryspace-time dimensions are considered. It is show that heuristically expectedproperties of the intersecting p-branes follow from the explicit formulae forsolutions. In particular, harmonic superposition and S-duality hold for allp-brane solutions. Generalized T-duality takes place under additionalrestrictions on the initial theory parameters .
