Authors: Michael B. Green

Comments: 24 pages LaTeX. Based on talks given at various conferences. To be

This article reviews the non-perturbative structure of certain higherderivative terms in the type II string theory effective action and theirconnection to one-loop effects in eleven-dimensional supergravity compactifiedon a torus. New material is also included that was not presented in the talks.
