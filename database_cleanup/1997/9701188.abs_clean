The (q_1,q_2) SL(2,Z) string bound states of type IIB superstring theoryadmit two inequivalent (T-dual) representations in eleven dimensions in termsof a fundamental 2-brane. In both cases, the spectrum of membrane oscillationscan be determined exactly in the limit $g^2\to \infty $, where $g^2$ is thetype IIA string coupling. We find that the BPS mass formulas agree, andreproduce the BPS mass spectrum of the $(q_1,q_2)$ string bound state. In thenon-BPS sector, the respective mass formulas apply in different corners of themoduli space. The axiomatic requirement of T-duality in M-theory permits toderive a discrete mass spectrum in a (thin torus) region where standardsupermembrane theory undergoes instabilities.
