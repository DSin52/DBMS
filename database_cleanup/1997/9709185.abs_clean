We apply the method of the Renormalization Group (GR), following thePolchinski point of view, to a model of well developed and isotropic fluidturbulence. The Galilei-invariance is preserved and a universal behavior,related to the change of the stochastic stirring force, is evident by thenumerical results in the inertial region, where a scale-invariant behavior alsoappear. The expected power law of the energy spectrum ($q^{-{5\over 3}}$) isobtained and the Kolmogorov constant $C_K$ agrees with experimental data.
