In this work we pursue the singular-vector analysis of the integrableperturbations of conformal theories that was initiated in hep-th/9603088. Herewe consider the detailed study of the N=1 superconformal theory and show thatall integrable perturbations can be identified from a simple singular-vectorargument. We identify these perturbations as theories based on affine Liesuperalgebras and show that the results we obtain relating two perturbationscan be understood by the extension of affine Toda duality to these theorieswith fermions. We also discuss how this duality is broken in specific cases.
