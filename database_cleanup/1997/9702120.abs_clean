Title: Lie superalgebras of string theories

Comments: 22 pages, LaTeX

We define and describe simple complex Lie superalgbras of vector fields on"supercircles" - simple stringy superalgebras. There are four series of suchalgebras and four exceptional stringy superalgebras. The 13 of the simpleextensions; since two of the distinguish algebras have 3 nontrivial centralextensions each, there are exactly 16 superizations of the Liouville action,Schroedinger equation, KdV hierarchy, etc. We also present the three nontrivialcocycles on the N=4 extended Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond superalgebras in terms ofprimary fields and describe the "classical" stringy superalgebras close to thesimple ones. One of these stringy superalgebras is a Kac-Moody superalgebraG(A) with a nonsymmetrizable Cartan matrix A. Unlike the Kac-Moodysuperalgebras of polynomial growth with symmetrizable Cartan matrix, it can notbe interpreted as a central extension of a twisted loop algebra.The stringysuperalgebras are often referred to as superconformal ones. We discuss howsuperconformal stringy superalgebras really are.
