Monographs, m51 (Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, 1997) ISBN 3-540-63509-2These lectures notes are an intoduction for physicists to several ideas andapplications of noncommutative geometry. The necessary mathematical tools arepresented in a way which we feel should be accessible to physicists. Weillustrate applications to Yang-Mills, fermionic and gravity models, notably wedescribe the spectral action recently introduced by Chamseddine and Connes. Wealso present an introduction to recent work on noncommutative lattices. Thelatter have been used to construct topologically nontrivial quantum mechanicaland field theory models, in particular alternative models of lattice gaugetheory.1. Introduction. 2.
