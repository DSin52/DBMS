We calculate the metric on the D-brane vacuum moduli space for backgrounds ofthe form C^3/Gamma for cyclic groups Gamma. In the simplest procedure ---starting with a flat ``seed'' metric on the covering space --- we find that theresulting D-brane metric is not Ricci-flat. We argue that this is likely to betrue of the true 0-brane metric at weak string coupling.
