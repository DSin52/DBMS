Title: Universal Behavior in Dirac Spectra

Comments: 37 pages, 6 figures, Exentend version of lectures given at the "Nato

Advanced Study Institute" on "Confinement, Duality, and Non-PerturbativeAspects of QCD", Cambridge 1997In these lectures we review recent results on universal fluctuations of QCDDirac spectra and applications of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to QCD. We reviewgeneral properties of Dirac spectra and discuss the relation between chiralsymmetry breaking and correlations of Dirac eigenvalues. In particular, we willfocus on the microscopic spectral density density, i.e. the spectral densitynear zero virtuality on the scale of a typical level spacing. The relation withLeutwyler-Smilga sum-rules will be discussed. The success of applications ofRMT to spectra of 'complex' systems leads us to the introduction of a chiralRandom Matrix Theory (chRMT) with the global symmetries of the QCD partitionfunction. Our central conjecture is that it decribes correlations of QCD Diracspectra. We will review recent universality proofs supporting this conjecture.Lattice QCD results for the microscopic spectral density and for correlationsin the bulk of the spectrum are shown to be in perfect agreement with chRMT. Weclose with a review of chRMT at nonzero chemical potential. Novel features ofspectral universality in nonhermitean matrices will be discussed. As anillustration of mathematical methods used in RMT several important recentresults will be derived in all details. We mention the derivation of themicroscopic spectral density, the universality proof by Akemann, Damgaard,Magnea and Nishigaki, the spectral density of a chRMT at nonzero temperatureand the Stephanov solution for chRMT at nonzero chemical potential.
