We show the existence of a supersymmetry-breaking mechanism in string theory,where N=4 supersymmetry is broken spontaneously to N=2 and N=1 withmoduli-dependent gravitino masses. The BPS spectrum of the theory with lowersupersymmetry is in one-to-one correspondence with the spectrum of theheterotic N=4 string. The mass splitting of the N=4 spectrum depends on themoduli as well as the three R-symmetry charges. In the case of N=4 \to N=2, theperturbative N=2 prepotential is determined by the perturbative N=4 BPS states.This observation led us to suggest a method that determines the exactnon-perturbative prepotential of the effective N=2 supergravity using theshifted spectrum of the non-perturbative BPS states of the underlying N=4theory.
