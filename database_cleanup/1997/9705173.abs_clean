We review several topics of interest in the study of 4d N=1 supersymmetriccompactifications of the heterotic string. After a brief introduction to theconstruction of such models, our focus is on the novel physics which occurs atsingularities in the moduli space of vacua. Among the phenomena we discuss arenonperturbative superpotentials, dynamical generation of poles in variouslow-energy couplings, and phase transitions which change the net number ofchiral generations.
