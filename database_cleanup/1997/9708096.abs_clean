Title: Dynamics and causality constraints in field theory

Authors: Manoelito M. de Souza

We discuss the physical meaning and the geometric interpretation of causalityimplementation in classical field theories. Causality is normally implementedthrough kinematical constraints on fields but we show that in a zero-distancelimit they also carry a dynamical information, which calls for a revision ofour standard concepts of interacting fields. The origin of infinities and otherinconsistencies in field theories is traced to fields defined with support onthe lightcone; a finite and consistent field theory requires a lightconegenerator as the field support.
