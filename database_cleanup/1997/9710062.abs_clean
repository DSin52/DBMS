We compute the exact QED_{3+1} effective action for fermions in the presenceof a family of static but spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field profiles. Anasymptotic expansion of this exact effective action yields an all-ordersderivative expansion, the first terms of which agree with independentderivative expansion computations. These results generalize analogous earlierresults by Cangemi et al in QED_{2+1}.
