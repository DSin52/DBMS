We generalize the scale invariant gravity by allowing a negative kineticenergy term for the classical scalar field. This gives birth to a newscalar-tensor theory of gravity, in which the scalar field is in fact anauxiliary field. For a pure gravity theory without matter, the scale symmetricphase represents an equivalent class of gravity theories, which the Einsteingravity plus a cosmological constant belongs to under a special gauge choice.The one-loop quantum correction of the theory is calculated by using theVilkovisky-DeWitt's method. We find that the scale symmetry is brokendynamically, and that the Einstein gravity is the ground state of the brokenphase. We also briefly discuss the consequent cosmological implications. It isshown that the time-delay experiment restricts the present universe to be veryclose to the ground state.
