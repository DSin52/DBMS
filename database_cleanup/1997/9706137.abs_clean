A specific Friedmann-Roberstson-Walker (FRW) model derived from the theory ofN=1 supergravity with gauged supermatter is considered in this paper. Thesupermatter content is restricted to a vector supermultiplet. The correspondingLorentz and supersymmetry quantum constraints are then derived. Non-trivialsolutions are subsquently found. A no-boundary solution is identified whileanother state may be interpreted as a wormhole solution.
