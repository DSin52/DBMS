Starting with a conformal Quantum Field Theory on the real line, we show thatthe dual net is still conformal with respect to a new representation of theMoebius group. We infer from this that every conformal net is normal andconormal, namely the local von Neumann algebra associated with an intervalcoincides with its double relative commutant inside the local von Neumannalgebra associated with any larger interval. The net and the dual net givetogether rise to an infinite dimensional symmetry group, of which we study aclass of positive energy irreducible representations. We mention howsuperselsection sectors extend to the dual net and we illustrate by exampleshow, in general, this process generates solitonic sectors. We describe the freetheories associated with the lowest weight n representations of PSL(2,R),showing that they violate 3-regularity for n>2. When n>1, we obtain examples ofnon Moebius-covariant sectors of a 3-regular (non 4-regular) net.
