The left-right symmetric gauge model with the symmetry of $SU(3)_c\timesSU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)$ is reconstructed in a new scheme of thenoncommutative differential geometry (NCG) on the discrete space $M_4\timesZ_4$ which is a product space of Minkowski space and four points space. Thecharacteristic point of this new scheme is to take the fermion field to be avector in a 24-dimensional space which contains all leptons and quarks.Corresponding to this specification, all gauge and Higgs boson fields arerepresented in $24\times 24$ matrix forms. We incorporate two Higgs doubletbosons $h$ and $SU(2)_R$ adjoint Higgs $\xi_R$ which are as usual transformedas $(2,2^\ast,0)$ and $(1,3,-2)$ under $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)$,respectively. Owing to the revise of the algebraic rules in a new NCG, we canobtain the necessary potential and interacting terms between these Higgs bosonswhich are responsible for giving masses to the particles included. Among theHiggs doublet bosons, one CP-even scalar boson survives in the weak energyscale and other four scalar bosons acquire the mass of the $SU(2)_R\times U(1)$breaking scale, which is similar to the situation in the standard model.$\xi_R$ is responsible to spontaneously break $SU(2)\ma{R} \times U(1)$ down to$U(1)\ma{Y}$ and so well explains the seesaw mechanism. Up and down quarks havethe different masses through the vacuum expectation value of $h$.
