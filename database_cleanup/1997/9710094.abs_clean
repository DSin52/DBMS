Title: Short Distance Analysis in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory

Authors: Detlev Buchholz

Comments: 7 pages, Latex

Journal-ref: "XIIth International Congress of Mathematical Physics",

pp.173-178, Proceedings Brisbane 1997, International Press 1999Within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory a general method ispresented which allows one to compute and classify the short distance (scaling)limit of any algebra of local observables. The results can be used to determinethe particle and symmetry content of a theory at very small scales and therebygive an intrinsic meaning to notions such as ``parton'' and ``confinement''.The method has been tested in models.
