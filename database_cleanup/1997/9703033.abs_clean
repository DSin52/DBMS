Comments: latex, 10 pages, expanded with proofs and more results

It is found that the 2-index potential in nonabelian theories does not behavegeometrically as a connection but that, considered as an element of the secondde Rham cohomology group twisted by a flat connection, it fits well with allthe properties assigned to it in various physical contexts. We also prove someresults on the Euler characteristic of the twisted de Rham complex.
