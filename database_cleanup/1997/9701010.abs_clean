A new global approach in the study of duality transformations is introduced.The geometrical structure of complex line bundles is generalized to higherorder U(1) bundles which are classified by quantized charges and duality mapsare formulated over these structures. Quantum equivalence is shown between dualtheories. A global constraint is proven to be needed to achieve well definedbundles. These global structures are used to refine the proof of the dualityequivalence between d=11 supermembrane and d=10 IIA Dirichlet supermembrane,giving a complete topological interpretation to their quantized charges.
