We define fermionic collective coordinates for type-IIB Dirichlet instantonsand discuss some effects of the associated fermionic zero modes within thedilute gas framework. We show that the standard rules for clustering of zeromodes in the dilute limit, and the fermion-exchange interactions follow fromworld-sheet Ward identities. Fermion exchange is strongly attractive atstring-scale distances, which makes the short-distance Hagedorn singularitybetween instantons and anti-instantons even stronger.
