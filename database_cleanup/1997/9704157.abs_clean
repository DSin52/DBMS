Manifest T-duality covariance of the one-loop renormalization group flows isshown for a generic bosonic sigma model with an abelian isometry, by referringa set of previously derived consistency conditions to the tangent space of thetarget. For a restricted background, T-duality transformations are then studiedat the next order, and the ensuing consistency conditions are found to besatisfied by the two-loop Weyl anomaly coefficients of the model. Thisrepresents an extremely non-trivial test of the covariance of renormalizationgroup flows under T-duality, and a stronger condition than T-duality invarianceof the string background effective action.
