Title: Modulo 2 periodicity of complex Clifford algebras and electromagnetic

fieldComments: 10 pages, Latex

Electromagnetic field is considered in the framework of Clifford algebra$\C_2$ over a field of complex numbers. It is shown here that a modulo 2periodicity of complex Clifford algebras may be connected with electromagneticfield.
