Title: Covariant Generalisation of Codazzi-Raychaudhuri and Area Change

Equations for Relativistic BranesComments: 29 pages, LaTeX

Journal-ref: J.Geom.Phys. 28 (1998) 271-288

In this paper we derive the generalisations of Gauss-Codazzi, Raychaudhuriand area change equations for classical relativistic branes andmultidimensional fluids in arbitrary background manifolds with metricity andtorsion. The kinematical description we develop is fully covariant and based onthe use of projection tensors tilted with respect to the brane worldsheets.
