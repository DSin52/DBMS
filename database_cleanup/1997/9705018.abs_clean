(Theor. Phys.). A serious gap in the proof of Prop. 2.3 has been filled in,but only under a rationality assumption. The main application to rationalCQFTs is not affected, in fact strenghtened by the new Props. 3.8 and 3.14.Some remarks have been addedJournal-ref: Annales Poincare Phys.Theor. 71 (1999) 359-394

We consider the complete normal field net with compact symmetry groupconstructed by Doplicher and Roberts starting from a net of local observablesin >=2+1 spacetime dimensions and its set of localized (DHR) representations.We prove that the field net does not possess nontrivial DHR sectors, providedthe observables have only finitely many sectors. Whereas the superselectionstructure in 1+1 dimensions typically does not arise from a group, the DRconstruction is applicable to `degenerate sectors', the existence of which (inthe rational case) is equivalent to non-invertibility of Verlinde's S-matrix.We prove Rehren's conjecture that the enlarged theory is non-degenerate, whichimplies that every degenerate theory is an `orbifold' theory. Thus, thesymmetry of a generic model `factorizes' into a group part and a pure quantumpart which still must be clarified.
