Some aspects of the fields of charge two SU(3) monopoles with minimalsymmetry breaking are discussed. A certain class of solutions look like SU(2)monopoles embedded in SU(3) with a transition region or ``cloud'' surroundingthe monopoles. For large cloud size the relative moduli space metric splits asa direct product AH\times R^4 where AH is the Atiyah-Hitchin metric for SU(2)monopoles and R^4 has the flat metric. Thus the cloud is parametrised by R^4which corresponds to its radius and SO(3) orientation. We solve for thelong-range fields in this region, and examine the energy density and rotationalmoments of inertia. The moduli space metric for these monopoles, given byDancer, is also expressed in a more explicit form.
