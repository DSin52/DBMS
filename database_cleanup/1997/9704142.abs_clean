We study critical points of the BPS mass $Z$, the BPS string tension $Z_m$,the black hole potential $V$ and the gauged central charge potential $P$ forM-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau three-folds. We first show that thestabilization equations for $Z$ (determining the black hole entropy) take anextremely simple form in five dimensions as opposed to four dimensions. Thestabilization equations for $Z_m$ are also very simple and determine the sizeof the infinite $adS_3$-throat of the string. The black hole potential inwhich coincide with those of the central charge and non-supersymmetric criticalpoints. We then generalize the discussion to the entire extended K\"ahler coneencompassing topologically different but birationally equivalent Calabi-Yauthree-folds that are connected via flop transitions. We examine behavior of thefour potentials to probe the nature of these phase transitions. We find that$V$ and $P$ are continuous but not smooth across the flop transition, while $Z$and its first two derivatives, as well as $Z_m$ and its first derivative, arecontinuous. This in turn implies that supersymmetric stabilization of $Z$ and$Z_m$ for a given configuration takes place in at most one point throughout theentire extended K\"ahler cone. The corresponding black holes (or string states)interpolate between different Calabi-Yau three-folds. At the boundaries of theextended K\"ahler cone we observe that electric states become massless and/ormagnetic strings become tensionless.
