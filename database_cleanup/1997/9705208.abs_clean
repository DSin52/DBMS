Spectra of a string in $ SL(2,R) $ and three dimensional (BTZ) black holegeometry are discussed. We consider a free field realization of ^sl (2,R)different from the standard ones in treatment of zero-modes. Applying this tothe string model in SL(2,R), we show that the spectrum is ghost-free. Theessence of the argument is the same as Bars' resolution to the ghost problem,but there are differences; for example, the currents do not contain logarithmiccuts. Moreover, we obtain a modular invariant partition function. Thisrealization is also applicable to the analysis of the string in the threedimensional black hole geometry, the model of which is described by an orbifoldof the SL(2,R) WZW model. We obtain ghost-free and modular invariant spectrafor the black hole theory as well. These spectra provide examples of fewsensible spectra of a string in non-trivial backgrounds with curved time and,in particular, in a black hole background with an infinite number ofpropagating modes.
