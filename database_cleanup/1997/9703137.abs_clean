Title: Intrinsic anyonic spin through deformed geometry

Authors: R.S. Dunne

Comments: 26 pages, LaTeX

The properties of the deformed bosonic oscillator, and the quantum groups${\cal U}_q(SL(2))$ and $GL_q(2)$ in the limit as their deformation parameter$q$ goes to a root of unity are investigated and interpreted physically. Theseproperties are seen to be related to fractional supersymmetry and intrinsicanyonic spin. A simple deformation of the Klein-Gordon equation is introduced,based on $GL_q(2)$. When $q$ is a root of unity this equation is a root of theundeformed Klein-Gordon equation.
