Title: On the Second Quantization of M(atrix) Theory

Comments: 3 pages, Latex, an explicit expression for the interaction

Hamiltonian in the Boltzmannian Fock space is givenThe second quantization of M(atrix) theory in the free (Boltzmannian) Fockspace is considered. It provides a possible framework to the recent Susskindproposal that U(N) supersymmetic Yang-Mills theories for all N might beembedded in a single dynamical system. The second quantization of M(atrix)theory can also be useful for the study of the Lorentz symmetry and for theconsideration of processes with creation and annihilation of D-branes.
