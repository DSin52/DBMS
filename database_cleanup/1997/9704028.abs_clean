The normal mode spectrum of the deuteron in the Skyrme model is computed. Wefind a bound doublet mode below the pion mass, which can be related to thewell-known $90^{\circ}$ scattering of two skyrmions. We also find a singlet`breather' mode and another doublet above the pion mass. The qualitativepattern of the spectrum is similar to that recently found for the B=4multiskyrmion. The symmetries of all the vibrational modes are presented.
