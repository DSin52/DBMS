Title: Fusion rules and macroscopic loops from discretized approach to

two-dimensional gravityComments: reference added, 72 pages, latex, 38 postscript figures

We investigate the multi-loop correlators and the multi-point functions forall of the scaling operators in unitary minimal conformal models coupled totwo-dimensional gravity from the two-matrix model. We show that simple fusionrules for these scaling operators exist, and these are summarized in a compactform as fusion rules for loops. We clarify the role of the boundary operatorsand discuss its connection to how loops touch each other. We derive a generalformula for the n-resolvent correlators, and point out the structure similar tothe crossing symmetry of underlying conformal field theory. We discuss theconnection of the boundary conditions of the loop correlators to the touchingof loops for the case of the four-loop correlators.
