We study the graceful exit problem and the role of the stress-energy-momentumtensors in the two-dimensional string cosmology. The one-loop quantumcorrection of conformal fields is incorporated in the arbitrary large $N$ limitto ensure exact quantum solvability. The only solution which gives the boundedcurvature with the asymptotic flatness is restricted to the first branch undersome conditions. However, even in this case, the accelerating expansion isforever. We show that the only nonvanishing quantum stress-momentum tensor isthe pressure part($T_{xx}$) which is of relevance to the dynamical evolution ofthe universe in the comoving coordinate. The quantum energy part is zero sincethe negative contribution of the induced conformal matters always cancels thepositive quantity of the induced dilaton part in terms of the constraintequation.
