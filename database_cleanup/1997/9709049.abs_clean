We study the problem of baryon stability in M theory, starting from realisticfour-dimensional string models constructed using the free-fermion formulationof the weakly-coupled heterotic string. Suitable variants of these modelsmanifest an enhanced custodial gauge symmetry that forbids to all orders theappearance of dangerous dimension-five baryon-decay operators. We exhibit theunderlying geometric (bosonic) interpretation of these models, which have a$Z_2 \times Z_2$ orbifold structure similar, but not identical, to the class ofCalabi-Yau threefold compactifications of M and F theory investigated by Voisinand Borcea. A related generalization of their work may provide a solution tothe problem of proton stability in M theory.
