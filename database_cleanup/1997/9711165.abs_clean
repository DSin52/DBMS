We show that in certain superstring compactifications, gauge theories onnoncommutative tori will naturally appear as D-brane world-volume theories.This gives strong evidence that they are well-defined quantum theories. It alsogives a physical derivation of the identification proposed by Connes, Douglasand Schwarz of Matrix theory compactification on the noncommutative torus withM theory compactification with constant background three-form tensor field.
