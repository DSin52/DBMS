Title: Quantum Field Theories on Algebraic Curves

Authors: F. Ferrari and J. T. Sobczyk

Comments: 12 pages, Plain TeX, Talk delivered by F. Ferrari at the IX Max Born

Symposium, Karpacz (PL), September 24--28, 1996In this talk the main features of the operator formalism for the $b-c$systems on general algebraic curves developed in refs. [1-2] are reviewed. Thefirst part of the talk is an introduction to the language of algebraic curves.Some explicit techniques for the construction of meromorphic tensors areexplained. The second part is dedicated to the discussion of the $b-c$ systems.Some new results concerning the concrete representation of the basic operatoralgebra of the $b-c$ systems and the calculation of divisors on algebraiccurves have also been included.
