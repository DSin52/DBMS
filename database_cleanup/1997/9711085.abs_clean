The statistics of soliton sectors of massive 2D field theories is analysed.In the soliton field algebra, the non-local commutation relations aredetermined and Weak Locality, Spin-Statistics and CPT theorems are proven.These theorems depart from their usual appearance due to the broken symmetryconnecting the inequivalent vacua. An interpretation in terms of modular theoryis given. For the neutral subalgebra, the theorems hold in the familiar form,and Twisted Locality is derived.
