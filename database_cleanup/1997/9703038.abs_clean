We address the problem of a non-perturbative formulation of superstringtheory by means of the recently proposed matrix models. For the model byIshibashi, Kawai, Kitazawa and Tsuchiya (IKKT), we perform one-loop calculationof the interaction between operator-like solutions identified with D-braneconfigurations of type IIB superstring (in particular, for parallel moving androtated static p-branes). Comparing to the superstring calculations, we showthat the matrix model reproduces the superstring results only at largedistances or small velocities, corresponding to keeping only the lowest massclosed string modes. We propose a modification of the IKKT matrix modelintroducing an integration over an additional Hermitian matrix required to havepositive definite eigenvalues, which is similar to the square root of themetric in the continuum Schild formulation of IIB superstrings. We show thatfor this new matrix action the Nambu-Goto version of the Green-Schwarz actionis reproduced even at quantum level.
