Recent work on the action of T duality on Dirichlet-branes is generalized tothe case in which the open string satisfies boundary conditions that areneither Neumann nor Dirichlet. This is achieved by implementing T duality as acanonical transformation of the $\sigma$-model path integral. A class ofboundary interactions that violate conformal symmetry is found to be T-dual ofa correspondingly non-conformal class of boundary conditions. The analogy withsome problems in boundary-non-critical quantum mechanics of interest forcondensed matter is pointed out.
