We investigate the behavior of small perturbations around the Kaluza-Kleinmonopole in the five dimensional space-time. We find that the even paritygravitational wave does not propagate in the five dimensional space-time withKaluza-Klein monopole provided that the gravitational wave is constant in thefifth direction. We conclude that a gravitational wave and a U(1) magneticmonopole do not coexist in five dimensional Kaluza-Klein spacetime.
