The gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in the quenched-ladder approximation hasnon-trivial dynamics near a critical scaling region (critical curve) separatinga chiral symmetric and a dynamically chiral symmetry broken phase. Scalar andpseudoscalar composites corresponding to the four-fermion interaction becomerelevant degrees of freedom at short distances, which is reflected in theappearance of a large anomalous dimension of the four-fermion operators. Amethod is introduced for solving the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the Yukawavertex in specific kinematic regimes. This allows one to derive an analyticexpression for the scalar propagator, which is valid along the entire criticalcurve. The mass and width of the scalar composites in the critical scalingregion are reexamined and the conformal phase transition at the critical gaugecoupling is discussed.
