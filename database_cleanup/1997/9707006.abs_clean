Fundamental Problems of High Energy Physics and Field Theory, 24-26 June1997, Protvino, RussiaThere are known problems of Lorentz-Dirac equation for moving withacceleration charged particle in classical electrodynamics. The model ofextended in one dimension particle is proposed and shown that electromagneticself-interaction can lead (with appropriate choice of retarded and advancedinteractions) to zero change in particle momentum. The hypothesis ischange in particle momentum
