We calculate the effective potential of the scalar theory at finitetemperature under the super-daisy approximation, after expressing itsderivative with respect to mass square in terms of the full propagator. Thisexpression becomes the self-consistent equation for the derivative of theeffective potential. We find the phase transition is first order with thisapproximation. We compare our result with others.
