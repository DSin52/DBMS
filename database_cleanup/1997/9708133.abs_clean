Title: Gravitation as a Many Body Problem

Comments: RevteX file, 7 pp., Talk given at the Confernce ``Beyond the Standard

Model V'', April 29-May 4, 1997, Balholm, NorwaySystemsThe idea of viewing gravitation as a many body phenomenon is put forwardhere. Physical arguments supporting this idea are briefly reviewed. The basicmathematical object of the new gravitational mechanics is a matrix ofoperators. Striking similarity of the method of R-matrix (QISM) to themathematical formulation of the new gravitational mechanics is pointed out. Thes-wave difference Schrodinger equation describing a process of emission ofradiation by a gravitating particle is shown to be analogous to the Baxterequation of the QISM.
