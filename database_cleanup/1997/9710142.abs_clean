Using the harmonic superspace background field formulation for general D=4,N=2 super Yang-Mills theories, with matter hypermultiplets in arbitraryrepresentations of the gauge group, we present the first rigorous proof of theN=2 non-renormalization theorem; specifically, the absence of ultravioletdivergences beyond the one-loop level. Another simple consequence of thebackground field formulation is the absence of the leading non-holomorphiccorrection to the low-energy effective action at two loops.
