The Gross-Neveu model with chemical potential is investigated as a low-energyeffective theory of polyacetylene. In particular, we focus on the abrupt changein the features of electric conductivity such as sharp rise in the Pauliparamagnetism at dopant concentration of about 6%. We will try to explain it bythe finite density phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model. The thermodynamicBethe ansatz is combined with the large-N expansion to construct thermodynamicsof the Gross-Neveu model. A first-order phase transition is found in leadingorder in the 1/N expansion and it appears to be stable against the 1/Ncorrection. The next to leading order correction to the critical dopantconcentration is explicitly calculated.
