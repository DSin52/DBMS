We review several aspects of heterotic, type II, F-theory, and M-theorycompactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds. In the context ofdualities we focus on the heterotic gauge structure determined by the varioustypes of fibration relevant in the framework of heterotic/type II duality inD=4 as well as 4D F-theory. We also consider transitions between Calabi-Yaumanifolds in both three and four dimensions and review some of the consequencesfor the behavior of the superpotential.
