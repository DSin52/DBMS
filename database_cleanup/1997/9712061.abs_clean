In the IR limit the Matrix string theory is expected to be described by the$S^N\R^{8}$ supersymmetric orbifold sigma model. Recently Dijkgraaf, Verlindeand Verlinde proposed a vertex that may describe the type IIA stringinteraction. In this paper using this interaction vertex we derive the fourgraviton scattering amplitude from the orbifold model in the large $N$ limit.
