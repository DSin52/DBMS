Title: Solution of a Relativistic Three-Body Problem

Comments: The second revision of this paper is minor, pointing out that the

theory presented here is not Hamiltonian quantum mechanics but has insteadthe dispersion-theoretic foundation discussed extensively in HPN, Phys. Rev.C26, 1858-1877 (1982)Journal-ref: Few Body Syst. 27 (1999) 123-139

Starting from a relativistic s-wave scattering length model for the twoparticle input we construct an unambiguous, unitary solution of therelativistic three body problem given only the masses $m_a,m_b,m_c$ and themasses of the two body bound states $\mu_{bc},\mu_{ca},\mu_{ab}$.
