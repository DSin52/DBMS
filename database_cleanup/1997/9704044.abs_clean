We study brane configurations which correspond to field theories in fourdimension with N=2 and N=1 supersymmetry. In particular we discuss branemotions that translate to Seiberg's duality in N=1 models recently studied byElitzur, Giveon and Kutasov. We investigate, using the brane picture, themoduli spaces of the dual theories. Deformations of these models like massterms and vacuum expectation values of scalar fields can be identified withpositions of branes. The map of these deformations between the electric anddual magnetic theories is clarified. The models we study reproduce known fieldtheory results and we provide an example of new dual pairs with N=1supersymmetry. Possible relations between brane configurations andnon-supersymmetric field theories are discussed.
