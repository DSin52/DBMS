Gauging the M-2-brane effective action with respect to an Abelian isometry insuch a way that the invariance under gauge transformations of the 3-formpotential is maintained (slightly modified) we obtain a fully covariant actionwith 11-dimensional target space that gives the massive D-2-brane effectiveaction upon dimensional reduction in the direction of the gauged isometry.
