The mechanism for the generation of multipole moments due to an externalfield is presented for the Born-Infeld charged particle. The 'polarizabilitycoefficient' for arbitrary l-pole moment is calculated. The l-th coefficient isproportional to the (2l+1)-th power of the characteristic length in theBorn-Infeld theory. Physical implications are discussed.
