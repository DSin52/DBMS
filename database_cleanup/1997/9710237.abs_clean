We consider the Compton amplitude for the scattering of a photon and a(massless) ``electron/positron'' at one loop (i.e. genus one) in afour-dimensional fermionic heterotic string model. Starting from thebosonization of the world-sheet fermions needed to explicitly construct thespin-fields representing the space-time fermions, we present all the steps ofthe computation which leads to the explicit form of the amplitude as anintegral of modular forms over the moduli space.
