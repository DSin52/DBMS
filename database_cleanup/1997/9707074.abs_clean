Functional relations among the fusion hierarchy of quantum transfer matricesgive a novel derivation of the TBA equations, namely without string hypothesis.This is demonstrated for two important models of 1D highly correlated electronsystems, the supersymmetric $t-J$ model and the supersymmetric extended Hubbardmodel. As a consequence, "the excited state TBA" equations, which characterizecorrelation lengths, are explicitly derived for the $t-J$ model. To theauthors' knowledge, this is the first explicit derivation of excited state TBAequations for 1D lattice electron systems.
