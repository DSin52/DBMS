Title: Renormalization Group Fixed Points and Connections with Duality in

Various DimensionsComments: 13 pages. Added reference. To appear in Proc. of Puri Conference '96

We review some recent results concerning gauge theories in variousdimensions. In particular, we discuss RG fixed points and ``mirror'' symmetryduality in 3d N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories and a classification ofnon-trivial RG fixed points in 5d N=1 supersymmetric theories.
