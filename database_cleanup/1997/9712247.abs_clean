We examine the general conditions for the existence of the complex structureintrinsic in the Gupta-Bleuler quantization method for the specific case ofmixed first and second class fermionic constraints in an arbitrary space-timedimension. The cases d=3 and 10 are shown to be of prime importance. Theexplicit solution for d=10 is presented.
