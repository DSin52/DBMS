We consider eight-brane configurations in M(atrix) theory and compute theirinteraction potentials with gravitons, membranes, and four-branes. We comparethese results with the interactions of D8-branes with D0-branes, D2-branes, andD4-branes in IIA string theory. We find agreement between the two approachesfor eight-brane interactions with two-branes and four-branes. A discrepancy isnoted in the case with zero-branes.
