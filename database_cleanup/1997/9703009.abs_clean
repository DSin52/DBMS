The SL(2,R) invaraint ten dimensional type IIB superstring effectiveaction is compactified on a torus to D spacetime dimensions. The transformationproperties of scalar, vector and tensor fields, appearing after the dimensionalreduction, are obtained in order to maintain the SL(2,R)} invariance ofthe reduced effective action. The symmetry of the action enables one togenerate new string vacua from known configurations. As illustrative examples,new black hole solutions are obtained in five and four dimensions from a givenset of solutions of the equations of motion.
