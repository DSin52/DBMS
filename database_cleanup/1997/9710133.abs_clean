Title: Functional integral over velocities for a spinning particle with and

without anomalous magnetic moment in a constant electromagnetic fieldComments: latex, 19 pages

Journal-ref: J.Phys. A30 (1997) 5225-5238

The technique of functional integration over velocities is applied to thecalculation of the propagator of a spinning particle with and without anomalousmagnetic moment. A representation for the spin factor is obtained in thiscontext for the particle in a constant electromagnetic field. As a by-product,we also obtain a Schwinger representation for the first case.
