In the DHR theory of superselection sectors, one usually considers stateswhich are local excitations of some vacuum state. Here, we extend this analysisto local excitations of a class of "infravacuum" states appearing in modelswith massless particles. We show that the corresponding superselectionstructure, the statistics of superselection sectors and the energy-momentumspectrum are the same as with respect to the vacuum state. (The latter resultis obtained with a novel method of expressing the shape of the spectrum interms of properties of local charge transfer cocycles.) These findings provideevidence to the effect that infravacua are a natural starting point for theanalysis of the superselection structure in theories with long-range forces.
