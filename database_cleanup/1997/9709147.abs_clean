The semiclassical approximation for the partition function in Chern-Simonsgauge theory is derived using the invariant integration method. Volume andscale factors which were undetermined and had to be fixed by hand in previousderivations are automatically taken account of in this framework. Agreementwith Witten's exact expressions for the partition function in the weak coupling(large k) limit is verified for gauge group SU(2) and spacetimes S^3, S^2 xS^1, S^1 x S^1 x S^1 and L(p,q).
