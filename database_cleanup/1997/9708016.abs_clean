It is well-known that the SO(32) and $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic strings can becontinuously connected to each other in nine dimensions. Since thestrong-coupling duals of these theories are respectively the SO(32) Type Itheory and M-theory compactified on a line segment, there should be acorresponding continuous connection between the Type I string and M-theory. Inthis paper, we give an explicit construction of this dual connecting theory.Our construction also enables us to realize the $E_8\times E_8$ heteroticstring as a D-string soliton of the Type I theory. This provides a usefulalternative description of the D-brane bound states previously discussed from aType I' point of view.
