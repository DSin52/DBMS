We discuss a set of generalized, necessary conditions for non-trivial,interacting fixed points in six dimensional supersymmetric field theories. Weuse string theory to argue for the existence of infinite families ofinteracting RG fixed point theories. The theories are based on certain gaugegroups and matter content, which we identify, along with additional tensormultiplets. They are conjectured to arise in the world-volume of Type I D5branes at orbifold singularities.
