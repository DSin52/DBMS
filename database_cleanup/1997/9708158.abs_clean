Title: Effective action of quantum fields in the space-time of a cylindrically

symmetric spinning bodyComments: 45 pages LaTeX, 3 figures

The aim of this article is to calculate (to first order in $\hbar$) therenormalized effective action of a self interacting massive scalar fieldpropagating in the space-time due to a cylindrically symmetric, rotating body.The vacuum (exterior space-time) contribution is model independent, we alsoconsider the simplest case of a core (interior space-time) model, namely acylindrical shell. The heat kernel of the system is calculated, and used toobtain an expression for the determinant of the Klein-Gordon operator on thespace-time manifold. New ultra-violet poles are discovered, and regularizationtechniques are then employed to render finite the Klein-Gordon determinant andconsequently extract the regularized one loop effective action for a selfinteracting scalar field theory. The coupling constants of the theory are thenrenormalized. As a test case a conical singularity with non-zero flux is alsoconsidered.
