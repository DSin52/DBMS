Different finite difference replacements for the derivative are analyzed inthe context of the Heisenberg commutation relation. The type of the finitedifference operator is shown to be tied to whether one can naturally consider$P$ and $X$ to be self-adjoint and skew self-adjoint or whether they have to beviewed as creation and annihilation operators. The first class, generalizingthe central difference scheme, is shown to give unitary equivalentrepresentations. For the second case we construct a large class of examples,generalizing previously known difference operator realizations of $[P,X]=Id$.
