Based on a detailed analysis of nonlinear field equations of the SU(2)Yang-Mills-Higgs system, we obtain the effective field theory describinglow-energy interaction of BPS dyons and massless particles (i.e., photons andHiggs particles). Our effective theory manifests electromagnetic duality andspontaneously broken scale symmetry, and reproduces the multimonopole modulispace dynamics of Manton in a suitable limit. Also given is a generalization ofour approach to the case of BPS dyons in a gauge theory with an arbitrary gaugegroup that is maximally broken.
