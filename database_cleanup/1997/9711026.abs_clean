The $CP^2$ model, with and without a generalized Hopf term, is studied usingthe collective coordinate approximation. In the spirit of this approximation,an ansatz is given which in previous numerical studies was seen to give a goodparameterization of the numerical solution. The equations of motion for thecollective coordinates are then solved analytically, for solitons closetogether and for solitons far apart. The solutions show how the generalizedHopf term changes the scattering angle which in its absence is $90^{\circ}$.
