We study field theories in the limit that a compactified dimension becomeslightlike. In almost all cases the amplitudes at each order of perturbationtheory diverge in the limit, due to strong interactions among the longitudinalzero modes. The lightlike limit generally exists nonperturbatively, but is morecomplicated than might have been assumed. Some implications for the matrixtheory conjecture are discussed.
