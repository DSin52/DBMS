We show that the topological charge of the n-soliton solution of thesine-Gordon equation n is related to the genus g > 1 of a constant negativecurvature compact surface described by this configuration. The relation isn=2(g-1), where n is even. The moduli space of complex dimension B(g)=3(g-1)corresponds precisely to the freedom to choosing the configuration with nsolitons of arbitrary positions and velocities. We speculate also that the oddsoliton states will describe the unoriented surfaces.
