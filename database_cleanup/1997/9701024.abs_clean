By an explicit construction, it is shown that the geometry of the SU(3) pionmultiplet with respect to the group manifold SU_L(3) x SU_R(3) maybe deformedto admit a second pseudoscalar multiplet that is analogous to the Z_0 inunified theories of the electroweak interactions. This observation is found toplay a key role in the construction of the N = 1 supersymmetric models withpions and Dirac-like spin-1/2 superpartners ("pionini").
