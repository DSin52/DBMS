spontaneously broken symmetryAuthors: Elisabeth Kraus

puzzle -- What can we learn from LEP II, LHC, NLC, and FMC?"Callan-Symanzik and renormalization group equation are discussed for the$U(1)$-axial model and it is shown that the symmetric model is not theasymptotic version of the spontaneously broken one due to mass logarithms inthe $\beta$-functions. The Callan-Symanzik equation of the standard model isseen to have the same form as the one of the simple model.
