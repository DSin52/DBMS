A fundamental string with non-zero winding number can unwind in the presenceof a Kaluza-Klein monopole. We use this fact to deduce the presence of a zeromode for the Kaluza-Klein monopole corresponding to excitations carrying Helectric charge and we study the coupling of this zero mode to fundamentalstrings. We also a describe a T-dual process in which the momentum of afundamental string ``unwinds'' in the presence of a H monopole. We use thecoupling of string winding modes to the dyon collective coordinate of theKaluza-Klein monopole to argue that there are stringy corrections to theKaluza-Klein monopole which are in accordance with T-duality.
