It is shown that the measurement algebra of Schwinger, a characterization ofthe properties of Pauli measurements of the first and second kinds, forming thefoundation of his formulation of quantum mechanics over the complex field, hasa quaternionic generalization. In this quaternionic measurement algebra some ofthe notions of quaternionic quantum mechanics are clarified. The conditionsimposed on the form of the corresponding quantum field theory are studied, andthe quantum fields are constructed. It is shown that the resulting quantumfields coincide with the fermion or boson annihilation-creation operatorsobtained by Razon and Horwitz in the limit in which the number of particles inphysical states $N \to \infty$.
