We study the initial value problem for actions which contain non-trivialfunctions of integrals of local functions of the dynamical variable. Incontrast to many other non-local actions, the classical solution set of thesesystems is at most discretely enlarged, and may even be restricted, withrespect to that of a local theory. We show that the solutions are those of alocal theory whose (spacetime constant) parameters vary with the initial valuedata according to algebraic equations. The various roots of these algebraicequations can be plausibly interpreted in quantum mechanics as differentcomponents of a multi-component wave function. It is also possible that theconsistency of these algebraic equations imposes constraints upon the initialvalue data which appear miraculous from the context of a local theory.
