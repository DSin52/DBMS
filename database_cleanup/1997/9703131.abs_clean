We identify a class of 2+1 dimensional models, involving multipleChern-Simons gauge fields, in which a form of classical confinement occurs.This confinement is not cumulative, but allows finite mass combinations ofindividually confined objects, as in baryons. The occurrence and nature of thephenomena depends on number theoretic properties of the couplings and charges.
