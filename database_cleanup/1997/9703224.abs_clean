N=2 extension of affine algebra $\hat{sl(2)\oplus u(1)}$ possesses a hiddenglobal N=4 supersymmetry and provides a second hamiltonian structure for a newN=4 supersymmetric integrable hierarchy defined on N=2 affine supercurrents.This system is an N=4 extension of at once two hierarchies, N=2 NLS and N=2mKdV ones. It is related to N=4 KdV hierarchy via a generalizedSugawara-Feigin-Fuks construction which relates N=2 $\hat{sl(2)\oplus u(1)}$algebra to ``small'' N=4 SCA. We also find the underlying affine hierarchy foranother integrable system with the N=4 SCA second hamiltonian structure,``quasi'' N=4 KdV hierarchy. It respects only N=2 supersymmetry. For both newhierarchies we construct scalar Lax formulations. We speculate that any N=2affine algebra admitting a quaternionic structure possesses N=4 supersymmetryand so can be used to produce N=4 supersymmetric hierarchies. This suggests away of classifying all such hierarchies.
