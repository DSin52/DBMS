In quantum gravity, fields may lose quantum coherence by scattering offvacuum fluctuations in which virtual black hole pairs appear and disappear.Although it is not possible to properly compute the scattering off suchfluctuations, we argue that one can get useful qualitative results, whichprovide a guide to the possible effects of such scattering, by considering aquantum field on the $C$ metric, which has the same topology as a virtual blackhole pair. We study a scalar field on the Lorentzian $C$ metric background,with the scalar field in the analytically-continued Euclidean vacuum state. Wefind that there are a finite number of particles at infinity in this state,contrary to recent claims made by Yi. Thus, this state is not determined bydata at infinity, and there is loss of quantum coherence in this semi-classicalcalculation.
