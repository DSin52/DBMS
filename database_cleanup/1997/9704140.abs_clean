Dubna, 1996In the framework of the generalized Hamiltonian formalism by Dirac, the localsymmetries of dynamical systems with first- and second-class constraints areinvestigated in the general case without restrictions on the algebra ofconstraints. The method of constructing the generator of local-symmetrytransformations is obtained from the requirement for them to map the solutionsof the Hamiltonian equations of motion into the solutions of the sameequations. It is proved that second-class constraints do not contribute to thetransformation law of the local symmetry entirely stipulated by all thefirst-class constraints (and only by them) of an equivalent set passing towhich from the initial constraint set is always possible and is presented. Amechanism of occurrence of higher derivatives of coordinates and groupparameters in the symmetry transformation law in the Noether second theorem iselucidated. In the latter case it is shown that the obtained transformations ofsymmetry are canonical in the extended (by Ostrogradsky) phase space. It isthereby shown in the general case that the degeneracy of theories with thefirst- and second-class constraints is due to their invariance underlocal-symmetry transformations. It is also shown in the general case that theaction functional and the corresponding Hamiltonian equations of motion areinvariant under the same quasigroup of local-symmetry transformations.
