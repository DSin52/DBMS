A new first order action for type IIB Dirichlet 3-brane is proposed. Its formis inspired by the superfield equations of motion obtained recently from thegeneralized action principle. The action involves auxiliary symmetric spintensor fields. It seems promising for a reformulation of the generalized actionin a structure most adequate for investigating the extrinsic geometry of thesuper-3- brane, but also for further studies of string dualities.
