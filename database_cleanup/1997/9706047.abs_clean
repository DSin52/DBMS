We propose a mechanism in which, using an eightbrane, a sixbrane ends on a NSbrane in type IIA superstring theory. We use this mechanism to construct N=1supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions with chiral matter localizedin different points in space. Anomaly cancellation for the gauge theories issatisfied by requiring RR charge conservation for the various type IIA fields.The construction allows us to study a curious phase transition in which thenumber of flavors in supersymmetric QCD depends on the value of the tendimensional cosmological constant. These phenomena are related to the fact thatevery time a D8-brane crosses a NS brane, a D6-brane is created in betweenthem.
