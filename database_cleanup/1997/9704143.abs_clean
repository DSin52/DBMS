We construct the most general supersymmetric configuration of D2-branes andD6-branes on a 6-torus. It contains arbitrary numbers of branes at relativeU(3) angles. The corresponding supergravity solutions are constructed andexpressed in a remarkably simple form, using the complex geometry of thecompact space. The spacetime supersymmetry of the configuration is verifiedexplicitly, by solution of the Killing spinor equations. Our configurations canbe interpreted as a 16-parameter family of regular extremal black holes in fourdimensions. Their entropy is interpreted microscopically by counting thedegeneracy of bound states of D-branes. Our result agrees in detail with theprediction for the degeneracy of BPS states in terms of the quartic invariantof the E(7,7) duality group.
