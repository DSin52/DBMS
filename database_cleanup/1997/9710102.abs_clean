I compare the calculations of special $F^4$ and $R^4$ terms in the(toroidally-compactified) heterotic and type-I effective actions. Besideschecking duality, this elucidates the quantitative rules of D-brane calculus. Iexplain in particular (a) why D-branes do not run in loops, and (b) how theirinstanton contributions arise from orbifold fixed points of their moduli space.The instanton sum has a simple representation as a sum of the elliptic generaof matrix models.
