We investigate how the gap equations are obtained in the light-frontformalism within the four-Fermi theories. Instead of the zero-mode constraint,we find that the "fermionic constraints" on nondynamical spinor components areresponsible for symmetry breaking. Careful treatment of the infrared divergenceis indispensable for obtaining the gap equation.
