We generalize the Drinfeld-Sokolov formalism of bosonic integrablehierarchies to superspace, in a way which systematically leads to the zerocurvature formulation for the supersymmetric integrable systems starting fromthe Lax equation in superspace. We use the method of symmetric space as well asthe non-Abelian gauge technique to obtain the supersymmetric integrablehierarchies of the AKNS type from the zero curvature condition in superspacewith the graded algebras, sl(n+1,n), providing the Hermitian symmetric spacestructure.
