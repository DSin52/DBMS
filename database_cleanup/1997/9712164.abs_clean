We discuss higher derivative interactions in the type IIB superstring in tendimensions. From the fundamental string point of view, the non-perturbativecorrections are due to D-instantons. We argue that they can alternatively beunderstood as arising from $(p,q)$-strings. We derive a non-renormalizationtheorem for eight-derivative bosonic interactions, which states that termsinvolving either NS-NS or R-R fields occur at tree-level and one-loop only. Byusing the $SL(2, Z)$ symmetry of M-theory on $T^2$, we show that in orderfor the possible $R^{3m+1} (m=1,2,...)$ interactions in M-theory to have aconsistent perturbative expansion in nine dimensions, $m$ must be odd. Thus,only $R^{6N+4} (N=0,1,...)$ terms can be present in M-theory and their stringtheory counterparts arise at $N$ and $2N+1$ loops. Finally, we treat an exampleof fermionic term.
