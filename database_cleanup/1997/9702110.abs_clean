We derive the universal threshold corrections in heterotic string theoryincluding a continuous Wilson line. Unification of gauge and gravitationalcouplings is shown to be possible even within perturbative string theory. Therelative importance of gauge group dependent and independent thresholds onunification is clarified. Equipped with these results we can then attempt anextrapolation to the strongly coupled heterotic string -- M-theory. We arguethat such an extrapolation might be meaningful because of the holomorphicstructure of the gauge coupling function and the close connection of thethreshold corrections to the anomaly cancelation mechanism.
