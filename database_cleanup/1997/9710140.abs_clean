The Jackiw-Teitelboim gauge formulation of the 1+1 dimensional gravity allowsus to relate different gauge fixing conditions with integrable hierarchies ofevolution equations. We show that the equations for the Zweibein fields can bewritten as a pair of time reversed evolution equations of thereaction-diffusion type, admitting dissipative solutions. The spectralparameter for the related Lax pair appears as the constant valued spinconnection associated with the $SO(1,1)$ gauge symmetry. Spontaneous breakingof the non-compact symmetry and the irreversible evolution are discussed.
