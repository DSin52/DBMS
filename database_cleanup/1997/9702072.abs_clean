For slowly varying fields the vacuum functional of a quantum field theory maybe expanded in terms of local functionals. This expansion satisfies its ownform of the Schr\"odinger equation from which the expansion coefficents can befound. For scalar field theory in 1+1 dimensions we show that this approachcorrectly reproduces the short-distance properties as contained in thecounter-terms. We also describe an approximate simplification that occurs forthe Sine-Gordon and Sinh-Gordon vacuum functionals.
