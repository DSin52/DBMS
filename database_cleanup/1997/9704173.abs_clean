We present a general algorithm which permits to construct solutions in stringcosmology for heterotic and type-IIB superstrings in four dimensions. Using arotations, along with the usual generating techniques associated to Gerochtransformations in Einstein frame, we obtain solutions with all relevantlow-energy remnants of the string theory. To exemplify our algorithm we presentan inhomogeneous string cosmology with S^3 topology of spatial sections,discuss some properties of the solution and point out some subtleties involvedin the concept of homogeneity and isotropy in string cosmology.
