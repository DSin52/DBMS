Several dynamical aspects of the SU(2) Seiberg-Witten models with N_f quarkhypermultiplets are explored. We first clarify the meaning of the number of thesingularities of the space of vacua. CP invariance of the theories are thenstudied and periodicities of theories in \theta with and without bare quarkmasses are obtained ((4-N_f)\pi and \pi, respectively). CP noninvariance at ageneric point of QMS manifests itself as the electric and quark-number chargefractionalizations for the dyons; we show that the exact Seiberg-Wittensolution contains such effects correctly, in agreement with the semiclassicalanalysis recently made by F.Ferrari. Upon N=1 perturbation the low energyeffective theories at the singularities display confinement, and in most caseschiral symmetry breaking as a consequence. In one of the vacua for N_f=3an example of oblique confinement of 't Hooft. We discuss further theconsistency of the physical picture found here by studying the effects of softsupersymmetry breaking as well as the behavior of the theory in the N=1 limit.
