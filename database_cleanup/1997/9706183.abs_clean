Authors: C.R. Gattringer, L.D. Paniak and G.W. Semenoff

Comments: Talk presented by G.W.S. at the Conference on Recent Developments in

Non-Perturbative Quantum Field Theory (AIJIC 97), May 26-30 1997 at Seoul,South Korea. 25 pages LaTeX, 5 figures, uses psfig and mprocl.styThe statistical mechanics of a mixed gas of adjoint and fundamentalrepresentation charges interacting via 1+1-dimensional U(N) gauge fields isinvestigated. In the limit of large N we show that there is a first orderdeconfining phase transition for low densities of fundamental charges. As thedensity of fundamental charges becomes comparable to the adjoint charge densitythe phase transition becomes a third order one.
