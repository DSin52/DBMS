The scaling limit of the spectrum, $S$ matrix, and of the form factors of thepolarization operator in the six vertex model has been found. The result forthe form factors is consistent with the form factors of the sine-Gordon modelfound recently by Lukyanov. We discuss the origin of the structure of the freefield representation for the sine-Gordon model at the critical coupling fromthe point of view of the lattice model.
