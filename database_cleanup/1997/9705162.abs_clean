It is argued that D=10 type II strings and M-theory in D=11 have D-5 branesand 9-branes that are not standard p-branes coupled to anti-symmetric tensors.The global charges in a D-dimensional theory of gravity consist of a momentum$P_M$ and a dual D-5 form charge $K_{M_1...M_{D-5}}$, which is related to theNUT charge. On dimensional reduction, P gives the electric charge and K themagnetic charge of the graviphoton. The charge K is constructed and shown tooccur in the superalgebra and BPS bounds in $D\ge 5$, and leads to a NUT-chargemodification of the BPS bound in D=4. $K$ is carried by Kaluza-Klein monopoles,which can be regarded as D-5 branes. Supersymmetry and U-duality imply that thetype IIB theory has (p,q) 9-branes. Orientifolding with 32 (0,1) 9-branes givesthe type I string, while modding out by a related discrete symmetry with 32(1,0) 9-branes gives the SO(32) heterotic string. Symmetry enhancement, theeffective world-volume theories and the possibility of a twelve dimensionalorigin are discussed.
