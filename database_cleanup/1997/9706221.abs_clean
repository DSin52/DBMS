We generalize previous work on inhomogeneous pre-big bang cosmology byincluding the effect of non-trivial moduli and antisymmetric-tensor/axionfields. The general quasi-homogeneous asymptotic solution---as one approachesthe big bang singularity from perturbative initial data---is given and itsrange of validity is discussed, allowing us to give a general quantitativeestimate of the amount of inflation obtained during the perturbative pre-bigbang era. The question of determining early-time ``attractors'' for genericpre-big bang cosmologies is also addressed, and a motivated conjecture isadvanced. We also discuss S-duality-related features of the solutions, andspeculate on the way an asymptotic T-duality symmetry may act on moduli spaceas one approaches the big bang.
