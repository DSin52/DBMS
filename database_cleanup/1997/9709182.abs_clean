We formulate criteria of applicability of the Faddeev-Popov trick to gaugetheories on manifolds with boundaries. With the example of Euclidean Maxwelltheory we demonstrate that the path integral is indeed gauge independent whenthese criteria are satisfied, and depends on a gauge choice whenever thesecriteria are violated. In the latter case gauge dependent boundary conditionsare required for a self-consistent formulation of the path intgral.
