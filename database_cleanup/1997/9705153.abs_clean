A supersymmetric theory in two-dimensions has enough data to define anoncommutative space thus making it possible to use all the tools ofnoncommutative geometry. In particular, we apply this to the N=1 supersymmetricnon-linear sigma model and derive an expression for the generalized loop spaceDirac operator, in presence of a general background, using canonicalquantization. The spectral action principle is used to show that thesuperstring partition function is also a spectral action valid for thefluctuations of the string modes.
