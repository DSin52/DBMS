When we vary the moduli of a compactification it may become entropicallyfavourable at some point for a state of branes and strings to rearrange itselfinto a new configuration. We observe that for the elementary string with twolarge charges such a rearrangement happens at the `correspondence point' wherethe string becomes a black hole. For smaller couplings it is entropicallyfavourable for the excitations to be vibrations of the string, while for largercouplings the favoured excitations are pairs of solitonic 5-branes attached tothe string; this helps resolve some recently noted difficulties with matchingemission properties of the string to emission properties of the black hole. Wealso examine the change of state when a black hole is placed in a spacetimewith an additional compact direction, and the size of this direction is varied.These studies suggest a mechanism that might help resolve the informationparadox.
