Comments: latex file, 65 pages. Work presented at CIMAF-97, Havana, Cuba,

march/97The main principles of two-dimensional quantum field theories, in particulartwo-dimensional QCD and gravity are reviewed. We study non-perturbative aspectsof these theories which make them particularly valuable for testing ideas offour-dimensional quantum field theory. The dynamics of confinement and thetavacuum are explained by using the non-perturbative methods developed in twodimensions. We describe in detail how the effective action of string theory innon-critical dimensions can be represented by Liouville gravity. By comparingthe helicity amplitudes in four-dimensional QCD to those of integrableself-dual Yang-Mills theory, we extract a four dimensional version of twodimensional integrability.
