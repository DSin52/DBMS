Title: BPS Monopoles

Comments: A 43 page review to appear in the International Journal of Modern

Physics AJournal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys. A12 (1997) 4663-4706

We review classical BPS monopoles, their moduli spaces, twistor descriptionsand dynamics. Particular emphasis is placed upon symmetric monopoles, whererecent progress has been made. Some remarks on the role of monopoles inS-duality and Seiberg-Witten theory are also made.
