Title: Functional Representations for Fock Superalgebras

Authors: Joachim Kupsch and Oleg G. Smolyanov

Comments: 33 pages, Latex

The Fock space of bosons and fermions and its underlying superalgebra arerepresented by algebras of functions on a superspace. We define Gaussianintegration on infinite dimensional superspaces, and construct superanalogs ofthe classical function spaces with a reproducing kernel -- including theBargmann-Fock representation -- and of the Wiener-Segal representation. Thelatter representation requires the investigation of Wick ordering on Z2-gradedalgebras. As application we derive a Mehler formula for the Ornstein-Uhlenbecksemigroup on the Fock space.
