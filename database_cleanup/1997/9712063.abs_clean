We consider a system of D0-branes in toroidally compactified space withinteractions described by a Born-Infeld-type generalisation of the leading v^2+ v^4/r^{D-4} terms (D is the number of non-compact directions in M-theory,including the longitudinal one). This non-linear action can be interpreted asan all-loop large N super Yang-Mills effective action and has a remarkablescaling property. We first study the classical dynamics of a brane probe in thefield of a central brane source and observe the interesting difference betweenblack hole of effective size proportional to a power of the probe energy, whilefor D=5 there is no absorption for any impact parameter. A similar dependenceon D is found in the behaviour of the Boltzmann partition function Z of anensemble of D0-branes. For D=5 (i.e. for compactification on 6-torus) Z isconvergent at short distances and is analogous to the ideal gas one. For D > 5the system has short-distance instability. For sufficiently low temperature Zis shown to describe the thermodynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole in D > 5dimensions, supporting recent discussions of black holes in Matrix theory.
