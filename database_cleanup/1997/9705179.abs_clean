We consider asymptotically flat static spherically symmetric black holesolutions in SU(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory. Embedding the N-dimensionalrepresentation of $su(2)$ in $su(N)$, the purely magnetic gauge field ansatzcontains $N-1$ functions. When one or more of these gauge field functions areidentically zero, magnetically charged EYM black hole solutions emerge,consisting of a neutral and a charged gauge field part, based on non-abeliansubalgebras and the Cartan subalgebra of $su(N)$, respectively. We classifythese charged black hole solutions in general and present numerical solutionsfor SU(5) EYM theory.
