Title: N=2, D=6 supergravity with E_7 gauge matter

Comments: 7 pages, latex

The lagrangian of N=2, D=6 supergravity coupled to E_7 X SU(2) vector- andhyper-multiplets is derived. For this purpose the coset manifold E_8/E_7 XSU(2), parametrized by the scalars of the hypermultiplet, is constructed. Adifference from the case of Sp(n)-matter is pointed out. This model can beconsidered as an intermediate step in the compactification of D=10 supergravitycoupled to E_8 X E_8 matter to four-dimensional model of E_6 unification.
