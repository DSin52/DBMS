We discuss epsilon-expansion in curved spacetime for asymptotically free andasymptotically non-free theories. The esistence of stable and unstable fixedpoints is investigated for $f \phi^4$ and SU(2) gauge theory. It is shown thatepsilon-expansion maybe compatible with asymptotic freedom on special solutionsof the RG equations in a special case (supersymmetric theory). Usingepsilon-expansion RG technique the effective Lagrangian for covariantlyconstant gauge SU(2) field and effective potential for gauged NJL-model arefound in 4-epsilon- dimensional curved space (in linear curvatureapproximation). The curvature- induced phase transitions from symmetric phaseto asymmetric phase (chromomagnetic vacuum and chiral symmetry broken phase,respectively) are discussed for the above two models.
