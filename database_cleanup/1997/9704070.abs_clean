A recursive formula for an infinity of integrals of motion for thesuper-Liouville theory is derived. The integrable boundary interactions forthis theory and the super-Toda theory based on the affine superalgebra $B^{(1)}(0,1)$ are computed. In the first case the boundary interactions areunambiguously determined by supersymmetry, whilst in the latter case there arefree parameters.
