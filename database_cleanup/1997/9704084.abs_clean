We solve the Cauchy problem for the relativistic closed string in Minkowskispace $M^{3+1}$, including the cases where the initial data has a knot liketopology. We give the general conditions for the world sheet of a closedknotted string to be a time periodic surface. In the particular case of zeroinitial string velocity the period of the world sheet is proportional to halfthe length ($\ell$) of the initial string and a knotted string always collapsesto a link for $t=\ell/4$. Relativistic closed strings are dynamically evolvingor pulsating structures in spacetime, and knotted or unknotted like structuresremain stable over time. The generation of arbitrary $n$-fold knots, startingwith an initial simple link configuration with non zero velocity is possible.
