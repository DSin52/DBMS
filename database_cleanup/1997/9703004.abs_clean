Title: Deformations of a 2D charged black hole

Comments: 12 pages, latex, no figures

We discuss two types of deformations of a 2D black hole carrying an electriccharge. Type I gives rise to a space-time configuration similar to the onedescribed by McGuigan, Nappi and Yost. Whereas type II results in a space-timeconfiguration which has a rather peculiar geometry.
