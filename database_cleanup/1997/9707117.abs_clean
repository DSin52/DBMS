Title: Physical states of dyons

Authors: Marcos Alvarez

Comments: 9 pages, no figures

It is shown that physical states of a non-abelian Yang-Mills-Higgs dyon areinvariant under large gauge transformations that do not commute with itsmagnetic field. This result is established within an enlarged Hamiltonianformalism where surface terms are kept as dynamical variables. These additionalvariables are parameters of large gauge transformations, and are potentialcollective coordinates for the quantization of the monopole. Our result impliesthat there are no physical effects associated to some large gaugetransformations and therefore their parameters should not be counted ascollective coordinates.
