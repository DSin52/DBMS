The hierarchy of equations of motion for equal-time Green functions intemporal gauge SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is truncated using an expansion in termsof connected Green functions. A second hierarchy of constraint equations arisesfrom Gauss law and can be truncated in a similar way. Within this approximationscheme we investigate SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on a torus in 2+1 spacetimedimensions in a finite basis of plane wave states and focus on infrared andultraviolet properties of the approach. We study the consequences of restoringthe hierarchy of Gauss law constraints and of different momentum cutoffs forthe 2- and the 3-point functions. In all truncation schemes considered up tothe 4-point level the connected Green function approach is found to be UVdivergent and either violating gauge invariance and/or energy conservation. Theproblems associated with adiabatically generating a perturbed ground state arediscussed as well.
