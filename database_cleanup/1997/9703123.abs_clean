A supersymmetric Yang-Mills system in (11,3) dimensions is constructed withthe aid of two mutually orthogonal null vectors which naturally arise in ageneralized spacetime superalgebra. An obstacle encountered in an attempt toextend this result to beyond 14 dimensions is described. A null reduction ofthe (11,3) model is shown to yield the known super Yang-Mills model in (10,2)dimensions. An (8,8) supersymmetric super Yang-Mills system in (3,3) dimensionsis obtained by an ordinary dimensional reduction of the (11,3) model, and it issuggested there may exist a superbrane with (3,3) dimensional worldvolumepropagating in (11,3) dimensions.
