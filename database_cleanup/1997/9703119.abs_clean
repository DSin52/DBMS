The Hamiltonian structure of spin generalization of the rationalRuijsenaars-Schneider model is found by using the Hamiltonian reductiontechnique. It is shown that the model possesses the current algebra symmetry.The possibility of generalizing the found Poisson structure to thetrigonometric case is discussed and degeneration to the Euler-Calogero-Mosersystem is examined.
