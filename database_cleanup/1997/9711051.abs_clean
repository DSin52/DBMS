Title: A note on the interactions of compactified D-branes

Authors: Alec Matusis

Comments: 5 pages, LaTex, 2 eps figures

We compute the vacuum one loop amplitude for two D-strings at an anglecompactified on $T^2$ as a function of the transverse separation and thewinding numbers. We show that in certain cases the amplitude is independent onwhether the D-strings are compactified or not.
