The statistical mechanics of black holes arbitrarily far from extremality ismodeled by a gas of weakly interacting strings. As an effective low energydescription of black holes the model provides a number of highly non-trivialconsistency checks and predictions. Speculations on a fundamental origin of themodel suggest surprising simplifications in non-perturbative string theory,even in the absence of supersymmetry.
