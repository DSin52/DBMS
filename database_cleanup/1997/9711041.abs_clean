Title: On an integrable reduction of the Dirac equation

Authors: Renat Zhdanov (Institute of Mathematics, Kyiv)

Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX

A symmetry reduction of the Dirac equation is shown to yield the system ofordinary differential equations whose integrability by quadratures is closelyconnected to the stationary mKdV hierarchy.
