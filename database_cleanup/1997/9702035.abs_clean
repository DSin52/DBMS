Yang-Mills theory in the first order formalism appears as the deformation ofa topological field theory, the pure BF theory. We discuss this formulation atthe quantum level, giving the Feynman rules of the BF-YM theory, the structureof the renormalization and checking its uv-behaviour in the computation of thebeta-function which agrees with the expected result.
