A systematical description of possible symmetry breakings in the SO(3) gaugetheory and an algorithmical method to construct SU(2) or SO(3) invariant Higgspotentials in an arbitrary irreducible representation is given. We close ourpaper with the explicit construction of the Lagrangian of the simplest SO(3)theory violated to its subgroup A_4.
