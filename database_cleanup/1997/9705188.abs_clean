Title: Higher Loop Effects in M(atrix) Orbifolds

Comments: Discussion of the discrepancy with M(atrix)-theory is clarified. We

emphasize the fact that the main problem is not a numerical one but in thefactors of N. We also made minor corrections to the text, 24pp TeXJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B511 (1998) 243-263

Scattering of zero branes off the fixed point in $R^8/Z_2$, as described by asuper-quantum mechanics with eight supercharges, displays some novel effectsrelevant to Matrix theory in non-compact backgrounds. The leading long distancebehaviour of the moduli space metric receives no correction at one loop inMatrix theory, but does receive a correction at two loops. There are nocontributions at higher loops. We explicitly calculate the two-loop term,finding a non-zero result. We find a discrepancy with M(atrix)-theory. Althoughthe result has the right dependence on $v$ and $b$ for the scattering of zerobranes off the fixed point the factors of $N$ do not match. We also discussscattering in the orbifolds, $R^5/Z_2$ and $R^9/Z_2$ where we find thepredicted fractional charges.
