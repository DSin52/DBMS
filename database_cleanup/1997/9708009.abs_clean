We review aspects of N=2 duality between the heterotic and the type IIAstring. After a description of string duality intended for the non-specialistthe computation of the heterotic prepotential and the $F_1$ function for theST, STU and STUV model (V a Wilson line) and the matching with the Calabi-Yauinstanton expansions are given in detail. Relations with BPS spectral sums invarious connections are pointed out.
