Charged BPS hypermultiplets can develop a non-trivial self-interaction in theCoulomb branch of an N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory, whereas neutral BPShypermultiplets in the Higgs branch may also have a non-trivialself-interaction in the presence of Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. The exacthypermultiplet low-energy effective action (LEEA) takes the form of thenon-linear sigma-model (NLSM) with a hyper-K"ahler metric. A non-trivial scalarpotential is also quantum-mechanically generated at non-vanishing centralcharges, either perturbatively (Coulomb branch), or non-perturbatively (Higgsbranch). We calculate the effective scalar potentials for (i) a single chargedhypermultiplet in the Coulomb branch and (ii) a single neutral hypermultipletin the Higgs branch. The first case corresponds to the NLSM with the Taub-NUT(or KK-monopole) metric for the kinetic LEEA, whereas the second one isattached to the NLSM having the Eguchi-Hanson instanton metric.
