The motivation and the challenge in applying the renormalization group forsystems with several scaling regimes is briefly outlined. The four dimensional$\phi^4$ model serves as an example where a nontrivial low energy scalingregime is identified in the vicinity of the spinodal instability region. It ispointed out that the effective theory defined in the vicinity of the spinodalinstability offers an amplification mechanism, a precursor of the condensationthat can be used to explore nonuniversal forces at high energies.
