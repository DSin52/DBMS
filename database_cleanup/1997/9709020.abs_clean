We analyze the gauge symmetry of a topological mass generating action in fourdimensions which contains both a vector and a second rank antisymmetric tensorfields. In the Abelian case, this system induces an effective mass for thevector gauge field via a topological coupling $B \wedge F$ in the presence of akinetic term for the antisymmetric tensor field $B$, while maintaining a gaugesymmetry. On the other hand, for the non-Abelian case the $B$ field does nothave a gauge symmetry unless an auxiliary vector field is introduced to thesystem. We analyze this change of symmetry in the Faddeev-Jackiw formalism, andshow how the auxiliary vector field enhances the symmetry. At the same timethis enhanced gauge symmetry becomes reducible. We also show this phenomenon inthis analysis.
