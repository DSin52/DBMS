The universal hypermultiplet arises as a subsector of every Calabi-Yaucompactification of M-theory or Type II string theory. Classically its modulispace is the quaternionic space $SU(2,1)/U(2)$. We show that this moduli spacereceives a one-loop correction proportional to the Euler character of theCalabi-Yau, which can locally be absorbed by a certain constant shift of thefields. The correction vanishes in the limit that the Planck mass is taken toinfinity, and hence is essentially gravitational in nature.
