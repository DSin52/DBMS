Kadanoff's "correlations along a line" in the critical two-dimensional Isingmodel (1969) are reconsidered. They are the analytical aspect of arepresentation of abelian chiral vertex operators as quadratic polynomials, inthe sense of operator valued distributions, in non-abelian exchange fields.This basic result has interesting applications to conformal coset models. Italso gives a new explanation for the remarkable relation between the "doubled"critical Ising model and the free massless Dirac theory. As a consequence,analogous properties as for the Ising model order/disorder fields with respectboth to doubling and to restriction along a line are established for thetwo-dimensional local fields with chiral level 2 SU(2) symmetry.
