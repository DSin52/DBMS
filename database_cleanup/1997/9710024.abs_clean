The structure of the moduli space of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories isanalyzed from an algebraic geometric viewpoint. The connection between thefundamental fields of the ultraviolet theory, and the gauge invariant compositefields of the infrared theory is explained in detail. The results are then usedto prove an anomaly matching theorem. The theorem is used to study anomalymatching for supersymmetric QCD, and can explain all the known anomaly matchingresults for this case.
