Title: Entropy of bound states in the matrix description of M5-branes

Comments: 13 pages, Latex

Like the M-theory itself also the worldvolume theory of the M5-brane containsbrane excitations, which can be extracted from the supersymmetry algebra. Boundstates (intersecting branes) of the worldvolume can be translated into boundstates of {11-d} SUGRA. In this paper, we discuss the matrix description forthese bound states and their entropy (=degeneracy). In order to decouple theworldvolume field theory from the bulk gravity we have especially to assumethat all charges are large, which gives a nice agreement with theBekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes.
