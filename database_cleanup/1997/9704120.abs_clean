We consider intersections in eleven dimensions involving Kaluza-Kleinmonopoles and Brinkmann waves. Besides these purely gravitationalconfigurations we also construct solutions to the equations of motion thatinvolve additional M2- and M5-branes. The maximal number of independent objectsin these intersections is nine, and such maximal configurations, when reducedto two dimensions, give rise to a 0-brane solution with dilaton couplinga=-4/9.
