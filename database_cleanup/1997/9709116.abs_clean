Using linearized superfields, $R^4$ terms in the Type II superstringeffective action compactified on $T^2$ are constructed as integrals in N=2 D=8superspace. The structure of these superspace integrals allows a simple proofof the $R^4$ non-renormalization theorems which were first conjectured by Greenand Gutperle.
