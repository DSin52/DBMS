It has been pointed out that Nielsen-Olesen vortices may be able to decay bypair production of black holes. We show that when the abelian Higgs model isembedded in a larger theory, the additional fields may lead to selection rulesfor this process - even in the absence of fermions - due to the failure of acharge quantization condition. We show that, when there is topology change, thecriterion based on the charge quantization condition supplements the usualcriterion based on $\pi_0(H)$. In particular, we find that, unless$2\sin^2\theta_W$ is a rational number, the thermal splitting of electroweakZ-strings by magnetically neutral black holes is impossible, even though$\pi_0(H)$ is trivial.
