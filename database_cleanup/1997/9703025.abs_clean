107-122The new class of integrable mappings and chains is introduced. Corresponding(1+2) integrable systems invariant with respect to such discretetransformations are represented in explicit form. Soliton like solutions ofthem are represented in terms of matrix elements of fundamental representationsof semisimple A_n algebras for a given group element.
