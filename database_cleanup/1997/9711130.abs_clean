Type IIB string theory admits a BPS configuration in which three strings (ofdifferent type) meet at a point. Using this three string configuration weconstruct a string network and study its properties. In particular we provesupersymmetry of this configuration. We also consider string lattices, whichcan be used to construct BPS states in toroidally compactified string theory.
