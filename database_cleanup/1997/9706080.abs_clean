We show that the one-dimensional projection of Chern-Simons gauged NonlinearSchrodinger model is equivalent to an Abelian gauge field theory of continuumHeisenberg spin chain. In such a theory, the matter field has geometricalmeaning of coordinates in tangent plane to the spin phase space, while the U(1)gauge symmetry relates to rotation in the plane. This allows us to constructthe infinite hierarchy of integrable gauge theories and corresponding magneticmodels. To each of them a U(1) invariant gauge fixing constraint of non-AbelianBF theory is derived. The corresponding moving frames hierarchy is obtained andthe spectral parameter is interpreted as a constant-valued statistical gaugepotential constrained by the 1-cocycle condition.
