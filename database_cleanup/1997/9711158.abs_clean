We provide a simple macroscopic analysis of the four-dimensional effectivesupergravity of the Ho\v{r}ava-Witten M-theory which is expanded in powers of$\kappa^{2/3}/\rho V^{1/3}$ and $\kappa^{2/3}\rho/V^{2/3}$ where $\kappa^2$,$V$ and $\rho$ denote the eleven-dimensional gravitational coupling, theCalabi-Yau volume and the eleventh length respectively. Possible higher orderterms in the K\"ahler potential are identified and matched with the heteroticstring corrections. In the context of this M-theory expansion, we analyze thesoft supersymmetry-breaking terms under the assumption that supersymmetry isspontaneously broken by the auxiliary components of the bulk modulisuperfields. It is examined how the pattern of soft terms changes when onemoves from the weakly coupled heterotic string limit to the M-theory limit.
