We examine some six-dimensional orientifold models with $N = 1$supersymmetry, which can be realised as intersecting 7-branes and 7-planes.These models are studied in the light of recent work showing that orientifoldplanes carry anomalous gravitational couplings on their world-volume. We showthat gravitational anomalies can be locally cancelled by these new couplings atevery point in the internal space, under the assumption that the anomalyresiding on orientifold planes is distributed in a particular way amongbrane-plane and plane-plane intersections.
