We suggest a generalization of the Lie algebraic approach for constructingquasi-exactly solvable one-dimensional Schroedinger equations which is due toShifman and Turbiner in order to include into consideration matrix models. Thisgeneralization is based on representations of Lie algebras by first-ordermatrix differential operators. We have classified inequivalent representationsof the Lie algebras of the dimension up to three by first-order matrixdifferential operators in one variable. Next we describe invariantfinite-dimensional subspaces of the representation spaces of the one-,two-dimensional Lie algebras and of the algebra sl(2,R). These results enableconstructing multi-parameter families of first- and second-order quasi-exactlysolvable models. In particular, we have obtained two classes of quasi-exactlysolvable matrix Schroedinger equations.
