Title: Algebraic Constraint Quantization and the Pseudo-Rigid Body

Comments: 23 pages, Latex2.09; contains a new section with a self-contained

presentation of the algebraic constraint quantization schemeThe pseudo--rigid body represents an example of a constrained system with anonunimodular gauge group. This system is treated along the guidelines of analgebraic constraint quantization scheme which focusses on observablequantities, translating the vanishing of the constraints into representationconditions on the algebra of observables. The constraint which is responsiblefor the nonunimodularity of the gauge group is shown not to contribute to theobservable content of the constraints, i.e., not to impose any restrictions onthe construction of the quantum theory of the system. The application of thealgebraic constraint quantization scheme yields a unique quantization of thephysical degrees of freedom, which are shown to form a realization of theso-called CM(N) model of collective motions.
