An efficient way of resolving Gauss' law in Yang-Mills theory is presented bystarting from the projected gauge invariant partition function and integratingout one spatial field variable. In this way one obtains immediately thedescription in terms of unconstrained gauge invariant variables which waspreviously obtained by explicitly resolving Gauss' law in a modified axialgauge. In this gauge, which is a variant of 't Hooft's Abelian gauges, magneticmonopoles occur. It is shown how the Pontryagin index of the gauge field isrelated to the magnetic charges. It turns out that the magnetic monopoles aresufficient to account for the non-trivial topological structure of the theory.
