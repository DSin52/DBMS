Title: Exact Two-Point Correlation Functions of Turbulence Without Pressure in

Three-DimensionsAuthors: A. R. Rastegar, M. R. Rahimi Tabar and P. Hawaii

Comments: 9 pages, latex, no figures, we have corrected the our basic

equations. We predict the inertial-range exponent for the energy spectrum for3D-turbulence without pressure. We will present the detail of calculation andthe results for 2D-turbulence elsewhere. Also some references are addedWe investigate exact results of isotropic turbulence in three-dimensions whenthe pressure gradient is negligible. We derive exact two-point correlationfunctions of density in three-dimensions and show that the density-densitycorrelator behaves as $ |{x_1 - x_2}|^{-\alpha_3}$, where $\alpha_3 = 2 +\frac{\sqrt{33}}{6}$. It is shown that, in three-dimensions, the energyspectrum $E(k)$ in the inertial range scales with exponent $ 2 - \frac{\sqrt{33}}{12} \simeq 1.5212$. We also discuss the time scale for which ourexact results are valid for strong 3D--turbulence in the presence of thepressure. We confirm our predictions by using the recent results of numericalcalculations and experiment.
