We apply the principles of discrete time mechanics discussed in earlierpapers to the first and second quantised Dirac equation. We use the Schwingeraction principle to find the anticommutation relations of the Dirac field andof the particle creation operators in the theory. We find new solutions to thediscrete time Dirac equation, referred to as oscillons on account of theirextraordinary behaviour. Their principal characteristic is that they oscillatewith a period twice that of the fundamental time interval T of our theory.Although these solutions can be associated with definite charge, linearmomentum and spin, such objects should not be observable as particles in thecontinuous time limit. We find that for non-zero T they correspond to stateswith negative squared norm in Hilbert space. However they are an integral partof the discrete time Dirac field and should play a role in particleinteractions analogous to the role of longitudinal photons in conventionalquantum electrodynamics.
