Title: Hamiltonian analysis of gauged CP^1 model, with or without Hopf term,

and fractional spinComments: 18 pages, Latex

Recently it has been shown by Cho and Kimm that the gauged $CP^1$ model,obtained by gauging the global SU(2) group of $CP^1$ model and adding acorresponding Chern-Simons term, has got its own soliton. These solitons aresomewhat distinct from those of pure $CP^1$ model, as they cannot always becharacterised by $\pi_2(CP^1)=Z$. In this paper, we first carry out theHamiltonian analysis of this gauged $CP^1$ model. Then we couple the Hopf term,associated to these solitons and again carry out its Hamiltonian analysis. Thesymplectic structures, along with the structures of the constraints, of thesetwo models (with or without Hopf term) are found to be essentially the same.The model with Hopf term, is then shown to have fractional spin, which howeverdepends not only on the soliton number $N$ but also on the nonabelian charge.
