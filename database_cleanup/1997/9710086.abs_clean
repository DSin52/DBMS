Physics, July 13-19, 1997, in Brisbane, Australia, and the SecondInternational Conference on Quantum Field Theory and Gravity, July 29 -August 2, 1997, in Tomsk, Russia; 8 pages, LaTeXThe effective field equations of motion for a mixed theory of open and closed(2,2) world-sheet supersymmetric critical strings are shown to be integrable inthe case of an abelian gauge group. The Born-Infeld-type effective action in2+2 dimensions is intrinsically non-covariant, and it can be interpreted as (apart of) the F-brane world-volume action. The covariant F-brane action isunambiguously restored by its maximal (N=8) world-volume supersymmetry. The 32supercharges, the local SO(2,1) x SO(8) and rigid SL(2,R) symmetries of theF-brane action naturally suggest its interpretation as the hypothetical(non-covariant) self-dual `heterotic' (1,0) supergravity in 2+10 dimensions.
