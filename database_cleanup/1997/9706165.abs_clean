It has been shown recently that the toroidally compactified type IIB stringeffective action possesses an SL(2, R) invariance. Using this symmetry weconstruct an infinite family of macroscopic string-like solutions permuted bySL(2, Z) group for type II superstrings in $4 \leq D < 10$. These solutions,which formally look very similar to the corresponding solutions in $D = 10$,are characterized by two relatively prime integers corresponding to the`electric' charges associated with the two antisymmetric tensor fields of thestrings. Stability of these solutions is discussed briefly in the light ofcharge conservation and the tension gap equation.
