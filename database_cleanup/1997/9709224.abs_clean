We study the quantum evolution of black holes immersed in a de Sitterbackground space. For black holes whose size is comparable to that of thecosmological horizon, this process differs significantly from the evaporationof asymptotically flat black holes. Our model includes the one-loop effectiveaction in the s-wave and large N approximation. Black holes of the maximal massare in equilibrium. Unexpectedly, we find that nearly maximal quantumSchwarzschild-de Sitter black holes anti-evaporate. However, there is adifferent perturbative mode that leads to evaporation. We show that this modewill always be excited when a pair of cosmological holes nucleates.
