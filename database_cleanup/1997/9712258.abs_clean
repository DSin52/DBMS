Many qualitatively new features of WZNW models associated to noncompactcosets are due to zero modes with continuous spectrum. Insight may be gained byreducing the theory to its zero-mode sector, the mini-superspace limit. Thiswill be discussed in some detail for the example of SL(2,C)/SU(2)-WZNW model.The mini-superspace limit of this model can be formulated as baby-CFT.Spectrum, structure constants and fusion rules as well as factorization of fourpoint functions are obtained from the harmonic analysis on SL(2,C)/SU(2). Theissues of operator-state correspondence or the appearance of non-normalizableintermediate states in correlation functions can be discussed transparently inthis context.
