(1998) 3-16We present a review of heterotic-type I string duality. In particular, wediscuss the effective field theory of six- and four-dimensionalcompactifications with N>1 supersymmetries. We then describe various dualitytests by comparing gauge couplings, N=2 prepotentials, as well asWinter School of Theoretical Physics ``Duality, Strings and Fields,''Przesieka, Poland, 13 - 22 February 1997; Trieste Conference on DualitySymmetries in String Theory, Trieste, Italy, 1 - 4 April 1997; Cargese SummerSchool ``Strings, Branes and Dualities,'' Cargese, France, 26 May - 14 June1997.
