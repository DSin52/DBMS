The Stueckelberg model for massive vector fields is cast into a BRSinvariant, polynomial form. Its symmetry algebra simplifies to an abelian gaugesymmetry which is sufficient to decouple the negative norm states. Thepropagators fall off like $1/k^2$ and the Lagrangean is polynomial but it isnot powercounting renormalizable due to derivative couplings.
