We construct a generalization of the two-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten modelon a $2n$-dimensional K\"ahler manifold as a group-valued non-linear sigmamodel with an anomaly term containing the K\"ahler form. The model is shown tohave an infinite-dimensional symmetry which generates an $n$-toroidal Liealgebra. The classical equation of motion turns out to be theDonaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau equation, which is a $2n$-dimensional generalization ofthe self-dual Yang-Mills equation.
