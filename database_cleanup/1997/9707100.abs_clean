We describe two distinct approaches for bosonization in higher dimensions;one is based on a direct comparison of current correlation functions while theother relies on a Master lagrangean formalism. These are used to bosonise theMassive Thirring Model in three and four dimensions in the weak coupling regimebut with an arbitrary fermion mass. In both approaches the explicit bosonisedlagrangean and current are derived in terms of gauge fields. The completeequivalence of the two bosonization methods is established. Exact results forthe free massive fermion theory are also obtained. Finally, the two-dimensionaltheory is revisited and the possibility of extending this analysis forarbitrary dimensions is indicated.
