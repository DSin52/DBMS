We study the D-brane solutions to type IIB superstring in ten dimensions andfind interpretation in terms of compactification of a twelve dimensionalthree-brane of (a specific) F-theory on a torus $T^2$. In this frame-work,there also exist a two-brane which may be argued to be equivalent to thethree-brane by utilizing the electric-magnetic duality in eleven dimensions. Inthis context, we propose for the existence of an isometry in one of thetransverse directions to the three-brane in F-theory. As a consequence thetwo-brane may be identified with the three-brane in twelve dimensions itself.The twelve dimensional picture of D-branes in type IIB theory suggests for thereformulation of type IIB superstring in terms of three-brane of F-theory.
