The heat kernel associated with an elliptic second-order partial differentialoperator of Laplace type acting on smooth sections of a vector bundle over aRiemannian manifold, is studied. A general manifestly covariant method forcomputation of the coefficients of the heat kernel asymptotic expansion isdeveloped. The technique enables one to compute explicitly the diagonal valuesof the heat kernel coefficients, so called Hadamard-Minackshisundaram-DeWitt-Seeley coefficients, as well as their derivatives. The elaboratedtechnique is applicable for a manifold of arbitrary dimension and for a genericRiemannian metric of arbitrary signature. It is very algorithmic, and wellsuited to automated computation. The fourth heat kernel coefficient is computedexplicitly for the first time. The general structure of the heat kernelcoefficients is investigated in detail. On the one hand, the leading derivativeterms in all heat kernel coefficients are computed. On the other hand, thegenerating functions in closed covariant form for the covariantly constantterms and some low-derivative terms in the heat kernel coefficients areconstructed by means of purely algebraic methods. This gives, in particular,the whole sequence of heat kernel coefficients for an arbitrary locallysymmetric space.
