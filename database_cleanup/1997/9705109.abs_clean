Title: Lie-Algebraic Characterization of 2D (Super-)Integrable Models

Comments: 6 pages, LaTex, Talk given at the conference in memory of D.V.

Volkov, Kharkhov, January 1997. To appear in the proceedingsIt is pointed out that affine Lie algebras appear to be the naturalmathematical structure underlying the notion of integrability fortwo-dimensional systems. Their role in the construction and classification of2D integrable systems is discussed. The super- symmetric case will beparticularly enphasized. The fundamental examples will be outlined.
