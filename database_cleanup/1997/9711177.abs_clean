A geometrical analysis is given of Dirichlet fourbrane creation, whensixbrane crosses fivebrane in M-theory. A special property of the Taub-NUTspace leads to the consequence. When brane configurations are considered forfour dimensional N=2 field theories, sixbrane contributes to the beta-functionthrough the Dirac string of the Taub-NUT space.
