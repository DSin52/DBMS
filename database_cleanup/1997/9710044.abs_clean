The effect of topology on the thermodynamics of a gas of adjointrepresentation charges interacting via 1+1 dimensional SU(N) gauge fields isinvestigated. We demonstrate explicitly the existence of multiple vacuaparameterized by the discrete superselection variable k=1,...,N. In the lowpressure limit, the k dependence of the adjoint gas equation of state iscalculated and shown to be non-trivial. Conversely, in the limit of high systempressure, screening by the adjoint charges results in an equation of stateindependent of k. Additionally, the relation of this model to adjoint QCD atfinite temperature in two dimensions and the limit of large N are discussed.
