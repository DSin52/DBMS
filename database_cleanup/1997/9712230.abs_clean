We discuss the ``fractional D-branes'' which arise in orbifold resolution. Weargue that they arise as subsectors of the Coulomb branch of the quiver gaugetheory used to describe both string theory D-brane and Matrix theory on anorbifold, and thus must form part of the full physical Hilbert space. We makefurther observations confirming their interpretation as wrapped membranes.
