We compute the microscopic entropy of certain 4 and 5 dimensional extermalblack holes which arise for compactification of M-theory and type IIA onCalabi-Yau 3-folds. The results agree with macroscopic predictions, includingsome subleading terms. The macroscopic entropy in the 5 dimensional casepredicts a surprising growth in the cohomology of moduli space of holomorphiccurves in Calabi-Yau threefolds which we verify in the case of ellipticthreefolds.
