We discuss three dimensional compact QED with a theta term due to an axionicfield. The variational gauge invariant functional is considered and it is shownthat the ground state energy is independent of theta in a leadingapproximation. The mass gap of the axionic field is found to be dependent upontheta, the mass gap of the photon field and the scalar potential. The vacuumexpectation of the Wilson loop is shown to be independent of theta in a leadingapproximation, to obey the area law and to lead to confinement. We also brieflydiscuss the properties of axionic confining strings.
