We start with BPS-saturated configurations of two (orthogonally) intersectingM-branes and use the electro-magnetic duality or dimensional reduction along aboost, in order to obtain new p-brane bound states. In the first case theresulting configurations are interpreted as BPS-saturated non-threshold boundstates of intersecting p-branes, and in the second case as p-branesintersecting at angles and their duals. As a by-product we deduce theenhancement of supersymmetry as the angle approaches zero. We also comment onthe D-brane theory describing these new bound states, and a connection betweenthe angle and the world-volume gauge fields of the D-brane system. We use theseconfigurations to find new embeddings of the four and five dimensional blackholes with non-zero entropy, whose entropy now also depends on the angle andworld-volume gauge fields. The corresponding D-brane configuration sheds lighton the microscopic entropy of such black holes.
