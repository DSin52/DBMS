We present an arbitrary model based on the trefoil knot to construct objectsof the same spectrum as that of elementary particles. It includes `waves' andthree identical sets of sources. Due to Lorentz invariance, `waves' group into3 types of 1, 3 and 8 objects and `sources' consists of 3 identical sets of2 + 3 * 1 * 2 and another 1 * 1 * 2 group (which does not match classificationof the Standard Model fields). On the other hand, there is no room in thisconstruction for objects directly corresponding to Higgs-like degrees offreedom.
