We study an orientifold of the solitonic fivebrane of type II string theory.The consideration is restricted to a space-time domain which can be describedby an exact conformal field theory. There are no IR divergent contributions totadpole diagrams and thus no consistency conditions arise. However,extrapolating the results to spatial infinity leads to consistency conditionsimplying that there are four (physical) D-6-branes sitting at each of the twoorientifold fixed planes.
