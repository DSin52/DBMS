The recently proposed ``correspondence principle'' of Horowitz and Polchinskiprovides a concrete means to relate (among others) black holes with electricNS-NS charges to fundamental strings and correctly match their entropies. Wetest further this correspondence by examining the greybody factors in theabsorption rates of neutral, minimally coupled scalars by a near extremal blackhole. Perhaps surprisingly, the results disagree in general with the absorptionby weakly coupled strings. Though this does not disprove the correspondence, itindicates that it might not be simple in this region of the black holeparameter space.
