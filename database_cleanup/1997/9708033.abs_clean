We apply stochastic quantization method to real symmetric matrix-vectormodels for the second quantization of non-orientable strings, including bothopen and closed strings. The Fokker-Planck hamiltonian deduces a well-definednon-orientable open-closed string field theory at the double scaling limit ofthe matrix model. There appears a new algebraic structure in the continuum F-Phamiltonian including a Virasoro algebra and a $SO(r)$ current algebra.
