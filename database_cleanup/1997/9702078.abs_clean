Within the framework of "anomalously gauged" Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models,we construct solutions which include nonabelian fields. Both compact andnoncompact groups are discussed. In the case of compact groups, as an exampleof background containing nonabelian fields, we discuss conformal theory on the$SO(4)/SO(3)$ coset, which is the natural generalization of the 2D monopoletheory corresponding to the $SO(3)/SO(2)$ coset. In noncompact case, weconsider examples with $SO(2,1)/SO(1,1)$ and $SO(3,2)/SO(3,1)$ cosets.
