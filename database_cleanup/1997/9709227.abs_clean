A set of new canonical variables for $d=11$ supergravity is proposed whichrenders the supersymmetry variations and the supersymmetry constraintpolynomial. The construction is based on the $SO(1,2)\times SO(16)$ invariantreformulation of $d=11$ supergravity given in previous work, and has somesimilarities with Ashtekar's reformulation of Einstein's theory. The newbosonic variables fuse the gravitational degrees of freedom with those of thethree-index photon $A_{MNP}$ in accordance with the hidden symmetries of thedimensionally reduced theory. Although $E_8$ is not a symmetry of the theory,the bosonic sector exhibits a remarkable $E_8$ structure, hinting at theexistence of a novel type of ``exceptional geometry''.
