Title: U Duality, Solvable Lie Algebras and Extremal Black-Holes

Meeting of the Italian Society for General Relativity (SIGRAV) on theoccasion of Prof. Bruno Bertotti's 65th birthday. Rome September 1996In this lecture I review recent results on the use of Solvable Lie Algebrasas an efficient description of the scalar field sector of supergravities inrelation with their non perturbative structure encoded in the U-duality group.I also review recent results on the construction of BPS saturated states assolution of the first differential equations following from imposingpreservation of a fraction of the original supersymmetries. In particular Idiscuss N=2 extremal black holes that are approximated by a Bertotti Robinsonmetric near their horizon. The extension of this construction to maximallyextended supergravities in all dimensions from 4 to 11 is work in progresswhere the use of the Solvable Lie algebra approach promises to be of decisiveusefulness.
