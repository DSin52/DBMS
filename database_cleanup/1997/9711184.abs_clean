We study the exact equivalence between the self-dual model minimally coupledwith a Dirac field and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model with non-minimal magneticcoupling to fermions. We show that the fermion sectors of the models areequivalent only if a Thirring like interaction is included. Using functionalmethods we verify that, up to renormalizations, the equivalence persists at thequantum level.
