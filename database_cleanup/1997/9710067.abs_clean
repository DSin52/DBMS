An ambiguity inherent in the partial integration procedure leading to theBern-Kosower rules is fixed in a way which preserves the complete permutationsymmetry in the scattering states. This leads to a canonical version of theBern-Kosower representation for the one-loop N - photon/gluon amplitudes, andto a natural decomposition of those amplitudes into permutation symmetric gaugeinvariant partial amplitudes. This decomposition exhibits a simple recursivestructure.
