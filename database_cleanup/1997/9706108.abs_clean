We present a new, alternative interpretation of the vector-tensor multipletas a 2-form in central charge superspace. This approach provides a geometricdescription of the (non-trivial) central charge transformations ab initio andis naturally generalized to include couplings of Chern-Simons forms to theantisymmetric tensor gauge field, giving rise to a N=2 supersymmetric versionof the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism.
