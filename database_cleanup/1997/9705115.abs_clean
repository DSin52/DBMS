Title: On the black hole unitarity issue

Comments: 14 pages, latex, no figures. Talk presented at the Puri workshop

(December 1996)I discuss features required for preserving unitarity in black hole decay andconcepts underlying such a perspective. Unitarity requires that correlationsextend on the scale of the horizon. I show, in a toy model inspired by stringtheories, that such correlations can indeed arise. The model suggests that,after a time of order 4M ln M following the onset of Hawking radiation, quantumeffects could maintain throughout the decay a collapsing star within a Planckdistance of its Schwarzschild radius. In this way information loss would beavoided. The concept of black hole ``complementarity'', which could reconcilethese macroscopic departures from classical physics with the equivalenceprinciple, is interpreted in terms of weak values of quantum operators.
