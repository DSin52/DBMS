In this article we will examine a "generalized topological sigma model." Thisso-called "generalized topological sigma model" is the M-Theoretic analog ofthe standard topological sigma model of string theory. We find that theobservables of the theory are elements in the cohomology ring of the modulispace of supersymmetric maps; in addition, we find that the correlationfunctions of such observables allow us to compute non-perturbative correctionsto the four-fermion terms present in M-Theory on a six-dimensional Calabi-Yau.
