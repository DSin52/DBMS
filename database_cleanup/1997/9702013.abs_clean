Reflection equation for the scattering of lines moving in half-plane isobtained. The corresponding geometric picture is related with configurations ofhalf-planes touching the boundary plane in 2+1 dimensions. This equation can beobtained as an additional to the tetrahedron equation consistency condition fora modified Zamolodchikov algebra.
