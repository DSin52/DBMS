We study algebro-geometric (finite-gap) and elliptic solutions of fullydiscretized KP or 2D Toda equations. In bilinear form they are Hirota'sdifference equation for $\tau$-functions. Starting from a given algebraiccurve, we express the $\tau$-function and the Baker-Akhiezer function in termsof the Riemann theta function. We show that the elliptic solutions, when the$\tau$-function is an elliptic polynomial, form a subclass of the generalalgebro-geometric solutions. We construct the algebraic curves of the ellipticsolutions. The evolution of zeros of the elliptic solutions is governed by thediscrete time generalization of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider many body system. Thezeros obey equations which have the form of nested Bethe-Ansatz equations,known from integrable quantum field theories. We discuss the Lax representationand the action-angle-type variables for the many body system. We also discusselliptic solutions to discrete analogues of KdV, sine-Gordon and 1D Todaequations and describe the loci of the zeros.
