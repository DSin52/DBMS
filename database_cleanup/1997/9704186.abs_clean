We present four-dimensional M-theory vacua with N>0 supersymmetry which, fromthe perspective of perturbative Type IIA string theory, have N=0. Such vacuacan appear when the compactifying 7-manifold is a U(1) fibration. The missingsuperpartners are Dirichlet 0-branes. Someone unable to detect Ramond-Ramondcharge would thus conclude that these worlds have no unbroken supersymmetry. Inparticular, the gravitinos (and also some of the gauge bosons) are 0-branes notseen in perturbation theory but which curiously remain massless however weakthe string coupling.
