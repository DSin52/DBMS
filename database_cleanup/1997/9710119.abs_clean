We analyse the global (rigid) symmetries that are realised on the bosonicfields of the various supergravity actions obtained from eleven-dimensionalsupergravity by toroidal compactification followed by the dualisation of somesubset of fields. In particular, we show how the global symmetries of theaction can be affected by the choice of this subset. This phenomenon occurseven with the global symmetries of the equations of motion. A strikingregularity is exhibited by the series of theories obtained respectively withoutany dualisation, with the dualisation of only the Ramond-Ramond fields of thetype IIA theory, with full dualisation to lowest degree forms, and finally forcertain inverse dualisations (increasing the degrees of some forms) to give thetype IIB series. These theories may be called the GL_A, D, E and GL_B seriesrespectively. It turns out that the scalar Lagrangians of the E series aresigma models on the symmetric spaces K(E_{11-D})\backslash E_{11-D} (where K(G)is the maximal compact subgroup of G) and the other three series lead to modelson homogeneous spaces K(G) \backslash G\semi \R^s. These can be understood fromthe E series in terms of the deletion of positive roots associated with thedualised scalars, which implies a group contraction. We also propose aconstrained Lagrangian version of the even dimensional theories exhibiting thefull duality symmetry and begin a systematic analysis of abelian dualitysubalgebras.
