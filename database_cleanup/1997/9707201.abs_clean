to the proceedings of the conference "Quantum Groups, Deformations andContractions" Istanbul 1997, to be published in Turkish Journal of Physics.Title changed in journal to "The Quantum Poincare' Group as Hidden Symmetryof General Relativity"Using the tools of q--differential calculus and quantum Lie algebrasassociated to quantum groups, we find a one--parameter family of q-gaugetheories associated to the quantum group $ISO_q(3,1)$. Although the gaugefields, that is the spin--connection and the vierbeins are non--commutingobjects depending on a deformation parameter, $q$, it is possible to constructout of them a metric theory which is insensitive to the deformation. TheChristoffel symbols and the Riemann tensor are ordinary commuting objects.Hence it is argued that torsionless Einstein's General Relativity is the commoninvariant sector of a one--parameter family of deformed gauge theories.
