Backreaction of excitations on a planar domain wall in a real scalar fieldmodel is investigated in the cases of homogeneous, plane wave and wave packettype excitations. It is found that the excited domain wall radiates. The methodof calculating backreaction for the general forms of excitations is alsopresented.
