The experimental observation of intense light emission by acousticallydriven, periodically collapsing bubbles of air in water (sonoluminescence) hasyet to receive an adequate explanation. One of the most intriguing ideas isthat the conversion of acoustic energy into photons occurs quantummechanically, through a dynamical version of the Casimir effect. We have arguedelsewhere that in the adiabatic approximation, which should be reliable here,Casimir or zero-point energies cannot possibly be large enough to be relevant.(About 10 MeV of energy is released per collapse.) However, there aresufficient subtleties involved that others have come to opposite conclusions.In particular, it has been suggested that bulk energy, that is, simply thenaive sum of ${1\over2}\hbar\omega$, which is proportional to the volume, couldbe relevant. We show that this cannot be the case, based on general principlesas well as specific calculations. In the process we further illuminate some ofthe divergence difficulties that plague Casimir calculations, with an examplerelevant to the bag model of hadrons.
