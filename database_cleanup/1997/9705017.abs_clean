Decay of a near-extremal black hole down to the extremal state is studied inthe background field approximation to determine the fate of injected matter andHawking pairs. By examining the behavior of light rays and solutions to thewave equation it is concluded that the singularity at the origin is irrelevant.Furthermore, there is most likely an instability of the event horizon arisingfrom the accumulation of injected matter and Hawking partners there. Thepossible role of this instability in reconciling the D-brane and black holepictures of the decay process is discussed.
