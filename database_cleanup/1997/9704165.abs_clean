We consider open supermembranes in an eleven dimensional background. We showthat, in a flat space-time, the world-volume action is kappa-symmetric and hasglobal space-time supersymmetry if space-time has even dimensional topologicaldefects where the membrane can end. An example of such topological defects isprovided by the space-time with boundaries considered by Horava and Witten. Inthat case the world-volume action has reparametrisation anomalies whosecancellation requires the inclusion of a current algebra on the boundaries ofthe membrane. The role of kappa-anomalies in a general background is discussed.The tension of the membrane is related to the eleven dimensional gravitationalconstant with the aid of the Green-Schwarz mechanism allowing a consistencycheck of M-theory.
