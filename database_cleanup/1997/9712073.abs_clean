Kappa-symmetric worldvolume actions of the D3-, M5- and M2-branes can becoupled consistently to their near horizon bosonic geometry background. Westudy the gauge-fixed action in the approximation in which only the transverseradial direction of the brane is allowed to fluctuate. The generalized specialconformal symmetry of these self-interacting actions is established. This opensup a possibility to find out if the full superconformal symmetry of the freeactions of these branes survives in the presence of coupling defined by thesize of the anti-deSitter throat.
