Title: The Compatibility between the Higher Dimensions Self Duality and the

Yang-Mills Equation of MotionComments: LaTeX file

We study the compatiblity between the higher dimension dualities and theYang-Mills equation of motion. Taking a 't Hooft solution as a starting point,we come to the conclusion that for only 4 dimensions the self duality impliesthe equation of motion for generic instanton size. Whereas in higherdimensions, the self duality is compatable with the equation of motion,approximately, for small instanton size i.e. the zero curvature condition. Atthe mathematical level, the self duality is still useful since it transforms asecond order into a first order differential equation.
