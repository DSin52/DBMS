In a recent paper it was shown that the properties of Schwarzschild blackholes in 8 dimensions are correctly described up to factors of order unity byMatrix theory compactified on T^3. Here we consider compactifications on toriof general dimension d. Although in general little is known about the relevantd+1 dimensional theories on the dual tori, there are hints from theirapplication to near-extreme parallel Dirichlet d-branes. Using these hints weget the correct mass-entropy scaling for Schwarzschild black holes in (11-d)dimensions.
