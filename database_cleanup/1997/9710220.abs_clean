We propose a new, transport-theoretic (tt) class of relativistic extensionsof quantum field theories of fundamental interactions. Its concepts areinspired by Feynman's atomistic idea about the physical world and by theextension of fluid dynamics to shorter distances through the Boltzmanntransport equation. The extending tt Lagrangians imply the original Lagrangiansas path-integralwise approximations. By constructing a tt Lagrangian thatextends a general gauge-invariant Lagrangian, we show that a tt extension ofthe standard model is feasible. We define a tt Lagrangian in terms of tt fieldsof the spacetime variable and an additional, four-vector variable. We explainthe fields of quantum field theories as certain covariant, local averages of tt(i) a four-vector one unifying all fundamental forces, and (ii) atwo-component-spinor one unifying all fundamental matter particles. We commenton the new physics expected within the tt framework put forward, and point outsome open questions.
