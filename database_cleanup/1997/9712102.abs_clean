We classify and explicitly construct the embedding diagrams of Verma modulesover the N=2 supersymmetric extension of the Virasoro algebra. The essentialingredient of the solution consists in drawing the distinction between twodifferent types of submodules appearing in N=2 Verma modules. The problem issimplified by associating to every N=2 Verma module a relaxed Verma module overthe affine algebra ^sl(2) with an isomorphic embedding diagram. We then makeuse of the mechanism according to which the structure of the N=2/relaxed-sl(2)embedding diagrams can be found knowing the standard embedding diagrams of^sl(2) Verma modules. The resulting classification of the N=2/relaxed-^sl(2)embedding diagrams follows the I-II-III pattern extended by an additionalindication of the number (0, 1, or 2) and the twists of the standard ^sl(2)embedding diagrams contained in a given N=2/relaxed-^sl(2) embedding diagram.
