We show that the part of the tree-level open string effective action for thenon-abelian vector field which depends on the field strength but not on itscovariant derivatives, is given by the symmetrised trace of the directnon-abelian generalisation of the Born-Infeld invariant. We discussapplications to D-brane dynamics.
