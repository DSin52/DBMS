We present a systematic and unifying treatment of the problem of spontaneousnucleation of particle-antiparticle pairs in a (2+1)-dimensional system due toa static and uniform electromagnetic-like field, in the presence of quantumdissipation. We first describe a direct derivation of the Caldeira-Leggett typeof mechanism for quantum dissipation within the context of string theory and ofthe ensuing Born-Infeld action, pointing out the difference with the physicalcontext in which vacuum decay can occur. We then evaluate theparticle-antiparticle pair production rate, working out all the details of thecalculation and including also the effects of a possible periodic backgroundpotential and of the Coulomb-like particle-antiparticle attraction. The formerinduces a dissipation-driven localization which interferes with the effect ofthe driving electric-like field. We also hint at a possible application to theproblem of the decay of a supercurrent in a superconducting thin film due tovortex-antivortex nucleation in the presence of a pinning lattice.
