Kraemmer and Rebhan claimed the gauge independence of the conformal anomalyof bosonic string for various gauge fixings in the framework of theperturbation theory of two-dimensional quantum gravity. It is pointed out thattheir proof is wrong. The gauge independence is proved for the gauge-fixingswhich reduce to the linearized de Donder gauge in the flat limit of thebackground metric. Similar remarks are made also for the Rebhan-Kraemmercurrent anomaly.
