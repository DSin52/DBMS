We study the generating functional for the massless Schwinger model in thetorus, at nonzero chemical potential and temperature. The lack of hermiticityof the Dirac operator yields a non-trivial phase in the effective action, whichis a topological contribution induced by the chemical potential. In the sectorwith no zero modes, we evaluate exactly the generating functional, thepartition function, the boson propagator and the thermally averaged Polyakovloop. The system bosonizes at finite T and \mu, with the same mass as invacuum. From the solution obtained for the Schwinger model we derive alsoexactly the generating functional and the partition function for the masslessThirring model at nonzero T and \mu.
