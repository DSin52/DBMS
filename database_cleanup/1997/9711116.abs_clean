We consider the maximal central extension of the supertranslation algebra ind=4 and 3, which includes tensor central charges associated to topologicaldefects such as domain walls (membranes) and strings. We show that for allN-extended superalgebras these charges are related to nontrivial configurationson the scalar moduli space. For N=2 theories obtained from compactification onCalabi-Yau threefolds, we give an explicit realization of the moduli-dependentcharges in terms of wrapped branes.
