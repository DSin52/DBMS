Path-integral approach in imaginary and complex time has been provensuccessful in treating the tunneling phenomena in quantum mechanics and quantumfield theories. Latest developments in this field, the proper valley method inimaginary time, its application to various quantum systems, complex timeformalism, asympton theory for the large order analysis of the perturbationtheory, are reviewed in a self-contained manner.
