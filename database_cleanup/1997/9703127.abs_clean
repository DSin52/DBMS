We show that the field equations for the supercoordinates and the self--dualantisymmetric tensor field derived from the recently constructedkappa-invariant action for the M theory five-brane are equivalent to theequations of motion obtained in the doubly supersymmetric geometrical approachat the worldvolume component level.
