We present a crude Matrix Theory model for Schwarzchild black holes inuncompactified dimension greater than $5$. The model accounts for the size,entropy, and long range state interactions of black holes. The key feature ofthe model is a Boltzmann gas of D0 branes, a concept which depends on certainqualitative features of Matrix Theory which have not previously been utilizedin studies of black holes.
