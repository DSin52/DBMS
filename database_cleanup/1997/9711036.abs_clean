In this paper we give an inherently toric description of a special class ofsheaves (known as equivariant sheaves) over toric varieties, due in part to A.A. Klyachko. We apply this technology to heterotic compactifications, inparticular to the (0,2) models of Distler, Kachru, and also discuss howknowledge of equivariant sheaves can be used to reconstruct information aboutan entire moduli space of sheaves. Many results relevant to heteroticcompactifications previously known only to mathematicians are collected here --for example, results concerning whether the restriction of a stable sheaf to aCalabi-Yau hypersurface remains stable are stated. We also describesubstructure in the Kahler cone, in which moduli spaces of sheaves areindependent of Kahler class only within any one subcone. We study F theorycompactifications in light of this fact, and also discuss how it can be seen inthe context of equivariant sheaves on toric varieties. Finally we brieflyspeculate on the application of these results to (0,2) mirror symmetry.
