I give an introductory review of recent, fascinating developments insupersymmetric gauge theories. I explain pedagogically the miraculousproperties of supersymmetric gauge dynamics allowing one to obtain exactsolutions in many instances. Various dynamical regimes emerging insupersymmetric Quantum Chromodynamics and its generalizations are discussed. Iemphasize those features that have a chance of survival in QCD and those whichare drastically different in supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric gaugetheories.Unlike most of the recent reviews focusing almost entirely on the progress inextended supersymmetries (the Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 models), theselectures are mainly devoted to N=1 theories. The primary task is extractinglessons for non-supersymmetric theories.
