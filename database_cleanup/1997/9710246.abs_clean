Lepton-Photon 97. Continuous updates atAfter briefly reviewing basic concepts of perturbative string theory, weexplain in simple terms some of the new findings that created excitement amongthe string physicists. These developments include non-perturbative dualitiesand a unified picture that embraces the so-far known theories. (An overview fornon-experts)
