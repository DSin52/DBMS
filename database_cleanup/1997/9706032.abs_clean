We consider the low-energy effective field theory of heterotic string theorycompactified on a seven-torus, and we construct electrically charged as well asmore general solitonic solutions. These solutions preserve 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 ofN=8, D=3 supersymmetry and have Killing spinors which exist due to cancellationof holonomies. The associated space-time line elements do not exhibit theconical structure that often arises in 2+1 dimensional gravity theories.
