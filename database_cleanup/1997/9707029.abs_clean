We apply the principles discussed in earlier papers to the construction ofdiscrete time quantum field theories. We use the Schwinger action principle tofind the discrete time free field commutators for scalar fields, which allowsus to set up the reduction formalism for discrete time scattering processes.Then we derive the discrete time analogue of the Feynman rules for a scalarfield with a cubic self interaction and give examples of discrete timescattering amplitude calculations. We find overall conservation of total linearmomentum and overall conservation of total theta parameters, which is thediscrete time analogue of energy conservation and corresponds to the existenceof a Logan invariant for the system. We find that temporal discretisation leadsto softened vertex factors, modifies propagators and gives a natural cutoff forphysical particle momenta.
