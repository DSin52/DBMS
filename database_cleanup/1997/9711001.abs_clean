We compare the $(0,2)$ theory of the single M5 brane decoupled from gravityin the lightcone with transverse $R^4$, and a matrix model description in termsof quantum mechanics on instanton moduli space. We give some tests of theMatrix model in the case of multi fivebranes on $R^4$. We extract constraintson the operator content of the field theory of the multi-fivebrane system byanalyzing the Matrix model. We also begin a study of compactifications of the$(0,2)$ theory in this framework, arguing that for large compactification scalethe $(0,2)$ theory is described by super-quantum mechanics on appropriateinstanton moduli spaces.
