textThe quantum mechanics of an N=1 supersymmetric dynamical system constrainedto a hypersurface embedded in the higher dimensional Euclidean space isinvestigated by using the projection-operator method (POM) of constrainedsystems. It is shown that the Hamiltonian obtained by the successive operationsof projection operators contains the additional terms, which are completelymissed when imposing constraints before the quantization. We derive theconditions the additional terms should satisfy when the N=1 supersymmetry holdsin the resulting system, and present the geometrical interpretations of theseadditional terms.
