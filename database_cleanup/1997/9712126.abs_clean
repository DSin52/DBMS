We show that parity symmetry is not spontaneously broken in the CP^N sigmamodel for any value of N when the coefficient of the $\theta$--term becomes$\theta=\pi$ (mod $2\pi$). The result follows from a non-perturbative analysisof the nodal structure of the vacuum functional $\psi_0(z)$. The dynamical roleof sphalerons turns out to be very important for the argument. The resultintroduces severe constraints on the possible critical behavior of the modelsat $\theta=\pi$ (mod $2\pi$).
