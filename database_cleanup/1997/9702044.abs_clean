Title: On the Stability of the GPS Magnetic Monopole Solution

Authors: Bj{\o}rn Jensen and Parviz H. Mani

Comments: 9 Pages, RevTex

The question of the stability of the four dimensional Gross-Perry-SorkinKaluza-Klein magnetic monopole solution is investigated within the framework ofa N=2, D=5 supergravity theory. We show that this solution does not support aspin structure of the Killing type and is therefore, contrary to previousexpectations, not necessarily stable.
