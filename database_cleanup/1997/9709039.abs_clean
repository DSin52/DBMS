Using the path-integral approach, the quantum massive Thirring andsine-Gordon models are proven to be equivalent at finite temperature. Thisresult is an extension of Coleman's proof of the equivalence between boththeories at zero temperature. The usual identifications among the parameters ofthese models also remain valid at $T \neq 0$.
