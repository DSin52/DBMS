The Dualized Standard Model which has a number of very interesting physicalconsequences is itself based on the concept of a nonabelian generalization toelectric-magnetic duality. This paper explains first the reasons why theordinary (Hodge) * does not give duality for the nonabelian theory and thenreviews the steps by which these difficulties are surmounted, leading to ageneralized duality transform formulated in loop space. The significance ofthis in relation to the Dualized Standard Model is explained, and possibly alsoto some other areas.
