A new method to obtain the Picard-Fuchs equations of effective, N=2supersymmetric gauge theories with massive matter hypermultiplets in thefundamental representation is presented. It generalises a previously describedmethod to derive the Picard-Fuchs equations of both pure super Yang-Mills andsupersymmetric gauge theories with massless matter hypermultiplets. Thetechniques developed are well suited to symbolic computer calculations.
