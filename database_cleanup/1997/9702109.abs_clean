An expression for the spacetime absorption coefficient of a scalar field in afive dimensional, near extremal black hole background is derived, which has thesame form as that presented by Maldacena and Strominger, but is valid over alarger, U-duality invariant region of parameter space and in general disagreeswith the corresponding D-brane result. We develop an argument, based on D-branethermodynamics, which specifies the range of parameters over which agreementshould be expected. For neutral emission, the spacetime and D-brane resultsagree over this range. However, for charged emission, we find disagreement inthe `Fat Black Hole' regime, in which charge is quantized in smaller units onthe brane, than in the bulk of spacetime. We indicate a possible problem withthe D-brane model in this regime. We also use the Born approximation to studythe high frequency limit of the absorption coefficient and find that itapproaches unity, for large black hole backgrounds, at frequencies still belowthe string scale, again in disagreement with D-brane results.
