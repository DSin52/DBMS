The standard eleven-dimensional supergravity action depends on a three-formgauge field and does not allow direct coupling to five-branes. Using previouslydeveloped methods, we construct a covariant eleven-dimensional supergravityaction depending on a three-form and six-form gauge field in aduality-symmetric manner. This action is coupled to both the M-theory two-braneand five-brane, and corresponding equations of motion are obtained. Consistentcoupling relates D=11 duality properties with self-duality properties of theM-5-brane. From this duality-symmetric formulation, one can derive an actiondescribing coupling of the M-branes to standard D=11 supergravity.
