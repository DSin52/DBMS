The relation between the trace and R-current anomalies in supersymmetrictheories implies that the U$(1)_RF^2$, U$(1)_R$ and U$(1)_R^3$ anomalies whichare matched in studies of N=1 Seiberg duality satisfy positivity constraints.Some constraints are rigorous and others conjectured as four-dimensionalgeneralizations of the Zamolodchikov $c$-theorem. These constraints are testedin a large number of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in the non-AbelianCoulomb phase, and they are satisfied in all renormalizable models with uniqueanomaly-free R-current, including those with accidental symmetry. Most strikingis the fact that the flow of the Euler anomaly coefficient, $a_{UV}-a_{IR}$, isalways positive, as conjectured by Cardy.
