We present analytic cosmological solutions in a model of two-dimensionaldilaton gravity with back reaction. One of these solutions exhibits a gracefulexit from the inflationary to the FRW phase and is nonsingular everywhere. Aduality related second solution is found to exist only in the ``pre-big-bang''epoch and is singular at $\tau = 0$. In either case back reaction is shown toplay a crucial role in determining the specific nature of these geometries.
