We discuss the physics of topological vortices moving on an arbitrary surfaceM in a Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in which the gauge group G breaks to a finitesubgroup H. We concentrate on the case where M is compact and/or nonorientable.Interesting new features arise which have no analog on the plane. Theconsequences for the quantum statistics of vortices are discussed, particularlywhen H is nonabelian.
