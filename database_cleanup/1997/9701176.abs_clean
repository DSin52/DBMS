A gauge-averaging functional of the axial type is studied for simplesupergravity at one loop about flat Euclidean four-space bounded by athree-sphere, or two concentric three-spheres. This is a generalization ofrecent work on the axial gauge in quantum supergravity on manifolds withboundary. Ghost modes obey nonlocal boundary conditions of the spectral type,in that half of them obey Dirichlet or Neumann conditions at the boundary. Inboth cases, they give a vanishing contribution to the one-loop divergence. Theadmissibility of noncovariant gauges at the classical level is also proved.
