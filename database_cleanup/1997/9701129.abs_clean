Generalizing the work of Sen, we analyze special points in the moduli spaceof the compactification of the F-theory on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yauthreefolds where the coupling remains constant. These contain points wherethey can be realized as orbifolds of six torus $T^6$ by $Z_m \times Z_n (m,n=2, 3, 4, 6)$. At various types of intersection points of singularities, wefind that the enhancement of gauge symmetries arises from the intersection oftwo kinds of singularities. We also argue that when we take the Hirzebruchsurface as a base for the Calabi- Yau threefold, the condition for constantcoupling corresponds to the case where the point like instantons coalesce,giving rise to enhanced gauge group of $Sp(k)$.
