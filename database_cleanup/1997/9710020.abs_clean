We construct type II A brane configuration of N=(4,4) supersymmetric twodimensional gauge theory with gauge group U(1) and N_f hypermultiplets in thefundamental representation. By lifting to M-theory (strong coupling), we cansee the origin of the R-symmetry enhancement of the Coulomb branch. One canalso find two theories which become equivalent at strong coupling.
