We study orbifolds of (0,2) models and their relation to (0,2) mirrorsymmetry. In the Landau-Ginzburg phase of a (0,2) model the superpotentialfeatures a whole bunch of discrete symmetries, which by quotient action lead toa variety of consistent (0,2) vacua. We study a few examples in very muchdetail. Furthermore, we comment on the application of (0,2) mirror symmetry tothe calculation of Yukawa couplings in the space-time superpotential.
