Title: Renormalization of Hamiltonians in the Light-Front Fock Space

University)Comments: plain LaTeX file, 81 pages

We outline an ultraviolet renormalization procedure for hamiltonians actingin the light-front Fock space. The hamiltonians are defined and calculatedusing creation and annihilation operators with no limitation of the space ofstates. Both, the regularization of the initial hamiltonian and the definitionof the renormalized effective hamiltonians, preserve the light-front framekinematical symmetries. The general equations for the effective hamiltoniansare illustrated by second order calculations of the self-energy andtwo-particle interaction terms in Yukawa theory, QED and QCD. Infraredsingularities are regulated but not renormalized.
