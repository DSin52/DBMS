The 2-dimensional version of the Schwarz and Sen duality model (Tseytlinmodel) is analyzed at the classical and quantum levels. The solutions areobtained after removing the gauge dependent sector using the Dirac method. ThePoincar\`e invariance is verified at both levels. An extension with globalsupersymmetry is also proposed.
