We study the domain walls connecting different chirally asymmetric vacua insupersymmetric QCD. We show that BPS - saturated solutions exist only in thelimited range of mass. When m exceeds some critical value, the domain walleither ceases to be BPS - saturated or disappears altogether. In any case, theproperties of the system are qualitatively changed.
