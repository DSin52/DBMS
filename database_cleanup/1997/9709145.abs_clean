The link between chirality in the fermion sector and (anti-)self-duality inthe boson sector is reexamined in the light of Connes' noncommutative geometryapproach to the Standard Model. We find it to impose that the noncommutativeYang-Mills action be symmetrized in an analogous way to the Dirac-Yukawaoperator itself.
