Using numerical simulations, the stability and scattering properties of theO(3) model on a two-dimensional torus are studied. Its solitons are found to beunstable but can be stabilized by the addition of a Skyrme term to theLagrangian. Scattering at right angles with respect to the initial direction ofmotion is observed in all cases considered. The model has no solutions ofdegree one, so when a field configuration that resembles a soliton isconsidered, it shrinks to become infinitely thin. A comparison of these resultswith those of the model defined on the sphere is made.
