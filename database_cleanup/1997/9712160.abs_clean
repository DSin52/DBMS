We consider a supersymmetric system of D-5-branes compactified on a 5-toruswith a self-dual background field strength on a 4-torus and carryingleft-moving momentum along a circle. The corresponding supergravity solutiondescribes a 5-dimensional black hole with a regular horizon. The entropy ofthis black hole may be explained in terms of the Landau degeneracy for openstrings stretching between different branes. In the gauge theory approximationthis D-5-brane system is described by a super Yang-Mills theory with a t'Hoofttwist. By choosing a supersymmetric branch of the theory we obtain perfectagreement with the entropy formula. The result relies on the number of masslesstorons associated with the gauge field components that obey twisted boundaryconditions.
