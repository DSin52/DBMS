We extend ideas developed for the loop representation of quantum gravity todiffeomorphism-invariant gauge theories coupled to fermions. Let P -> Sigma bea principal G-bundle over space and let F be a vector bundle associated to Pwhose fiber is a sum of continuous unitary irreducible representations of thecompact connected gauge group G, each representation appearing together withits dual. We consider theories whose classical configuration space is A x F,where A is the space of connections on P and F is the space of sections of F,regarded as a collection of Grassmann-valued fermionic fields. We construct the`quantum configuration space a x f as a completion of A x F. Using this weconstruct a Hilbert space L^2(a x f) for the quantum theory on which allautomorphisms of P act as unitary operators, and determine an explicit `spinnetwork basis' of the subspace L^2((a x f)/G) consisting of gauge-invariantstates. We represent observables constructed from holonomies of the connectionalong paths together with fermionic fields and their conjugate momenta asoperators on L^2((a x f)/G). We also construct a Hilbert space H_diff ofdiffeomorphism-invariant states using the group averaging procedure ofAshtekar, Lewandowski, Marolf, Mourao and Thiemann.
