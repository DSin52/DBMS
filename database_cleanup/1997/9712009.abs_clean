Title: High-speed Contraction of Transverse Rotations to Gauge Transformations

Comments: RevTex 15 pages, no figures; presented at the International Workshop

on Quantum Groups, Deformations, and Contractions, Istanbul, Turkey(September 1997); to be published in the ProceedingsThe Inonu-Wigner contraction is applied to special relativity and the littlegroups of the Lorentz group. If the O(3) symmetry group for massive particle isboosted to an infinite-momentum frame, it becomes contracted to a combinationof the cylindrical group and the two-dimensional Euclidean group. The Euclideancomponent becomes the Lorentz condition applicable to the electromagneticfour-potential, and the cylindrical component leads to the helicity and gaugedegrees of freedom. The rotation around the cylindrical axis corresponds to thehelicity, while the translation parallel to the axis on the cylindrical surfaceleads to a gauge transformation.
