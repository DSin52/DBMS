We analyse the world-volume theory of multiple Kaluza-Klein monopoles instring and M-theory by identifying the appropriate zero modes of variousfields. The results are consistent with supersymmetry, and all conjecturedduality symmetries. In particular for M-theory and type IIA string theory, thelow energy dynamics of N Kaluza-Klein monopoles is described by supersymmetricU(N) gauge theory, and for type IIB string theory, the low energy dynamics isdescribed by a (2,0) supersymmetric field theory in (5+1) dimensions with Ntensor multiplets and tensionless self-dual strings. It is also argued that forthe Kaluza-Klein monopoles in heterotic string theory, the apparently flatmoduli space gets converted to the moduli space of BPS monopoles in SU(2) gaugetheory when higher derivative corrections to the supergravity equations ofmotion are taken into account.
