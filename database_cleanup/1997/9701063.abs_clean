Title: SUSY and Flat Direction in de Sitter Space

Comments: 32 pages, Latex, 14 figures. Reference added, minor changes in

Discussion are madeWe have found that supersymmetry (SUSY) in curved space is broken softly. Itis also found that Pauli-Villars regularization preserves the remainingsymmetry, softly broken SUSY. Using it we computed the one-loop effectivepotential along a (classical) flat direction in a Wess-Zumino model in deSitter space. The analysis is relevant to the Affleck-Dine mechanism for$V_{eff}(\phi)\to -3g^2H^2\phi ^2 ln \phi ^2 /16\pi ^2$, where $\phi$ is thescalar field along the flat direction, g is a typical coupling constant, and His the Hubble parameter. This is identical with the effective potential whichis obtained by using proper-time cutoff regularization. Since proper-timecutoff regularization is exact even at the large curvature region, theeffective potential possesses softly broken SUSY and reliability in the largecurvature region.
