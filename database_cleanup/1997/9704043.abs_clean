We study N=1 four dimensional gauge theories as the world volume theory ofD4-branes between NS 5-branes. We find constructions for a number of knownfield theory dualities involving $SU(N_c)\times SU(N_c')$ groups, coupled bymatter fields F in the $(N_c, \bar N_c)$ representation, in terms of branes oftype IIA string theory. The dual gauge group follows from simply reversing theordering of the NS 5-branes and the D6-branes while conserving magnetic chargeon the world volume of the branes. We interpret many field theory phenomenasuch as deformation of the superpotential $W = \Tr (F\tilde F)^{k+1}$ in termsof the position of branes. By looking to D-branes for guidance, we find new N=1dualities involving arbitrary numbers of gauge groups. We propose a mechanismfor enhanced chiral symmetry in the brane construction which, we conjecture, isassociated with tensionless threebranes in six dimensions.
