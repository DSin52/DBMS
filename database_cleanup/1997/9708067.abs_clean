A supersymmetric theory with several scalar superfields generically hasseveral domain wall type classical configurations which interpolate betweenvarious supersymmetric vacua of the scalar fields. Depending on the couplings,some of these configurations develop instability and decay into multiple domainwalls, others can form intersections in space. These phenomena are consideredhere in a simplest, yet non-trivial, model with two scalar superfields.
