We provide evidence that some four-dimensional N=1 string vacua withdifferent numbers of generations are connected through phase transitions. Thetransitions involve going through a point in moduli space where there is anontrivial fixed point governing the low energy field theory. In an M-theorydescription, the examples involve wrapped 5-branes leaving one of the ends ofthe world.
