Mass perturbations of the twisted N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory consideredby Vafa and Witten to test S-duality are studied for the case of Kahlerfour-manifolds. It is shown that the resulting mass-perturbed theory can beregarded as an equivariant extension associated to a U(1) symmetry of thetwisted theory, which is only present for Kahler manifolds. In addition, it isshown that the partition function, the only topological invariant of thetheory, remains invariant under the perturbation.
