A Lorentz covariant matrix regularization of membrane thories is studied.Itis shown that the action for a bosonic membrane can be defined by matrixregularization in a Lorentz covariant manner. The generator of area preservingdiffeomorphism can also be consistently defined by matrix regularization, andwe can make the area preserving gauge symmetry manifest. However, thereparametrization BRST charge explicitly depends on a specific basis setintroduced to define the matrix regularization. We also briefly comment on anextension of the present formulation to a supermembrane.
