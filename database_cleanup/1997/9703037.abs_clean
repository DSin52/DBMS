Title: Duality of the 2D Nonhomogeneous Ising Model on the Torus

Theoretical Physics, Kiev)Comments: 7 pages, LATEX

Duality relations for the 2D nonhomogeneous Ising model on the finite squarelattice wrapped on the torus are obtained. The partition function of the modelon the dual lattice with arbitrary combinations of the periodical andantiperiodical boundary conditions along the cycles of the torus is expressedthrough some specific combination of the partition functions of the model onthe original lattice with corresponding boundary conditions. It is shown thatthe structure of the duality relations is connected with the topologicalpeculiarities of the dual transformation of the model on the torus.
