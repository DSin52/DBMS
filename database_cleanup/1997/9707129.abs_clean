We prove that there is no power-counting renormalizable nonabeliangeneralization of the abelian topological mass mechanism in four dimensions.The argument is based on the technique of consistent deformations of the masterequation developed by G. Barnich and one of the authors. Recent attemptsinvolving extra fields are also commented upon.
