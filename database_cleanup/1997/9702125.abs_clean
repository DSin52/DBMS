The time-dependence of correlation functions under the influence of classicalequations of motion is described by an exact evolution equation. Forconservative systems thermodynamic equilibrium is a fixed point of theseequations. We show that this fixed point is not universally stable, sinceinfinitely many conserved correlation functions obstruct the approach toequilibrium. Equilibrium can therefore be reached at most for suitably averagedquantities or for subsystems, similar to quantum statistics. The classical timeevolution of correlation functions shows many dynamical features of quantummechanics.
