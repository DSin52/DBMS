We propose a method for constructing super-brane actions where everybackground tensor potential corresponds to a world-volume field strength. Theprocedure provides a natural coupling to the background and automaticallydisplays the SL(2;Z) symmetry of the IIB string theory. The Dirichlet 3-braneis used as a test ground for these ideas. A polynomial action consistent withnon-linear self-duality is presented. Invariance of the action underkappa-symmetry is demonstrated for arbitrary on-shell type IIB supergravitybackgrounds and is shown to require self-duality.
