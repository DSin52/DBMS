We consider subleading terms in the one-loop Matrix theory potential betweena classical membrane state and a supergraviton. Nontrivial terms arise at orderv/r^8 and v^3/r^8 which are proportional to the angular momentum of themembrane state. The effective potential for a graviton moving in a boostedKerr-type metric is computed and shown to agree precisely with the Matrixtheory calculation at leading order in the long-distance expansion for eachpower of the graviton velocity. This result generalizes to arbitrary order; weshow that terms in the membrane-graviton potential corresponding to nth momentsof the membrane stress-energy tensor are reproduced correctly to all orders inthe long-distance expansion by terms of the form F^4 X^n in the one-loop Matrixtheory calculation.
