Title: Domain Wall in MQCD and Supersymmetric Cycles in Exceptional Holonomy

ManifoldsComments: Latex, 15 pages, improved version

It was conjectured by Witten that a BPS-saturated domain wall exists in theM-theory fivebrane version of QCD (MQCD) and can be represented as asupersymmetric three-cycle in the sense of Becker et al with an appropriateasymptotic behavior. We derive the differential equation which defines anassociative cycle in $G_2$ holonomy seven-manifold corresponding to thesupersymmetric three-cycle and show that it contains a sum of the Poissonbrackets. We study solutions of the differential equation with prescribedasymptotic behavior.
