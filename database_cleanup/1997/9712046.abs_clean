Various features of domain walls in supersymmetric gluodynamics arediscussed. We give a simple field-theoretic interpretation of the phenomenon ofstrings ending on the walls recently conjectured by Witten. An explanation ofthis phenomenon in the framework of gauge field theory is outlined. Thephenomenon is argued to be particularly natural in supersymmetric theorieswhich support degenerate vacuum states with distinct physical properties. Theissue of existence (or non-existence) of the BPS saturated walls in thetheories with glued (super)potentials is addressed. The amendedVeneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian belongs to this class. The physicalorigin of the cusp structure of the effective Lagrangian is revealed, and thelimitation it imposes on the calculability of the wall tension is explained.Related problems are considered. In particular, it is shown that the so calleddiscrete anomaly matching, when properly implemented, does not rule out thechirally symmetric phase of supersymmetric gluodynamics, contrary to recentclaims.
