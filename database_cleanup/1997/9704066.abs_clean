Title: Nonelectromagnetic duality in twisted N=4 model

Comments: LaTeX, 14 pages

In this paper we discuss the possible existing correlation functions in theN=4 topological model. Due to the distinguished feature that no anomaly existsin N=4 supersymmetric theories, the positive-negative ghost number balance hasto be taken into account while considering the correlation functions. Onrestriction to Kahler manifolds we may find a perturbative mass term whichbreaks the N=4 supersymmetry down to N=1. In all of these, a nonelectromagneticduality plays an important role. Moreover, to get a computable generatingfunctional the existence of a proper vanishing theorem is required.
