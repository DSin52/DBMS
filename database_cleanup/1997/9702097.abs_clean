We investigate the effect of an external gravitational fields to the chiralsymmetry breaking in the SUSY (supersymmetric) NJL (Nambu-Jona-Lasinio) modelnon-minimally interacting with external supergravity. Evaluating the effectivepotential in the leading order of the $1/N_{c}$-expansion and in the linearcurvature approximation it is found the possibility of the chiral symmetrybreaking in the SUSY NJL model in an external gravitational fields. In thebroken phase the dynamically generated mass is analytically and numericallycalculated.
