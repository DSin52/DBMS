We examine the claim that the effective action of four-dimensional SU(2)_Lgauge theory at high and low temperature contains a three-dimensionalChern-Simons term with coefficient being the chemical potential for baryonnumber. We perform calculations in a two-dimensional toy model and find thatthe existence of the term is rather subtle.
