We argue that supersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation in the stronglycoupled heterotic string can be described by an analogue of Scherk-Schwarzcompactification on the eleventh dimension in M-theory. The M-theory scale isidentified with the gauge coupling unification mass, whereas the radius of theeleventh dimension $\rho$ is at an intermediate scale $\rho^{-1}\sim 10^{12}$GeV. At the lowest order, supersymmetry is broken only in the gravitational andmoduli sector at a scale $m_{3/2}\sim\rho^{-1}$, while it is mediated bygravitational interactions to the observable world. Computation of the masssplittings yields in general a hierarchy of soft masses at the TeV scale$(\sim\rho^{-2}/M_p)$ with matter scalars much heavier than gauginos.
