In this paper we consider Type I string theory compactified on a Z_7orbifold. The model has N=1 supersymmetry, a U(4) \otimes U(4) \otimes U(4)\otimes SO(8) gauge group, and chiral matter. There are only D9-branes (forwhich we discuss tadpole cancellation conditions) in this model correspondingto a perturbative heterotic description in a certain region of the modulispace. We construct the heterotic dual, match the perturbative type I andheterotic tree-level massless spectra via giving certain scalars appropriatevevs, and point out the crucial role of the perturbative superpotential (on theheterotic side) for this matching. The relevant couplings in thissuperpotential turn out to be non-renormalizable (unlike the Z-orbifold casediscussed in Ref [1], where Yukawa couplings sufficed for duality matching). Wealso discuss the role of the anomalous U(1) gauge symmetry present in both typeI and heterotic models. In the perturbative regime we match the (tree-level)moduli spaces of these models. We point out possible generalizations of the Z_3and Z_7 cases to include D5-branes which would help in understandingnon-perturbative five-brane dynamics on the heterotic side.
