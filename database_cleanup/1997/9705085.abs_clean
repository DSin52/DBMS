We subject the methodology used to derive the effective dynamics oftopological defects to a critical reappraisal, using the two-dimensional kinkas an illustrative example. Special care is taken on how the zero modes shouldbe handled in order to avoid overcounting of degrees of freedom. This is anissue that has been overlooked in many recent contributions on the derivationof domain wall effective actions. We show that, unless such redundancy iscompletely removed by means of a sort of gauge-fixing, the expression obtainedfor the effective action will not be consistent. We readdress some earliercalculations over the existence of curvature corrections in the light of theprevious discussion and briefly comment on the application of this method tohigher dimensional topological defects.
