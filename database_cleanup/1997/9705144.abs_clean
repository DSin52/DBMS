In a recent paper (hep-th/9703084) it was conjectured that the imaginarysimple roots of the Borcherds algebra $g_{II_{9,1}}$ at level 1 are its onlyones. We here propose an independent test of this conjecture, establishing itsvalidity for all roots of norm $\geq -8$. However, the conjecture fails forroots of norm -10 and beyond, as we show by computing the simple multiplicitiesdown to norm -24, which turn out to be remakably small in comparison with thecorresponding $E_{10}$ multiplicities. Our derivation is based on a modifieddenominator formula combining the denominator formulas for $E_{10}$ and$g_{II_{9,1}}$, and provides an efficient method for determining the imaginarysimple roots. In addition, we compute the $E_{10}$ multiplicities of all rootsup to height 231, including levels up to $\ell =6$ and norms -42.
