In this work we construct a gauge invariant description of free massiveparticle with an arbitrary integer spin. Such description allows one toinvestigate the problem of consistent interactions for massive high spinparticles using the requirement that the whole interaction Lagrangian must begauge invariant. As a first example of such approach, we consider the case ofin a case of the arbitrary field and a full theory for the homogeneouselectromagnetic field in the space-time of any dimensionality.
