Configurations of two or more branes wrapping different homology cycles ofspace-time are considered and the amount of supersymmetry preserved isanalysed, generalising the analysis of multiple branes in flat space. For K3compactifications, these give the Type II or M theory origin of certainsupersymmetric four-dimensional heterotic string solutions that fit intospin-3/2 multiplets and which become massless at certain points in modulispace. The interpretation of these BPS states and the possibility ofsupersymmetry enhancement are discussed.
