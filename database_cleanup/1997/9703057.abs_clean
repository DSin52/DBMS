The twice-dimensionally reduced Seiberg-Witten monopole equations admitsolutions depending on two real parameters (b,c) and an arbitrary analyticfunction f(z) determining a solution of Liouville's equation. The U(1) andmanifold curvature 2-forms F and R^1_2 are invariant under fractional SL(2,R)transformations of f(z). When b=1/2 and c=0 and f(z) is the Fuchsian functionuniformizing an algebraic function whose Riemann surface has genus p \geq 2 ,the solutions, now SL(2,R) invariant, are the same surfaces accompanied by aU(1) bundle of c_1=\pm (p-1) and a 1-component constant spinor.
