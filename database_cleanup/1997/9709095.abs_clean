We consider QED - processes in the presence of an infinitely thin andinfinitely long straight string with a magnetic flux inside it. Thebremsstrahlung from an electron passing by the magnetic string and theelectron-positron pair production by a single photon are reviewed. Based on theexact electron and positron solutions of the Dirac equation in the externalAharonov-Bohm potential we present matrix elements for these processes. Thedependence of the resulting cross sections on energies, directions andpolarizations of the involved particles is discussed for low energies.
