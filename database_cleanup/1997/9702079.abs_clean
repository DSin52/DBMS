Non-extremal intersecting p-brane solutions of gravity coupled with severalantisymmetric fields and dilatons in various space-time dimensions areconstructed. The construction uses the same algebraic method of findingsolutions as in the extremal case and a modified "no-force" conditions. Wejustify the "deformation" prescription. It is shown that the non-extremalintersecting p-brane solutions satisfy harmonic superposition rule and theintersections of non-extremal p-branes are specified by the same characteristicequations for the incidence matrices as for the extremal p-branes. We show thatS-duality holds for non-extremal p-brane solutions. Generalized T-duality takesplace under additional restrictions to the parameters of the theory which arethe same as in the extremal case.
