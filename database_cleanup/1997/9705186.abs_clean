Title: Bosonization in d > 2 dimensions

Comments: Talk given at "Trends in Theoretical Physics, CERN - Santiago de

Compostela - La Plata Meeting", La Plata, April 1997, 34 pages, latexI discuss in this talk a bosonization approach recently developed. It leadsto the (exact) bosonization rule for fermion currents in d > 2 dimensions andalso provides a systematic way of constructing the bosonic action in differentregimes.
