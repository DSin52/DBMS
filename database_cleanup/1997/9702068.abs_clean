In string-bit models, string is described as a polymer of point-likeconstituents. We attempt to use string-bit ideas to investigate how the size ofstring is affected by string interactions in a non-perturbative context.Lacking adequate methods to deal with the full complications of bitrearrangement interactions, we study instead a simplified analog model withonly ``direct'' potential interactions among the bits. We use the variationalprinciple in an approximate calculation of the mean-square size of a polymer asa function of the number of constituents/bits for various interaction strengthsg in three specific models.
