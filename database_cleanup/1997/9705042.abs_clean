The neutral Kaon system is used to test the quantum theory of resonancescattering and decay phenomena. The two dimensional Lee-Oehme-Yang theory withcomplex Hamiltonian is obtained by truncating the complex basis vectorexpansion of the exact theory in Rigged Hilbert space. This can be done for K_1and K_2 as well as for K_S and K_L, depending upon whether one chooses the(self-adjoint, semi-bounded) Hamiltonian as commuting or non-commuting with CP.As an unexpected curiosity one can show that the exact theory (withouttruncation) predicts long-time 2 pion decays of the neutral Kaon system even ifthe Hamiltonian conserves CP.
