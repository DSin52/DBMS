Title: Proposals on nonperturbative superstring interactions

Comments: plain LaTeX, 22 pages, 1st revision

level-matching conditions explainedWe show a possibility that the matrix models recently proposed to explain(almost) all the physics of M-theory may include the superstring theories thatwe know perturbatively. The ``1st quantized'' physical system of one IIA stringseems to be an exact consequence of M(atrix) theory with a proper mechanism tomod out a symmetry. The central point of the paper is the representation ofstrings with P^+/epsilon greater than one. I call the mechanism ``screwingstrings to matrices''. I also give the first versions of the proof of 2/3 powerlaw between the compactification radius and the coupling constant in thisformulation. Multistring states are involved in a M(atrix) theory fashion,replacing the 2nd quantization that I briefly review. We shortly discuss theT-dualities, type I string theory and involving of FP ghosts to all the systemsincluding the original one of Banks et al.
