fixedThe BRST structure of a current satisfying a non abelian affine algebra intwo dimensions was studied by Isidro and Ramallo and an N=2 SuperconformalAlgebra was obtained. In this paper, we study the total BRST and anti BRSTstructure of the topological algebra. We end up with an N=4 Superconformalalgebra in which the central charge drops out of most of the OPE's. The priceone has to pay is that the no. of operators proliferates tremendously and thealgebra becomes infinite dimensional.
