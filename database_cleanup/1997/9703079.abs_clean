We discuss the principles to be used in the construction of discrete timeclassical and quantum mechanics as applied to point particle systems. In theclassical theory this includes the concept of virtual path and the constructionof system functions from classical Lagrangians, Cadzow's variational principleapplied to the action sum, Maeda-Noether and Logan invariants of the motion,elliptic and hyperbolic harmonic oscillator behaviour, gauge invariantelectrodynamics and charge conservation, and the Grassmannian oscillator. Firstquantised discrete time mechanics is discussed via the concept of systemamplitude, which permits the construction of all quantities of interest such ascommutators and scattering amplitudes. We discuss stroboscopic quantummechanics, or the construction of discrete time quantum theory from continuoustime quantum theory and show how this works in detail for the free Newtonianparticle. We conclude with an application of the Schwinger action principle tothe important case of the quantised discrete time inhomogeneous oscillator.
