Ontario, July 1997The dyonic quantum states of magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theorywith a non-abelian unbroken gauge group display a subtle interplay betweenmagnetic and electric properties. This is described in detail in the theorywith the gauge group SU(3) broken to U(2), and shown to be captured by therepresentation theory of the semi-direct product of U(2) with R^4. Theimplications of this observation for the fusion rules and electric-magneticduality properties of dyonic states are pointed out.
