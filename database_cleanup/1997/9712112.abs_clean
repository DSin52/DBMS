In this paper we perform a detailed investigation of the Dirichleteight-brane of the Type IIA string theory, when the effects of gravity areincluded. In particular, consider what happens when one allows the ten-formfield strength $F_{10}$ to vary discontinuously across the worldvolume of thebrane. Since the ten-form is constant on each side of the brane ($d*F_{10} =0$), a variation in the bulk term $\int F_{10}*F_{10}$ gives rise to a netpressure acting on the surface of the brane. This means that the infinite`planar' eight-brane is no longer a static configuration with these boundaryconditions. Instead, a static configuration is found only when the brane`compactifies' to the topology of an eight-sphere, $S^8$. These sphericaleight-branes are thus bubbles which form boundaries between different phases ofthe massive Type IIA supergravity theory. While these bubbles are genericallyunstable and will want to expand (or contract), we show that in certain casesthere is a critical radius, $r_c$, at which the (inward) tension of the braneis exactly counterbalanced by the (outward) force exerted by the pressureterms. Intuitively, these `compactified' branes are just spherical bubbleswhere the effective cosmological constant jumps by a discrete amount as youcross a brane worldsheet. We argue that these branes will be unstable tovarious semi-classical decay processes. We discuss the implications of suchprocesses for the open strings which have endpoints on the eight-brane.
