We study the microcanonical density of states and the thermal properties of abosonic string gas starting from a calculation of the Helmholtz free energy inthe S-representation. By adding more and more strings to the single stringsystem, we induce that, for infinite volume, there is no negative specific heatregion but a transition at a finite value of the energy per string from the lowenergy regime to a region of infinite specific heat at the Hagedorntemperature. Forcing the description of this phase in terms of strings gives apicture in which there is a very fat string in a sea of low energetic ones. Weargue that the necessary changing of this description should not change thefact that perturbatively $T_H$ is a maximum temperature of the system.
