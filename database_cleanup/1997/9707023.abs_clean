Title: The Spinning Membrane and Skyrmions Revisited

Authors: Carlos Castro

Comments: 18 pages, revised Tex file. It is further discussed how the Skyrmion

action contains the action of the large N limit of N coincident D0-branesA local world volume Q-supersymmetric Weyl invariant Lagrangian for themembrane is presented. An analysis is provided which solves the problems raisedby some authors in the past concerning the algebraic elimination of theauxiliary fields belonging to the coupling function supermultiplet. Thestarting bosonic action is the one given by Dolan and Tchrakian with vanishingcosmological constant and with quadratic, quartic derivative terms. OurLagrangian differs from the one of Lindstrom and Rocek in the fact that ispolynomial in the fields facilitating the quantization process. It is argued,rigorously, that if one wishes to construct polynomial actions withoutcurvature terms and where supersymmetry is linearly realized, after theelimination of auxiliary fields, one must relinquish S supersymmetry andconcentrate solely on the Q-supersymmetry associated with the superconformalalgebra in three dimensions. The role that this spinning membrane action mayhave in the theory of D-branes, Skyrmions and BPS monopoles is also pointedout.
