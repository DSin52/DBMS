It is shown that the beta functions for four dimensional N=2 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory without matter give integral curves on the moduli space someof which are geodesics of the natural metric on the moduli space. In particularthe flow lines which cross-over from from the weak coupling limit(asymptotically free theory) to the singular points, representing the strongcoupling limit, are geodesics. A possible connection with irreversibility isdiscussed.
