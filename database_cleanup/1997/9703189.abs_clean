We present a complex matrix gauge model defined on an arbitrarytwo-dimensional orientable lattice. We rewrite the model's partition functionin terms of a sum over representations of the group U(N). The model solves thegeneral combinatorial problem of counting branched covers of orientable Riemannsurfaces with any given, fixed branch point structure. We then define anappropriate continuum limit allowing the branch points to freely float over thesurface. The simplest such limit reproduces two-dimensional chiral U(N)Yang-Mills theory and its string description due to Gross and Taylor.
