We introduce a classical field theory based on a concept of extendedcausality that mimics the causality of a point-particle Classical Mechanics byimposing constraints that are equivalent to a particle initial position andvelocity. It results on a description of discrete (pointwise) interactions interms of localized particle-like fields. We find the propagators of theseparticle-like fields and discuss their physical meaning, properties andconsequences. They are conformally invariant, singularity-free, and describinga manifestly covariant $(1+1)$-dimensional dynamics in a $(3+1)$ spacetime.Remarkably this conformal symmetry remains even for the propagation of amassive field in four spacetime dimensions. The standard formalism with itsdistributed fields is retrieved in terms of spacetime average of the discretefields. Singularities are the by-products of the averaging proccess. This newformalism enlightens the meaning and the problems of field theory, and mayallow a softer transition to a quantum theory.
