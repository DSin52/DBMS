Title: Planckian Energy Scattering of D-branes and M(atrix) Theory in Curved

SpaceComments: 5 pages, Latex

We argue that black p-branes will occur in the collision of D0-branes atPlanckian energies. This extents the Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano and 'tHooft conjecture that black holes occur in the collision of two light particlesat Planckian energies. We discuss a possible scenario for such a process byusing colliding plane gravitational waves. D-branes in the presence of blackholes are discussed. M(atrix) theory and matrix string in curved space areconsidered. A violation of quantum coherence in M(atrix) theory is noticed.
