The semi-classical spectrum of the Homogeneous sine-Gordon theoriesassociated with an arbitrary compact simple Lie group G is obtained and shownto be entirely given by solitons. These theories describe quantum integrablemassive perturbations of Gepner's G-parafermions whose classicalequations-of-motion are non-abelian affine Toda equations. One-solitonsolutions are constructed by embeddings of the SU(2) complex sine-Gordonsoliton in the regular SU(2) subgroups of G. The resulting spectrum exhibitsboth stable and unstable particles, which is a peculiar feature shared with thespectrum of monopoles and dyons in N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories.
