In this paper, we derive an expression for the grand canonical partitionfunction for a fluid of hot, rotating massless scalar field particles in theEinstein universe. We consider the number of states with a given energy as oneincreases the angular momentum so that the fluid rotates with an increasingangular velocity. We find that at the critical value when the velocity of theparticles furthest from the origin reaches the speed of light, the number ofstates tends to zero. We illustrate how one can also interpret this partitionfunction as the effective action for a boosted scalar field configuration inthe product of three dimensional de Sitter space and $S^1$. In this case, weconsider the number of states with a fixed linear momentum around the $S^1$ asthe particles are given more and more boost momentum. At the critical pointwhen the spacetime is about to develop closed timelike curves, the number ofstates again tends to zero. Thus it seems that quantum mechanics naturallyenforces the chronology protection conjecture by superselecting the causalityviolating field configurations from the quantum mechanical phase space.
