In this sequel calculation of the one-loop Feynman integral pertaining to amassive box diagram contributing to the photon-photon scattering amplitude inquantum electrodynamics, we present the six solutions as yet unknown in theliterature. These six new solutions arise quite naturally in the context ofnegative dimensional integration approach, revealing a promising technique tohandle Feynman integrals.
