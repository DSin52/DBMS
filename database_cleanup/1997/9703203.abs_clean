ExtensionComments: 6 pages, latex, Volkov Memorial Proceedings

J.Wess,Springer-Verlag 1998, pag.166.We review here a path-integral approach to classical mechanics and explorethe geometrical meaning of this construction. In particular we bring to light auniversal hidden BRS invariance and its geometrical relevance for the Cartancalculus on symplectic manifolds. Together with this BRS invariance we alsoshow the presence of a universal hidden genuine non-relativistic supersymmetry.In an attempt to understand its geometry we make this susy local following theanalogous construction done for the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of Witten.
