We derive the explicit form, and discuss some properties of the modulidependent effective potential arising from M-theory compactified on $M_4 \timesX\times S^1 / Z_2 $, when one of the boundaries supports a strongly interactinggauge sector and induces gaugino condensation. We discuss the relation betweenthe explicit gaugino condensate and effective superpotential formulations andfind interesting differences with respect to the situation known from theweakly coupled heterotic string case. The moduli dependence of the effectivepotential turns out to be more complicated than expected, and perhaps offersnew clues to the stabilization problem.
