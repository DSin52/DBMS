Title: Assumption of nonvanishingness of vacuum expectation of the scalar field

for spontaneous symmetry breaking is superfluousAuthors: Yu Shi

Comments: Revtex, 6 pages, a revised version

For spontaneous breaking of global or gauge symmetry, it is superfluous toassume that the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field manifesting thesymmetry is nonvanishing. The vacuum with spontaneous symmetry breaking simplycorresponds to nonzero number of particles of one or more components of thereal scalar field.
