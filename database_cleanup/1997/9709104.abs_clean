``Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries'', Dubna, Russia, July 22 - 26,1997, LaTeX, 1 figurePreliminary evidence is presented that a long overlooked and critical elementin the fundamental definition of a general theory of integration over curvedWess-Zumino superspace lies with the imposition of ``the Ethereal Conjecture''which states the necessity of the superspace to be topologically ``close'' toits purely bosonic sub-manifold. As a step in proving this, a new theory ofintegration of closed super p-forms is proposed.
