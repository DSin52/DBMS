I discuss the relation between M-theory and M(atrix)-theory in flat space byconsidering the effective potential for the scattering of two groups ofD0-branes in both theories. An explicit calculation of this potential up to twoloop order in M(atrix)-theory reveals a fascinating agreement. Lecture given atStrings '97; June 17, 1997.
