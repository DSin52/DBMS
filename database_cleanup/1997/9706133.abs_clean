An algebraic cohomological characterization of a class of linearly brokenWard identities is provided. The examples of the topological vectorsupersymmetry and of the Landau ghost equation are discussed in detail. Theexistence of such a linearly broken Ward identities turns out to be related toBRST exact antifield dependent cocycles with negative ghost number.
