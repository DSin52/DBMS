The mechanism of a confining medium is investigated within theNambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) approach. It is shown that a confining medium can berealized in the bosonized phase of the NJL model due to vacuum fluctuations ofboth fermion and Higgs (scalar fermion-antifermion collective excitation)fields. In such an approach there is no need to introduce Dirac strings.
