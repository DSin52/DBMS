Title: A black hole in two-dimensional space-time

Authors: F. Vendrell

Comments: 12 pages, Revtex, 2 figures

An imploding shell of radiation is shown to create a 2-D black hole withinthe framework of the ``R=T'' theory. The radius of the horizon is given by1/(2M), where M is the mass of the black hole. The topology of the centralsingularity is that of a corner. The radiation emitted very far from the blackhole is thermal with temperature M/(2\pi). The back-reaction problem is solvedto one-loop order.
