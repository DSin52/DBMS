By identifying the moduli space of coupling constants in the SYM descriptionof toroidal compactifications of M(atrix)-Theory, we construct the M(atrix)description of the moduli spaces of Type IIA string theory compactified on T^n.Addition of theta terms to the M(atrix) SYM produces the shift symmetriesnecessary to recover the correct global structure of the moduli spaces. Up ton=3, the corresponding BPS charges transform under the proper representationsof the U-duality groups. For n=4,5, if we make the ansatz of including the BPScharges corresponding to the wrapped M-theory 5-brane, the correspondence withType IIA continues to hold. However, for n=6, we find additional charges forwhich there are no obvious candidates in M(atrix)-Theory.
