We present a construction in Matrix theory of longitudinal 5-branes whosegeometry in transverse space corresponds to a 4-sphere. We describe thesebranes through an explicit construction in terms of N*N matrices for aparticular infinite series of values of N. The matrices used in theconstruction have a number of properties which can be interpreted in terms ofthe 4-sphere geometry, in analogy with similar properties of the SU(2)generators used in the construction of a spherical membrane. The physicalproperties of these systems correspond with those expected from M-theory; inparticular, these objects have an energy and a leading long-distanceinteraction with gravitons which agrees with 11D supergravity at leading orderin N.
