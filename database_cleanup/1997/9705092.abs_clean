Authors: John H. Schwarz

Comments: 13 pages, latex, no figures; ICTP Conference Proceedings

Brane actions with chiral bosons present special challenges. Recent progressin the description of the two main examples -- the M theory five-brane and theheterotic string -- is described. Also, double dimensional reduction of the Mtheory five-brane on K3 is shown to give the heterotic string.
