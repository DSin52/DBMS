In this article, we will discuss geometric quantization of 2d QCD withfermionic and bosonic matter fields. We identify the respective large-N_c phasespaces as the infinite dimensional Grassmannian and the infinite dimensionalDisc. The Hamiltonians are quadratic functions, and the resulting equations ofmotion for these classical systems are nonlinear. In a previous publication,the first author has shown that the linearization of the equations of motionfor the Grassmannian gave the `t Hooft equation. We will see that thelinearization in the bosonic case leads to the scalar analog of the `t Hooftequation found by Tomaras.
