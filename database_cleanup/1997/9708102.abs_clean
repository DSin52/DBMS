When graviton loops are taken into account, the background metric obtained asa solution to the one-loop corrected Einstein equations turns out to be gaugefixing dependent. Therefore it is of no physical relevance. Instead we considera physical observable, namely the trajectory of a test particle in the presenceof gravitons. We derive a quantum corrected geodesic equation that includesbackreaction effects and is explicitly independent of any gauge fixingparameter.
