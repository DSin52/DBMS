We determine the boundary state for both the NS-NS and R-R sectors ofsuperstring theory. We show how they are modified under a boost. The boostedboundary state is then used for computing the interaction of two D-branesmoving with constant velocity reproducing with a completely different method arecent calculation by Bachas.
