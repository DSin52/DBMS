Although axial QED suffers from a gauge anomaly, gauge invariance may bemaintained by the addition of a nonlocal counterterm. Such nonlocalconterterms, however, are expected to ruin unitarity of the theory. Weexplicitly investigate some relevant Feynman diagrams and show that, indeed,unitarity is violated, contrary to recent claims.
