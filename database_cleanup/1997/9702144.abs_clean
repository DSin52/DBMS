Infinite-dimensional algebras of hidden symmetries of the self-dualYang-Mills equations are considered. A current-type algebra of symmetries andan affine extension of conformal symmetries introduced recently are discussedusing the twistor picture. It is shown that the extended conformal symmetriesof the self-dual Yang-Mills equations have a simple description in terms ofWard's twistor construction.
