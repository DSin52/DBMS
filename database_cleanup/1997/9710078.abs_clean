We investigate D-brane instanton contributions to R^4 couplings in anytoroidal compactification of type II theories. Starting from the 11Dsupergravity one-loop four-graviton amplitude computed by Green, Gutperle andVanhove, we derive the non-perturbative O(e^{-1/\lambda}) corrections to R^4couplings by a sequence of T-dualities, and interpret them as preciseconfigurations of bound states of D-branes wrapping cycles of thecompactification torus. Dp-branes explicitely appear as fluxes onD(p+2)-branes, and as gauge instantons on D(p+4)-branes. Specific rules forweighting these contributions are obtained, which should carry over to moregeneral situations. Furthermore, it is shown that U-duality in D<=6 relatesthese D-brane configurations to O(e^{-1/\lambda^2}) instantons for which ageometric interpretation is still lacking.
