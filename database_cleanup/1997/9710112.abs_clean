The constraints of N=2 supersymmetry, in combination with several other quitegeneral assumptions, have recently been used to show that N=2 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory has a low energy quantum parameter space symmetrycharacterised by the discrete group $\gu$. We show that if one also assumes thecommutativity of renormalization group flow with the action of this group onthe complexified coupling constant $\ta$, then this is sufficient to determinethe non-perturbative $\beta$-function, given knowledge of its weak couplingbehaviour. The result coincides with the outcome of direct calculations fromthe Seiberg-Witten solution.
