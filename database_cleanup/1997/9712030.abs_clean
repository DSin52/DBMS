Boundary equations for the relativistic string with masses at ends areformulated in terms of geometrical invariants of world trajectories of massesat the string ends. In the three-dimensional Minkowski space $E^1_2$, there aretwo invariants of that sort, the curvature $K$ and torsion $\kappa$. For theseequations of motion with periodic $\kappa_i(\tau+n l)=\kappa(\tau)$, constantsof motion are obtained.
