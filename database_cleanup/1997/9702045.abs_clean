Near extreme black holes can lose their charge and decay by the emission ofmassive BPS charged particles. We calculate the greybody factors for low energycharged and neutral scalar emission from four and five dimensional nearextremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. We use the corresponding emissionrates to obtain ratios of the rates of loss of excess energy by charged andneutral emission, which are moduli independent, depending only on the integralcharges and the horizon potentials. We consider scattering experiments, findingthat evolution towards a state in which the integral charges are equal isfavoured, but neutral emission will dominate the decay back to extremalityexcept when one charge is much greater than the others. The implications of ourresults for the agreement between black hole and D-brane emission rates and forthe information loss puzzle are then discussed.
