We study the structure of the moduli spaces of vacua and superpotentials ofN=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in three dimensions. By analyzing theinstanton corrections, we compute the exact superpotentials and determine thequantum Coulomb and Higgs branches of the theories in the weak couplingregions. We find candidates for non-trivial N=2 superconformal field theoriesat the singularities of the moduli spaces. The analysis is carried outexplicitly for gauge groups U(N_c) and SU(N_c) with N_f flavors. We show thatthe field theory results are in complete agreement with the intersecting branespicture. We also compute the exact superpotentials for arbitrary gauge groupsand arbitrary matter content.
