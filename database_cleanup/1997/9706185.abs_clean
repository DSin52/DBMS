Type-IIB supersymmetric theories have an SL(2,Z) invariance, known asU-duality, which controls the non-perturbative behavior of the theory. UnderSL(2,Z) the supercharges are doublets, implying that the bosonic charges wouldbe singlets or triplets. However, among the bosonic charges there are doubletstrings and doublet fivebranes which are in conflict with the doublet propertyof the supercharges. It is shown that the conflict is resolved by structureconstants that depend on moduli, such as the tau parameter, which transformunder the same SL(2,Z). The resulting superalgebra encodes the non-perturbativeduality properties of the theory and is valid for any value of the stringcoupling constant. The usefulness of the formalism is illustrated by applyingit to purely algebraic computations of the tension of (p,q) strings, and themass and entropy of extremal blackholes constructed from D-1-branes andD-5-branes. In the latter case the non-perturbative coupling dependence of theBPS mass and metric is computed for the first time in this paper. It is furtherargued that the moduli dependence of the superalgebra provides hints for fourmore dimensions beyond ten, such that the superalgebra is embedded in afundamental theory which would be covariant under SO(11,3). An outline is givenfor a matrix theory in 14 dimensions that would be consistent with M(atrix)theory as well as with the above observations.
