In this article we propose a `second quantization' scheme especially suitableto deal with non-trivial, highly symmetric phase spaces, implemented within amore general Group Approach to Quantization, which recovers the standardQuantum Field Theory (QFT) for ordinary relativistic linear fields. Weemphasize, among its main virtues, greater suitability in characterizing vacuumstates in a QFT on a highly symmetric curved space-time and the absence of theusual requirement of global hyperbolicity. This can be achieved in the specialcase of the Anti-de Sitter universe, on which we explicitly construct a QFT.
