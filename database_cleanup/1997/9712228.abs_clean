We derive the classical transport equation, in scalar field theory with aV(phi) interaction, from the equation of motion for the quantum field. Weobtain a very simple, but iterative, expression for the effective action whichgenerates all the n-point Green functions in the high-temperature limit. Anexplicit closed form is given in the static case.
