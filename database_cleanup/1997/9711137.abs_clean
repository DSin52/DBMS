The problem of gauge invariance of the physical sector of (2+1)-dimensionalMaxwell-Chern-Simons quantum electrodynamics (QED$_{2+1}$) is studied. It isshown that using Proca mass term for the infrared regularization one obtainsgauge-invariant fermion mass and the physical mass shell of QED$_{2+1}$ iswell-defined in all orders of the perturbation theory. We are demonstratingalso a class of gauges in the framework of QED$_{2+1}$, including transversaland Feynman-like ones, where the physical sector is well defined andindependent of the gauge parameter.
