The canonical description is presented for the string with pointlike massesand in the light cone one. The classical canonical transformation is writtenout explicitly, which relates physical variables in both gauges, andequivalence of two classical theories is demonstrated in such a way. Boththeories are quantized, and it is shown that quantum theories are not unitaryequivalent. It happens due to the fact that the canonical transformationdepends on interaction. The quantum Poincare algebra proves to be closed inboth cases, so that the requirement of Poincare covariance is not able todistinguish between two versions of the theory.
