A recent construction of the electroweak theory, based on perturbativequantum gauge invariance alone, is extended to the case of more generations offermions with arbitrary mixing. The conditions implied by second order gaugeinvariance lead to an isolated solution for the fermionic couplings inagreement with the standard model. Third order gauge invariance determines theHiggs potential. The resulting massive gauge theory is manifestly gaugeinvariant, after construction.
