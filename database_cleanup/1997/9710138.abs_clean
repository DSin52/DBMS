Authors: Debashis Gangopadhyay and Soumitra Sengupta

Comments: latex, 13 pages

We construct new maximally symmetric solutions for the metric. We then showthat for a string moving in a background consisting of maximally symmetricgravity, dilaton field and second rank antisymmetric tensor field, the O(d)$\otimes$ O(d) transformation on the vacuum solutions, in general, givesinequivalent solutions that are not maximally symmetric.
