We derive the (matrix-valued) Feynman rules of the mass perturbation theoryand use it for the resummation of the $n$-point functions with the help of theDyson-Schwinger equations. We use these results for a short review of thecomplete spectrum of the model and for a discussion of scattering processes. Wefind that in scattering cross sections all the resonances and higher particleproduction thresholds of the model are properly taken into account by ourresummed mass perturbation theory, without the need of further approximations.
