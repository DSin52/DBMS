Title: Flat Symplectic Bundles of N-Extended Supergravities, Central Charges

and Black-Hole EntropyAuthors: L. Andrianopoli, R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara

Comments: Based on lectures given by S. Ferrara at the 5th Winter School on

Mathematical Physics held at the Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics,Seul (Korea), February 1997In these lectures we give a geometrical formulation of N-extendedsupergravities which generalizes N=2 special geometry of N=2 theories. In allthese theories duality symmetries are related to the notion of "flat symplecticbundles" and central charges may be defined as "sections" over these bundles.Attractor points giving rise to "fixed scalars" of the horizon geometry andBekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for extremal black-holes are discussed insome details.
