Tree level decay amplitudes of near-BPS D-brane configurations are known toexactly reproduce Hawking radiation rates from corresponding black holes at lowenergies even though the brane configurations describe semiclassical blackholes only when the open string couplings are large. We show that a large classof one (open string) loop corrections to emission processes from D-branesvanish at low energies and nonvanishing loop contributions have an energydependence consistent with black hole answers, thus providing a justificationfor the agreement of the tree level results with semiclassical answers.
