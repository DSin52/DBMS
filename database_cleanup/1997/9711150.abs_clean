We construct an RG potential for N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theory,and extract a positive definite metric by comparing its gradient with therecently discovered beta-function for this system, thus proving that the RGflow is gradient in this four-dimensional field theory. We also discuss howthis flow might change after supersymmetry breaking, provided the quantumsymmetry group does not, emphasizing the non-trivial problem of asymptoticmatching of automorphic functions to perturbation theory.
