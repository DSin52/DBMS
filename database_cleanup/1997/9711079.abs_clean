A 3-dimensional non-abelian gauge theory was proposed by Jackiw and Pi tocreate mass for the gauge fields. However, the quadratic action obtained byswitching off the non-abelian interactions possesses more gauge symmetries thanthe original one, causing some difficulties in quantization. Jackiw and Piproposed another action by introducing new fields, whose gauge symmetries areconsistent with the quadratic part. It is shown that all of these theories havethe same number of physical degrees of freedom in the hamiltonian framework.Hence, as far as the physical states are considered there is no inconsistency.Nevertheless, perturbation expansion is still problematic. To cure this wepropose to modify one of the constraints of the non-abelian theory withoutaltering neither its canonical hamiltonian nor the number of physical states.
