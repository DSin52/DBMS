Title: One-Loop Free Energy of the Four-Dimensional Compact QED in the

Confining PhaseComments: 4 pages, LaTeX, no figures

The one-loop free energy of the four-dimensional compact QED, which is knownto be equivalent to the vector Sine-Gordon model, is calculated in the strongcoupling regime. In the case, when the norm of the strength tensor of thesaddle-point value of the corresponding Sine-Gordon model is much larger thanthe typical inverse area of a loop in the gas of the monopole rings, theobtained free energy decays exponentially versus this norm. In the oppositecase, when the dominant configuration of the Sine-Gordon model is identicallyzero, the resulting free energy decays with the growth of loops as an exponentof the inverse square of their typical area.
