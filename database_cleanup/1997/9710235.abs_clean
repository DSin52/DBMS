The properties of the ground state wavefunctional in gluodynamics responsiblefor confinement are considered. It is shown that confinement arises due to thegeneration of a mass gap in the averaging over the gauge group which isnecessary to ensure the gauge invariance of the ground state. The stringtension is calculated in assumption of a particular infrared behavior of thevacuum wavefunctional.
