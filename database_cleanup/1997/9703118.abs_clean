T-duality on 2-torus and a correction in figure 2. Latex, 42 pages. Lecturesgiven at the APCTP Winter School "Dualities of Gauge and String Theories",Korea, February 1997This is an introductory review on the eleven-dimensional description of theBPS bound states of type II superstring theories, and on the role ofsupermembranes in M-theory. The first part describes classical solutions of 11dsupergravity which upon dimensional reduction and T-dualities give bound statesof NS-NS and R-R p-branes of type IIA and IIB string theories. In some cases(e.g. (q_1,q_2) string bound states of type IIB string theory), thesenon-perturbative objects admit a simple eleven-dimensional description in termsof a fundamental 2-brane. The BPS excitations of such 2-brane are calculatedand shown to exactly match the mass spectrum for the BPS (q_1,q_2) string boundstates. Different 11d representations of the same bound state can be used toprovide inequivalent (T-dual) descriptions of the oscillating BPS states. Thispermits to test T-duality beyond perturbation theory and, in certain cases, toevade membrane instabilities by going to a stable T-dual representation. Wefinally summarize the results indicating in what regions of the modularparameter space a supermembrane description for M-theory on R^9 x T^2 seems tobe adequate.
