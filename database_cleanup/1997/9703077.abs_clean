We present a solution of M(atrix) theory describing type IIA fundamentalstring. Our construction is based on the central charge of the longitudinalmembrane (= fundamental string), the BPS saturation condition and the relationbetween M(atrix) theory and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The fundamentalstring corresponds to a photon in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
