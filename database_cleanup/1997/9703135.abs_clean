Bialek, Callan and Strong have recently given a solution of the problem ofdetermining a continuous probability distribution from a finite set ofexperimental measurements by formulating it as a one-dimensional quantum fieldtheory. This letter gives a reparametrization-invariant solution of theproblem, obtained by coupling to gravity. The case of a large number ofdimensions may involve quantum gravity restricted to metrics of vanishing Weylcurvature.
