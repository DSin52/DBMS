We present a superfield formulation of the quantization program for theorieswith first class constraints. An exact operator formulation is given, and weshow how to set up a phase-space path integral entirely in terms ofsuperfields. BRST transformations and canonical transformations enter on equalfooting, and they allow us to establish a superspace analog of the BFV theorem.We also present a formal derivation of the Lagrangian superfield analogue ofthe field-antifield formalism, by an integration over half of the phase-spacevariables.
