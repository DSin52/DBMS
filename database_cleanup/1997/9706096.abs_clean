We discuss the T-duality between the solutions of type IIA versus IIBsuperstrings compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Within the context of theN=2, D=4 supergravity effective Lagrangian, the T-duality transformation isequivalently described by the c-map, which relates the special Kahler modulispace of the IIA N=2 vector multiplets to the quaternionic moduli space of theN=2 hyper multiplets on the type IIB side (and vice versa). Hence theT-duality, or c-map respectively, transforms the IIA black hole solutions,originating from even dimensional IIA branes, of the special Kahler effectiveaction, into IIB D-instanton solutions of the IIB quaternionic sigma-modelaction, where the D-instantons can be obtained by compactifying odd IIBD-branes on the internal Calabi-Yau space. We construct via this mapping abroad class of D-instanton solutions in four dimensions which are determindedby a set of harmonic functions plus the underlying topological Calabi-Yau data.
