We use dimensional reduction techniques to relate real time finite Tcorrelation functions in (2+1) dimensional QCD to bound state parameters in ageneralized 't Hooft model with an infinite number of heavy quark and adjointscalar fields. While static susceptibilities and correlation functions of theDeTar type can be calculated using only the light (static) gluonic modes, thedynamical correlators require the inclusion of the heavy modes. In particularwe demonstrate that the leading T perturbative result can be understood interms of the bound states of the 2d model and that consistency requires boundstate trajectories composed of both quarks and adjoint scalars. We also proposea non-perturbative expression for the dynamical DeTar correlators at smallspatial momenta.
