The canonical quantum theory of a free field using arbitrary foliations of aflat two-dimensional spacetime is investigated. It is shown that dynamicalevolution along arbitrary spacelike foliations is unitarily implemented on thesame Fock space as that associated with inertial foliations. It follows thatthe Schrodinger picture exists for arbitrary foliations as a unitary image ofthe Heisenberg picture for the theory. An explicit construction of theSchrodinger picture image of the Heisenberg Fock space states is provided. Theresults presented here can be interpreted in terms of a Dirac constraintquantization of parametrized field theory. In particular, it is shown that theSchrodinger picture physical states satisfy a functional Schrodinger equationwhich includes a slice-dependent c-number quantum correction, in accord with aproposal of Kuchar. The spatial diffeomorphism invariance of the Schrodingerpicture physical states is established. Fundamental difficulties arise whentrying to generalize these results to higher-dimensional spacetimes.
