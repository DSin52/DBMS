We calculate the instanton corrections in the effective prepotential for N=2supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with all A-D-E gauge groups from theSeiberg-Witten geometry constructed out of the spectral curves of the affineToda lattice. The one-instanton contribution is determined explicitly bysolving the Gauss-Manin system associated with the A-D-E singularity. Ourresults are in complete agreement with the ones obtained from the microscopicinstanton calculations.
