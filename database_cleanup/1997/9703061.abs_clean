Title: Further illustration of the use of the Frobenius-Schwinger-Dyson

equationsComments: 10 pages Latex

The Frobenius-Schwinger-Dyson equations are a rather high-brow abstractnonsense type of equations describing n-point functions of arbitrarily highcomposite insertions. It is not clear how to solve or even find approximatesolutions of these equations in general, but they are worth investigatingbecause (a certain preferred type of) renormalization of composite insertionsaction and renormalization conditions. Earlier work in this field involved onlyGaussian actions or variable transformations thereof. In this work weillustrate the use of Frobenius-Schwinger-Dyson at a less obviously triviallevel, that of the Thirring model.
