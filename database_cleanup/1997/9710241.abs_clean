The relative entropy in two-dimensional Field Theory is studied for itsapplication as an irreversible quantity under the Renormalization Group,relying on a general monotonicity theorem for that quantity previouslyestablished. In the cylinder geometry, interpreted as finite-temperature fieldtheory, one can define from the relative entropy a monotonic quantity similarto Zamolodchikov's c function. On the other hand, the one-dimensional quantumthermodynamic entropy also leads to a monotonic quantity, with differentproperties. The relation of thermodynamic quantities with the complexcomponents of the stress tensor is also established and hence the entropic ctheorems are proposed as analogues of Zamolodchikov's c theorem for thecylinder geometry.
