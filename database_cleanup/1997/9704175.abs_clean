Title: Solving the Graceful Exit Problem in Superstring Cosmology

Pune, India)Comments: 8 pages, RevTex. Based on talk given at Conference on Big Bang and

1997We briefly review the status of the ``graceful exit'' problem in superstringcosmology and present a possible resolution. It is shown that there exists asolution to this problem in two-dimensional dilaton gravity provided quantumcorrections are incorporated. This is similar to the recently proposed solutionof Rey. However, unlike in his case, in our one-loop corrected model thegraceful exit problem is solved for any finite number of massless scalar matterfields present in the theory.
