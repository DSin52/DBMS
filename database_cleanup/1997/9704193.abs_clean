After a review of theoretical motivations to consider theories with directcouplings of scalar fields to Ricci and gauge curvature terms, we consider thedynamics and non-perturbative stabilization of a dilaton in three and in fourdimensions. In particular, we derive generalized Coulomb potentials in thepresence of a dilaton and discuss a low energy effective dilaton potentialinduced by instanton effects and the S--dual coupling to axions. We concludewith a discussion of cosmological implications of a light dilaton.
