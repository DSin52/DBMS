I consider N=1 supersymmetric SU(N_c) gauge theories with matter fieldsconsisting of one antisymmetric representation, five flavors, and enoughanti-fundamental representations to cancel the gauge anomaly. Previous analysesare extended to the case of even N_c with no superpotential. Using holomorphy Ishow that the theory has an interacting infrared fixed point for sufficientlylarge N_c. These theories are interesting due to the fact that in going fromfive to four flavors the theory goes from a non-trivial infrared fixed point toconfinement, in contradistinction to SUSY QCD, but in analogy to the behaviorexpected in non-SUSY QCD.
