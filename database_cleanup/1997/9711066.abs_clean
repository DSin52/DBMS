A C*-algebra containing the CCR and CAR algebras as its subalgebras andnaturally described as the semidirect product of these algebras is discussed. Aparticular example of this structure is considered as a model for the algebraof asymptotic fields in quantum electrodynamics, in which Gauss' law isrespected. The appearence in this algebra of a phase variable related toelectromagnetic potential leads to the universal charge quantization.Translationally covariant representations of this algebra with energy-momentumspectrum in the future lightcone are investigated. It is shown that vacuumrepresentations are necessarily nonregular with respect to totalelectromagnetic field. However, a class of translationally covariant,irreducible representations is constructed excplicitly, which remain as closeas possible to the vacuum, but are regular at the same time. The spectrum ofenergy-momentum fills the whole future lightcone, but there are no vectors withenergy-momentum lying on a mass hyperboloid or in the origin.
