Using M(atrix) Theory, the dualities of toroidally compactified M-theory canbe formulated as properties of super Yang Mills theories in various dimensions.We consider the cases of compactification on one, two, three, four and fivedimensional tori. The dualities required by string theory lead to conjecturesof remarkable symmetries and relations between field theories as well asextremely unusual dynamical properties. By studying the theories in the limitof vanishingly small tori, a wealth of information is obtained about stronglycoupled fixed points of super Yang-Mills theories in various dimensions.Perhaps the most striking behavior, as noted by Rozali in this context, is theemergence of an additional dimension of space in the case of a four torus.
