We consider a 1+1 dimensional field theory which contains both a complexfermion field and a real scalar field. We then construct a unitary operatorthat, by a similarity transformation, gives a continuum of equivalent theorieswhich smoothly interpolate between the massive Thirring model and thesine-Gordon model. This provides an implementation of smooth bosonizationproposed by Damgaard et al. as well as an example of a quantum canonicaltransformation for a quantum field theory.
