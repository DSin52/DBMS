We discuss exact renormalization group (RG) in $R^2$-gravity using effectiveaverage action formalism. The truncated evolution equation for such a theory onDe Sitter background leads to the system of nonperturbative RG equations forcosmological and gravitational coupling constants. Approximate solution ofthese RG equations shows the appearence of antiscreening and screeningbehaviour of Newtonian coupling what depends on higher derivative couplingconstants.
