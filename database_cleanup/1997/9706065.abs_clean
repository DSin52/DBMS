Using standard coordinates, the Maxwell equations in the Reissner-Nordstr\"omgeometry are written in terms of a couple of scalar fields satisfyingKlein-Gordon like equations. The density of states is derived in thesemi-classical approximation and the first quantum corrections to the blackhole entropy is computed by using the brick-wall model.
