Title: On the Role of the Annihilation Channel in Front Form Positronium

Authors: Uwe Trittmann (Max-Planck-Institut fuer Kernphysik, Heidelberg)

Comments: 9 pp., ReVTeX

The annihilation channel is implemented into the front form calculations ofthe positronium spectrum presented in a previous publication. The effectiveHamiltonian is calculated analytically. Its eigensolutions are obtainednumerically. A complete separation of the dynamical and instantaneous part ofthe annihilation interaction is observed. We find the remarkable effect thatthe annihilation channel stabilizes the cutoff behavior of the spectrum.
