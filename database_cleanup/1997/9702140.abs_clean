Title: Subtleties in the Light-Cone Representation

Comments: 7 pages, Latex, uses sprocl.sty

To produce an isomorphism between the light-cone and equal-timerepresentations some additional formalism beyond that originally proposed forthe light-cone representation may sometimes be required. The additionalformalism usually involves zero modes and is most likely to affect delicate,high energy aspects of the solution such as condensates. In this talk I willreview some of the information which has been obtained in the past few years onthese issues with particular emphasis on the Schwinger model as an example.
