We study the bosonic super Liouville system which is a statisticaltransmutation of super Liouville system. Lax pair for the bosonic superLiouville system is constructed using prolongation method, ensuring the Laxintegrability, and the solution to the equations of motion is also consideredvia Leznov-Saveliev analysis.
