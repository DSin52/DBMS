Jacobi brackets (a generalization of standard Poisson brackets in whichLeibniz's rule is replaced by a weaker condition) are extended to bracketsinvolving an arbitrary (even) number of functions. This new structure includes,as a particular case, the recently introduced generalized Poisson structures.The linear case on simple group manifolds is also studied and non-trivialexamples (different from those coming from generalized Poisson structures) ofthis new construction are found by using the cohomology ring of the givengroup.
