We analyze in detail the anomaly cancellation conditions for the stronglycoupled $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string introduced by Horava and Witten andfind new features compared to the ten-dimensional Green-Schwarz mechanism. Weproject onto ten dimensions the corresponding Lagrangian of the zero-modefields. We find that it has a simple interpretation provided by the conjecturedheterotic string/fivebrane duality. The part which originates fromeleven-dimensions is naturally described in fivebrane language. We discussphysical couplings and scales in four dimensions.
