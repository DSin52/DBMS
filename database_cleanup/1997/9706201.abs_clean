A magnetic field, coherent over the horizon size at the decoupling and strongenough to rotate the polarization plane of the CMBR, can be generated from theelectromagnetic vacuum fluctuations amplified by the space-time evolution ofthe dilaton coupling. The possible relevance of this result for superstringinspired cosmological models is discussed. Particular attention will be paid tothe connection between Faraday rotation signals and stochastic gravity-wavebackgrounds.
