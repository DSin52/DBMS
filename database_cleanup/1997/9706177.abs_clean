Title: Strings and matrix models on genus g Riemann Surfaces

Comments: TeX file, 7 pages

This is a summary of old work on connections between discrete area preservingdiffeomorphisms, reduced SU(N) Yang-Mills, strings, and the quantum Hall effecton a Riemann surface of genus g. It is submitted to the archives due to theinterest expressed by colleagues who are currently working on matrix models,and who could not have access to the proceedings in which the article waspublished. The text that follows is the version published in 1991.
