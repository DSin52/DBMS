We study low-energy effective superpotentials for the phase with a confinedphoton in N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with an adjoint matter $\Phi$ andfundamental flavors $Q, \tilde Q$. Arbitrary classical gauge groups areconsidered. The results are used to derive the hyperelliptic curves whichdescribe the Coulomb phase of N=2 supersymmetric QCD with classical gaugegroups. These curves are in agreement with those proposed earlier by severalauthors. Our results also produce the curves relevant to describe the Coulombphase of N=1 theories with a superpotential of the form $\tilde{Q} \Phi^{l} Q$.
