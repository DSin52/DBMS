Using the nonperturbative Schwinger-Dyson equation, we show that chiralsymmetry is dynamically broken in QED at weak couplings when an externalmagnetic field is present, and that chiral symmetry is restored at temperaturesabove $T_c \simeq \alpha\pi^2/\sqrt{2 \pi |eH|}$, where $\alpha$ isthe fine structure constant and $H$ is the magnetic field strength.
