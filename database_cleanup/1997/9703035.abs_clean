We consider a parabolic-like systems of differential equations involvinggeometrical quantities to examine uniformization theorems for two- andthree-dimensional closed orientable manifolds. We find that in thetwo-dimensional case there is a simple gauge theoretic flow for a connectionbuilt from a Riemannian structure, and that the convergence of the flow to thefixed points is consistent with the Poincare Uniformization Theorem. Weconstruct a similar system for the three-dimensional case. Here the connectionis built from a Riemannian geometry, an SO(3) connection and two other 1-formfields which take their values in the SO(3) algebra. The flat connectionsinclude the eight homogeneous geometries relevant to the three-dimensionaluniformization theorem conjectured by W. Thurston. The fixed points of the flowinclude, besides the flat connections (and their local deformations), non-flatsolutions of the Yang-Mills equations. These latter "instanton" configurationsmay be relevant to the fact that generic 3-manifolds do not admit one of thehomogeneous geometries, but may be decomposed into "simple 3-manifolds" whichdo.
