We prove that the Calogero-Sutherland Model with reflections (the BC_N model)possesses a property of duality relating the eigenfunctions of two Hamiltonianswith different coupling constants. We obtain a generating function for theirpolynomial eigenfunctions, the generalized Jacobi polynomials. The symmetry ofthe wave-functions for certain particular cases (associated to the root systemsof the classical Lie groups B_N, C_N and D_N) is also discussed.
