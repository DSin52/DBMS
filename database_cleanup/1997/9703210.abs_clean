Recently, a D-brane construction in type IIA string theory was shown to yieldthe electric/magnetic duality of four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric U(N_c)gauge theories with N_f flavours of quark. We present here an extension of thatconstruction which yields the electric/magnetic duality for the SO(N_c) andUSp(N_c) gauge theories with N_f quarks, by adding an orientifold plane whichis consistent with the supersymmetry. Due to the intersection of theorientifold plane with the NS-NS fivebranes already present, new features arisewhich are crucial in determining the correct final structure of the dualities.
