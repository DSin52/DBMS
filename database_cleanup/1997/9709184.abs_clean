250-270The general solution to the quantum master equation (and its $Sp(2)$symmetric counterpart) is constructed explicitly in case of finite number ofvariables. It is shown that the finite-dimensional solution is physicallytrivial and thus can not be extended directly to cover the case of a localfield theory. In this way we conclude that the locality condition plays animportant role by making it possible to obtain nontrivial physical results whenquantizing gauge field theories on the basis of field-antifield formalism.
