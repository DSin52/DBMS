The classification of the coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro algebra isreviewed and is then applied to analyze the so-called global Liouvilleequation. The review is self-contained, elementary and is tailor-made for theapplication. It is well-known that the Liouville equation for a smooth, realfield $\phi$ under periodic boundary condition is a reduction of the SL(2,R)WZNW model on the cylinder, where the WZNW field g in SL(2,R) is restricted tobe Gauss decomposable. If one drops this restriction, the Hamiltonian reductionyields, for the field $Q=\kappa g_{22}$ where $\kappa\neq 0$ is a constant,what we call the global Liouville equation. Corresponding to the winding numberof the SL(2,R) WZNW model there is a topological invariant in the reducedtheory, given by the number of zeros of Q over a period. By the substitution$Q=\pm\exp(- \phi/2)$, the Liouville theory for a smooth $\phi$ is recovered inthe trivial topological sector. The nontrivial topological sectors can beviewed as singular sectors of the Liouville theory that contain blowing-upsolutions in terms of $\phi$. Since the global Liouville equation isconformally invariant, its solutions can be described by explicitly listingthose solutions for which the stress-energy tensor belongs to a set ofrepresentatives of the Virasoro coadjoint orbits chosen by convention. Thisdirect method permits to study the `coadjoint orbit content' of the topologicalsectors as well as the behaviour of the energy in the sectors. The analysisconfirms that the trivial topological sector contains special orbits withhyperbolic monodromy and shows that the energy is bounded from below in thissector only.
