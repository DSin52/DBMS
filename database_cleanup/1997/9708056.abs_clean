The propagation of a massless field in attractive and repulsive potentials isconsidered. It is shown that though the group velocity in such potentials canbe larger than one, the wave front propagates with the speed of light. Alarger-than-one group velocity leads only to a strong deformation of the wavepacket. The results obtained are applied to the light propagation in agravitational field. An erroneous assertion concerning the last problem,recently made in the literature, is refuted.
