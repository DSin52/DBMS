Title: Dirac Operator and Spectral Geometry

Comments: 205 pages, plain Tex. In the revised version, section 6.3 has been

amendedThis paper is devoted to mathematical and physical properties of the Diracoperator and spectral geometry. Spin-structures in Lorentzian and Riemannianmanifolds, and the global theory of the Dirac operator, are first analyzed.Elliptic boundary-value problems, index problems for closed manifolds and formanifolds with boundary, Bott periodicity and K-theory are then presented. Thismakes it clear why the Dirac operator is the most fundamental, in the theory ofelliptic operators on manifolds. The topic of spectral geometry is developed bystudying non-local boundary conditions of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer type, andheat-kernel asymptotics for operators of Laplace type on manifolds withboundary. The emphasis is put on the functorial method, which studies thebehaviour of differential operators, boundary operators and heat-kernelcoefficients under conformal rescalings of the background metric. In the secondboundary conditions for massless spin-1/2 fields, massless spin-3/2 potentialson manifolds with boundary, geometric theory of massive spin-3/2 potentials,local boundary conditions in quantum supergravity, quark boundary conditions,one-loop quantum cosmology, conformally covariant operators and Euclideanquantum gravity.
