We introduce some techniques for making a more global analysis of theexistence of geodesics on a Seiberg-Witten Riemann surface with metric $ds^2 =|\lambda_{SW}|^2$. Because the existence of such geodesics implies theexistence of BPS states in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, one can usethese methods to study the BPS spectrum in various phases of the Yang-Millstheory. By way of illustration, we show how, using our new methods, one caneasily recover the known results for the N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) puregauge theory, and we show in detail how it also works for the N=2, SU(2)theory coupled to a massive adjoint matter multiplet.
