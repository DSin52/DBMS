We study BPS-saturated classical solutions for the world-sheet theory of aD-string in the presence of a point charge. These solutions are interpreted asdescribing planar 3-string junctions, which arise because the original D-stringis deformed by the presence of the inserted charge. We compute the angles ofthe junctions and show that the vector sum of string tensions is zero,confirming a conjecture of Schwarz that such configurations are BPS states.
