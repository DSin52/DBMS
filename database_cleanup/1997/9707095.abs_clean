We discuss the physics of four-dimensional compact U(1) lattice gauge theoryfrom the point of view of softly broken N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Millstheory. We provide arguments in favor of (pseudo-)critical mass exponents 1/3,5/11 and 1/2, in agreement with the values observed in the computersimulations. We also show that the J^{CP} assignment of some of the lowestlying states can be naturally explained.
