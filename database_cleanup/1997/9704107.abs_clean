on Supersymmetry and Quantum Field Theory, dedicated to the memory ofD.V.Volkov, Kharkov (Ukraine), January 5-7, 1997We briefly review the general structure of integrable particle theories in1+1 dimensions having N=1 supersymmetry. Examples are specific perturbedsuperconformal field theories (of Yang-Lee type) and the N=1 supersymmetricsine-Gordon theory. We comment on the modifications that are required when theN=1 supersymmetry algebra contains non-trivial topological charges.
