self-interacting (0,2) tensor multiplet with 32 worldvolume supersymmetries.The quadratic part of this action is shown to be invariant under rigidOSp(6,2|4) superconformal symmetry, with 16 supersymmetries and 16 specialsupersymmetries. We explore a deep relation between the superconformal symmetryon the worldvolume of the brane and symmetry of the near horizon anti-de Sitterinfinite throat geometry of the M 5-brane in space-time.
