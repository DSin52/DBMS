Italian Conference on General Relativity and Gravitational Physics, Rome,Italy, 23-27 Sep 1996The thermal partition functions of photons in any covariant gauge andgravitons in the harmonic gauge, propagating in a Rindler wedge, are computedusing a local zeta-function approach. The relation with the surface termspreviously obtained by D. Kabat is studied. The results are discussed inrelation to the quantum corrections to the black hole entropy.
