Title: p-brane solutions and Beltrami-Laplace operator

Comments: LaTeX, 11 pages, no figures, the correction of the mistake of initial

version, the addition of one necessary restrictionGeneralization of harmonic superposition rule for the case of dependentchoice of harmonic functions is given. Dependence of harmonic functions fromall (relative and overall) transverse coordinates is considered using theBeltrami-Laplace operator. Supersymmetry of IIB 10D supergravity solutions withonly non-vanished 5-form field and 11D supergravity solutions is discussed.
