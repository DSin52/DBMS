Title: Non-Equilibrium Time Evolution in Quantum Field Theory

Comments: 7 pages, LaTex

Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. E56 (1997) 2687-2690

The time development of equal-time correlation functions in quantum mechanicsand quantum field theory is described by an exact evolution equation forgenerating functionals. This permits a comparison between classical and quantumevolution in non-equilibrium systems.
