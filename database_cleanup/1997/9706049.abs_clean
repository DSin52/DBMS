We introduce a Wheeler-De Witt approach to quantum cosmology based on thelow-energy string effective action, with an effective dilaton potentialincluded to account for non-perturbative effects and, possibly, higher-ordercorrections. We classify, in particular, four different classes of scatteringprocesses in minisuperspace, and discuss their relevance for the solution ofthe graceful exit problem.
