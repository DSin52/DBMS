We study the Giddings-Strominger wormholes in string theories. We foundnegative modes among O(4)-symmetric fluctuations about the non-singularwormhole background. Hence the stringy wormhole contribution to the euclideanfunctional integral is purely imaginary. This means that the stringy wormholeis a bounce (not an instanton) and describes the nucleation and growth ofwormholes in the Minkowski spacetime.
