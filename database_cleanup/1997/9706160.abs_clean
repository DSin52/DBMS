For any principal bundle $P$, one can consider the subspace of the space ofconnections on its tangent bundle $TP$ given by the tangent bundle $T{\cal A}$of the space of connections ${\cal A}$ on $P$. The tangent gauge group actsfreely on $T{\cal A}$. Appropriate BRST operators are introduced for quantumfield theories that include as fields elements of $T{\cal A}$, as well astangent vectors to the space of curvatures. As the simplest application, theBRST symmetry of the so-called $BF$-Yang-Mills theory is described and therelevant gauge fixing conditions are analyzed. A brief account on thetopological $BF$ theories is also included and the relevant Batalin-Vilkoviskyoperator is described.
