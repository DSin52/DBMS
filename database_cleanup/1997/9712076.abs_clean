In the first part, theconsistency of the Chern-Simons field theories in this gauge is proven usingthe Dirac's canonical formalism for constrained systems. Despite the presenceof non-trivial self-interactions in the gauge fixed functional, it will beshown that the commutation relations between the fields are trivial at anyperturbative order in the absence of couplings with matter fields. If thesecouplings are present, instead, the commutation relations become ratherinvolved, but it is still possible to study their main properties and to showthat they vanish at the tree level. In the second part of the talk theperturbative aspects of Chern-Simons field theories in the Coulomb gauge willbe analysed. In particular, it will be shown by explicit computations and in aregularization independent way that there are no radiative contributions to the$n-$point correlation functions. Finally the Feynman rules in the Coulomb gaugewill be derived on a three dimensional manifold with a spatial section given bya closed and orientable Riemann surface.
