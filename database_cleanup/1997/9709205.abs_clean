Motion of a non-relativistic particle on a cone with a magnetic flux runningthrough the cone axis (a ``flux cone'') is studied. It is expressed as themotion of a particle moving on the Euclidean plane under the action of avelocity-dependent force. Probability fluid (``quantum flow'') associated witha particular stationary state is studied close to the singularity,demonstrating non trivial Aharonov-Bohm effects. For example, it is shown thatnear the singularity quantum flow departs from classical flow. In the contextof the hydrodynamical approach to quantum mechanics, quantum potential due tothe conical singularity is determined and the way it affects quantum flow isanalysed. It is shown that the winding number of classical orbits plays a rolein the description of the quantum flow. Connectivity of the configuration spaceis also discussed.
