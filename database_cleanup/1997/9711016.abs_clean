We investigate the effect of a constant external non-Abelian field on chiralsymmetry breaking in a (2+1)-dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and in 3D QCDby solving the gap equation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, and also by RGanalysis. In the (2+1)-dimensional NJL model chiral symmetry breaking occursfor any weak coupling constant but in 3D QCD catalysis of chiral symmetrybreaking does not occur.
