We study Abelian Chern-Simons field theories with matter fields and globalSU(N) symmetry in the presence of random weak quenched disorder. In the absenceof disorder these theories possess N=2 supersymmetric fixed points andN=1 supersymmetric fixed lines in the infra-red limit. We show thatalthough the presence of disorder forbids any supersymmetry of the bare action,infra-red stable supersymmetric fixed points and fixed lines are realized inthe disorder-averaged effective theories.
