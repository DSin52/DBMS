Utilizing the conformal-flatness nature of 3-dim. Anti-de Sitter (AdS_3)black hole solution of Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli, the quantisation ofconformally-coupled scalar and spinor fields in this background spacetime isexplicitly carried out. In particular, mode expansion forms and propagators ofthe fields are obtained in closed forms. The vacuum in this conformally-coupledfield theories in AdS_3 black hole spacetime, which is conformally-flat, is theconformal vacuum which is unique and has global meaning. This pointparticularly suggests that now the particle production by AdS_3 black holespacetime should be absent. General argument establishing the absence of realparticle creation by AdS_3 black hole spacetime for this case of conformaltriviality is provided. Then next, using the explicit mode expansion forms forconformally-coupled scalar and spinor fields, the bosonic and fermionicsuperradiances are examined and found to be absent confirming the expectation.
