Physical Review E, rapid communicationsWe present a numerical simulation of the scattering of a topological solitonoff finite size attractive impurities, repulsive impurities and a combinationof both. The attractive and attractive-repulsive cases show similar features tothose found for $\delta$ function type of impurities. For the repulsive case,corresponding to a finite width barrier, the soliton behaves completelyclassically. No tunneling occurs for sub-barrier kinetic energies despite theextended nature of the soliton.
