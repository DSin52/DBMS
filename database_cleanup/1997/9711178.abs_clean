We develop techniques to classify D- and F-flat directions for N=1supersymmetric string vacua of the perturbative heterotic string theory, whichpossess an anomalous U(1) gauge group at the tree level. Genus-one correctionsgenerate a Fayet-Iliopoulos term for the D-term of U(1)_A, which is canceled bynon-zero vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of certain massless multiplets insuch a way that the anomalous U(1) is broken, while maintaining the D- andF-flatness of the effective field theory. A systematic analysis of flatdirections is given for non-zero VEVs of non-Abelian singlets, and thetechniques are illustrated for a specific model. The approach sets the stage toclassify the D- and F-flat directions for a large class of perturbative stringvacua. This classification is a prerequisite to address systematically thephenomenological consequences of these models.
