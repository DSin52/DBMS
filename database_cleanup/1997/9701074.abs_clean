For slowly varying fields on the scale of the lightest mass the logarithm ofthe vacuum functional of a massive quantum field theory can be expanded interms of local functionals satisfying a form of the Schrodinger equation, theprincipal ingredient of which is a regulated functional Laplacian. We extend aprevious work to construct the next to leading order terms of the Laplacian forthe Schrodinger equation that acts on such local functionals. Like the leadingorder the next order is completely determined by imposing rotational invariancein the internal space together with closure of the Poincare algebra.
