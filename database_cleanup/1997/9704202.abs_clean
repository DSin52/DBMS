We apply a derivative expansion to the Legendre effective action flowequations of O(N) symmetric scalar field theory, making no other approximation.We calculate the critical exponents eta, nu, and omega at the both the leadingand second order of the expansion, associated to the three dimensionalWilson-Fisher fixed points, at various values of N. In addition, we show howthe derivative expansion reproduces exactly known results, at special valuesN=infinity,-2,-4, ... .
