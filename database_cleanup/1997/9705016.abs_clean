It has been shown recently that the toroidally compactified type IIB stringeffective action possesses an SL(2, R) invariance as a consequence of thecorresponding symmetry in ten dimensions when the self-dual five-form fieldstrength is set to zero. By working in the string frame we clarify how a Z$_2$subgroup of this SL(2, R) group responsible for producing the strong-weakcoupling duality in the ten dimensional theory produces the same symmetry forthe reduced theory. In the absence of the full covariant action of type IIBsupergravity theory, we show that the T-dual version of type IIA stringeffective action (including the R-R terms) in D=9 also possesses the SL(2, R)invariance indicating that this symmetry is present for the full type IIBstring effective action compactified on torus.
