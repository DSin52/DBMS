N=1 supersymmetric QCD is considered using the recently proposed picture ofit as the world volume theory of a single M-theory fivebrane with two of itsdimensions wrapped on a Riemann surface. The conditions under which a secondM-theory brane can be introduced preserving some supersymmetry are analysed.Such configurations represent BPS saturated extended objects in the quantumfield theory on the brane worldvolume. Formulae for the tension of theseextended objects are derived. An explicit intersecting fivebrane configurationis found which is interpreted as a BPS domain wall in 4-dimensional MQCD.
