In this paper we first consider the null-plane bound-state equation for a $q\bar q$ pair in 1+3 dimensions and in the lowest-order Tamm-Dancoffapproximation. Light-cone gauge is chosen with a causal prescription for thegauge pole in the propagator. Then we show that this equation, whendimensionally reduced to 1+1 dimensions, becomes 't Hooft's bound-stateequation, which is characterized by an $x^+$-instantaneous interaction. Thedeep reasons for this coincidence are carefully discussed.
