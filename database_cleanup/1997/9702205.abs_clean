We found BPS-saturated solutions of M-theory and Type II string theory whichcorrespond to (non-marginally) bound states of p-branes intersecting at anglesdifferent from pi/2. These solutions are obtained by starting with a BPSmarginally bound (orthogonally) intersecting configurations of two p-branes(e.g, two four-branes of Type II string theory), performing a boosttransformation at an angle with respect to the world-volume of theconfiguration, performing T-duality transformation along the boost-direction,S-duality transformation, and T- transformations along the directionperpendicular to the boost transformation. The resulting configuration isnon-marginally bound BPS-saturated solution whose static metric possesses theoff-diagonal term which cannot be removed by a coordinate transformation, andthus signifies an angle (different from pi/2) between the resultingintersecting p-branes. Additional new p-branes are bound to this configuration,in order to ensure the stability of such a static, tilted configuration.
