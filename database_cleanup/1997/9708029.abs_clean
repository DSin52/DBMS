Title: F and M Theories as Gauge Theories of Area Preserving Algebra

Comments: 9 pages,no figures

F theory and M theory are formulated as gauge theories of area preservingdiffeomorphism algebra. Our M theory is shown to be 1-brane formulation ratherthan 0-brane formulation of M theory of Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskindand the F theory is shown to be 1-brane formulation rather than -1-braneformulation of type IIB matrix theory of Ishibashi, Kawai, Kitazawa andTsuchiya.
