The N-extended self-dual supergravity in the ultra-hyperbolicfour-dimensional spacetime of kleinian signature (2+2) is given in theN-extended harmonic superspace. We reformulate the on-shell N-extendedself-dual supergravity constraints of Siegel to a `zero-curvature'representation, and solve all of them but one in terms of a single superfieldprepotential, by using a covariant Frobenius gauge in the Devchand-Ogievetskyapproach. An off-shell superspace action, whose equation of motion yields theremaining constraint, is found. Our manifestly Lorentz-covariant action inharmonic superspace is very similar to the non-covariant Chern-Simons-typeaction, which was proposed earlier by Siegel in the light-cone N=8 superspace.Our action is also invariant under the residual superdiffeomorphisms and theresidual local OSp(8|2) super-Lorentz rotations, which are left after imposingthe Frobenius gauge. The infinitesimal superfield parameters of the residualsymmetries are expressed in terms of independent analytic superfields.
