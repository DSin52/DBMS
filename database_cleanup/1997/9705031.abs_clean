5-brane configurations describing 5d field theories are promoted to an Mtheory description a la Witten in terms of polynomials in two complexvariables. The coefficients of the polynomials are the Coulomb branch. Thispicture resolves apparent singularities at vertices and reveals exponentiallysmall corrections. These corrections ask to be compared to world line instantoncorrections. From a different perspective this procedure may be used to definea diagrammatic representation of polynomials in two variables.
