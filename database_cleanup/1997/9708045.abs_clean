The classical and quantum aspects of planar Coulomb interactions have beenstudied in detail. In the classical scenario, Action Angle Variables areintroduced to handle relativistic corrections, in the scheme oftime-independent perturbation theory. Complications arising due to thelogarithmic nature of the potential are pointed out. In the quantum case,harmonic oscillator approximations are considered and effects of theperturbations on the excited (oscillator) states have been analysed. In boththe above cases, the known 3+1-dimensional analysis is carried through side byside, for a comparison with the 2+1-dimensional (planar) results.
