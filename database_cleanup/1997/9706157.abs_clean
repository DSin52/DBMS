Title: Black holes, string theory and quantum coherence

Authors: Daniele Amati (SISSA)

On the basis of recently discovered connections between D-branes and blackholes, I show how the information puzzle is solved by superstring theory as thefundamental theory of quantum gravity. The picture that emerges is that awell-defined quantum state does not give rise to a black hole even if theapparent distribution of energy, momenta, charges, etc. would predict one onclassical grounds. Indeed, geometry - general relativistic space timedescription - is unwarranted at the quantum microstate level. It is thedecoherence leading to macrostates (average over degenerate microstates) thatprovides - on the same token - the loss of quantum coherence, the emergence ofa space time description with causal properties and, thus, the formation of ablack hole and its Hawking evaporation
