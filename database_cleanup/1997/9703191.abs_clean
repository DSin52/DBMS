N=1, d=4 superconformal group is studied and its representations arediscussed. Under superconformal transformations, left invariant derivatives andsome class of superfields, including supercurrents, are shown to follow theserepresentations. In other words, these superfields are quasi-primary by analogywith two dimensional conformal field theory. Based on these results, we findthe general forms of the two-point and the three-point correlation functions ofthe quasi-primary superfields in a group theoretical way. In particular, weshow that the two-point function of the supercurrent is unique up to a constantand the general form of the three-point function of the supercurrent has twofree parameters.
