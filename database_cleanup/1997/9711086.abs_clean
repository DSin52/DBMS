We discuss charged black-hole solutions to the equations of motion of thestring-loop-corrected effective action. At the string-tree level, thesesolutions provide backgrounds for the "chiral null model". The effective actioncontains gravity, dilaton and moduli fields. Analytic solutions of theone-loop-corrected equations of motion are presented for the extremal magneticand dyonic black holes. Using the fact that in magnetic solution theloop-corrected dilaton is non-singular at the origin, we apply thecorrespondence principle to show that the entropy of the loop-correctedmagnetic black hole can be interpreted as the microscopic entropy of theD-brane system.
