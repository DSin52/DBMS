Title: Non-locally Regularized Field-Antifield Quantization of the Chiral

Schwinger ModelComments: 15 pages, Latex. Reference added

The non-local regularization is a powerfull method to regularize theorieswith an action that can be decomposed in a kinetic and an interacting part.Recently it was shown how to regularize the Batalin-Vilkovisky field-antifieldformalism of quantization of gauge theories with the non-local regularization.We compute precisely the anomaly of the Chiral Schwinger model with thisextended non-local regularization.
