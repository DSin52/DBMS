The combined effect of the magnetic field background in the form of asingular vortex and the Dirichlet boundary condition at the location of thevortex on the vacuum of quantized scalar field is studied. We find the inducedvacuum energy density and current to be periodic functions of the vortex fluxand holomorphic functions of the space dimension.
