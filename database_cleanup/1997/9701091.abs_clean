A universality of deformed Heisenberg algebra involving the reflectionoperator is revealed. It is shown that in addition to the well-knowninfinite-dimensional representations related to parabosons, the algebra hasalso finite-dimensional representations of the parafermionic nature. Wedemonstrate that finite-dimensional representations are representations ofdeformed parafermionic algebra with internal Z_2-grading structure. On theother hand, any finite- or infinite-dimensional representation of the algebrasupply us with irreducible representation of osp(1|2) superalgebra. We showthat the normalized form of deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection has thestructure of guon algebra related to the generalized statistics.
