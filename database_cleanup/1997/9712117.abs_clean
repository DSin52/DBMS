We study the (2,0) superconformal theories in six dimensions, which arisefrom the low-energy limit of k coincident 5-branes, using their discretelight-cone formulation as a superconformal quantum mechanical sigma model. Weanalyze the realization of the superconformal symmetry in the quantummechanics, and the realization of primary operators. As an example we computethe spectrum of chiral primary states in symmetric Spin(5)_R representations.To facilitate the analysis we introduce and briefly discuss a new class ofLorentz non-invariant theories, which flow in the IR to the (2,0)superconformal field theories but differ from them in the UV.
