This paper reviews recent work on a new geometric object called a bundlegerbe and discusses some new examples arising in quantum field theory. Oneapplication is to an Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theory construction of thebundle of fermionic Fock spaces parametrized by vector potentials in odd spacedimensions and a proof that this leads in a simple manner to the knownSchwinger terms (Mickelsson-Faddeev cocycle) for the gauge group action. Thisgives an explicit computation of the Dixmier-Douady class of the associatedbundle gerbe. The method works also in other cases of fermions in externalfields (external gravitational field, for example) provided that the APStheorem can be applied; however, we have worked out the details only in thecase of vector potentials. Another example, in which the bundle gerbe curvatureplays a role, arises from the WZW model on Riemann surfaces. A further exampleis the `existence of string structures' question. We conclude by showing howglobal Hamiltonian anomalies fit within this framework.
