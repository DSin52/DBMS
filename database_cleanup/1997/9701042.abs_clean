We present a general rule determining how extremal branes can interesect in aconfiguration with zero binding energy. The rule is derived in a modelindependent way and in arbitrary spacetime dimensions $D$ by solving theequations of motion of gravity coupled to a dilaton and several different$n$-form field strengths. The intersection rules are all compatible withsupersymmetry, although derived without using it. We then specialize to thebranes occurring in type II string theories and in M-theory. We show that theintersection rules are consistent with the picture that open branes can haveboundaries on some other branes. In particular, all the D-branes of dimension$q$, with $1\leq q \leq6$, can have boundaries on the solitonic 5-brane.
