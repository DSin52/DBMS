We consider vacuum tunneling of a new kind where the false vacua are nottranslationally invariant, but have topological defects that break some oftheir translational symmetries. In the particular case where the topologicaldefects are cosmic strings, we show the existence of an O(2) \times O(2)symmetric bounce configuration that allows a semi-classical estimate of therate of cosmic string induced tunneling. A method of reduction is thensuggested for simplifying the computation of the bounce action. Somephenomenological applications are described.
