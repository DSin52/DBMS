I review findings of various research groups regarding perturbative heteroticstring model building in the last 12 months. Attention is given to recentstudies of extra U(1)'s and local discrete symmetries (LDS's) in generic stringmodels. Issues covered include the role of U(1)'s and LDS's in limiting protondecay, developments in classification of models containing anomalous U(1), andpossible complications resulting from kinetic mixing between observable andhidden sector U(1)'s. Additionally, recent string-derived and string-inspiredmodels are briefly reviewed.Talk Presented at SUSY '97.
