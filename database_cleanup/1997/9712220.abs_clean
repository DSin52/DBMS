We derive the fermionic polynomial generalizations of the characters of theintegrable perturbations $\phi_{2,1}$ and $\phi_{1,5}$ of the general minimal$M(p,p')$ conformal field theory by use of the recently discovered trinomialanalogue of Bailey's lemma. For $\phi_{2,1}$ perturbations results are givenfor all models with $2p>p'$ and for $\phi_{1,5}$ perturbations results for allmodels with ${p'\over 3}<p< {p'\over 2}$ are obtained. For the $\phi_{2,1}$perturbation of the unitary case $M(p,p+1)$ we use the incidence matrixobtained from these character polynomials to conjecture a set of TBA equations.We also find that for $\phi_{1,5}$ with $2<p'/p < 5/2$ and for $\phi_{2,1}$satisfying $3p<2p'$ there are usually several different fermionic polynomialswhich lead to the identical bosonic polynomial. We interpret this to mean thatin these cases the specification of the perturbing field is not sufficient todefine the theory and that an independent statement of the choice of the propervacuum must be made.
