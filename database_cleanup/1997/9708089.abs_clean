The moduli space of 0-branes on $T^4$ gives a prediction for the moduli spaceof torons in U(n) Super Yang Mills theory which preserve 16 supersymmetries.The zero brane number corresponds to the greatest common denominator of therank $n$, magnetic fluxes and the instanton number. This prediction is derivedusing U-duality. We explicitly check this prediction by analyzing U(n) bundleswith non-zero first as well as second Chern classes. The argument is extendedto deduce the moduli space of torons which preserve 8 supersymmetries. Parts ofthe discussion extend naturally to $T^2$ and $T^3$. Some of the U-dualitiesinvolved are related to Lorentz boosts along the eleventh direction in Mtheory.
