Instantons and their quantisation in pure Yang-Mills theory formulated in thebackground of de Sitter spacetime represented by spatially-closed ($k = 1$)Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric are discussed. As for the classical treatmentof the instanton physics, first, explicit instanton solutions are found andnext, quantities like Pontryagin index and the semiclassical approximation tothe inter-vacua tunnelling amplitude are evaluated. The Atiyah-Patodi-Singerindex theorem is checked as well by constructing explicitly the normalizablefermion zero modes in this de Sitter spacetime instanton background. Finally,following the kink quantisation scheme originally proposed by Dashen,Hasslacher and Neveu, the quantisation of our instanton is performed. Ofparticular interest is the estimate of the lowest quantum correction to theinter-vacua tunnelling amplitude arising from the quantisation of theinstanton. It turns out that the inter-vacua tunnelling amplitude gets enhancedupon quantising the instanton.
