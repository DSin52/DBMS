APCTP-ICTP Joint International Conference '97 on 'Recent Developments inNonperturbative Quantum Field Theory', May 26-30, 1997, Seoul, Some typoscorrected, ReVTeX, 12 Pages, No FigureWe present a nonperturbative field theoretic method based on theLiouville-Neumann (LN) equation. The LN approach provides a unified formulationof nonperturbative quantum fields and also nonequilibrium quantum fields, whichmakes use of mean-field type equations and whose results at the lowest levelare identically the same as those of the Gaussian effective potential approachand the mean-field approach. The great advantageous point of this formulationis its readiness of applicability to time-dependent quantum systems and tofinite temperature field theory, and its possibility to go beyond the Gaussianapproximation.
