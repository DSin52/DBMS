In this paper we study isotropic integrable systems based on the braid-monoidalgebra. These systems constitute a large family of rational multistate vertexmodels and are realized in terms of the B_n, C_n and D_n Lie algebra and by thesuperalgebra Osp(n|2m). We present a unified formulation of the quantum inversescattering method for many of these lattice models. The appropriate fundamentalcommutation rules are found, allowing us to construct the eigenvectors and theeigenvalues of the transfer matrix associated to the B_n, C_n, D_n,Osp(2n-1|2), Osp(2|2n-2), Osp(2n-2|2) and Osp(1|2n) models. The correspondingBethe Ansatz equations can be formulated in terms of the root structure of theunderlying algebra.
