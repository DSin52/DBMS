We study de Wit-Hoppe-Nicolai supermembrane with emphasis on the winding inM-direction. We propose a SUSY algebra of the supermembrane in the Lorentzinvariant form. We analyze the BPS conditions and argue that the areapreserving diffeomorphism constraints associated with the harmonic vectorfields play an essential role. We derive the first order partial differentialequation that describes the BPS state with one quarter SUSY.
