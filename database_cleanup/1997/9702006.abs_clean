Duality between the E_8 x E_8 heterotic string and Type I' theory predicts atower of D(irichlet)-particle bound states corresponding to perturbativeheterotic string states. In the limit of infinite Type I' coupling, some ofthese bound states become massless, giving rise to enhanced E_8 x E_8 gaugesymmetry. By taking a different infinite coupling limit, one can recover theE_8 x E_8 gauge bosons of M-theory, compactified on S^1/Z_2. In this paper weuse the matrix model description of the D-particle dynamics to study thesebound states. We find results consistent with the chain of dualities andclarify a number of issues that arise in the application of the matrixmechanics to this system.
