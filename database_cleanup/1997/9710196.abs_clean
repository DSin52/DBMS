Title: Gravitational SD Perturbiner

Authors: A.Rosly, K.Selivanov

Comments: 4 pages, Latex

We present here an explicit self-dual classical solution of the type ofperturbiner in gravity. This solution is a generating function for treegravitational form-factors with all on-shell gravitons in the same helicitystate.
