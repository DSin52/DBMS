Title: Duality and Topological Quantum Field Theory

Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and M. Marino

Comments: 18 pages, latex. Invited talk at the 'Workshop on Frontiers of Field

Theory, Quantum Gravity and String Theory' held at Puri, India, on December12-21, 1996We present a summary of the applications of duality to Donaldson-Wittentheory and its generalizations. Special emphasis is made on the computation ofDonaldson invariants in terms of Seiberg-Witten invariants using recent resultsin N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory. A brief account on the invariants obtainedin the theory of non-abelian monopoles is also presented.
