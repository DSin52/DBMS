Within a BRST formulation, we determine the expressions of the consistentanomaly for superstrings with extended worldsheet supersymmetries of rank N. Weconsider the O(N) superconformal algebras up to N=4, as well as the `small N=4'superalgebra. This is done using a superfield formalism, allowing to recoverprevious results that were expressed in components. Moreover, we identify the`small N=4' algebra as the constrained `large N=4' via a self-duality likecondition in superspace.
