Title: A Comment on a Fivebrane Term in Superalgebra

Comments: 5 pages, TeX

We review our recent discussion of fivebrane central terms that appear in thespace-time superalgebra in D=10 provided that the space-time superchargesare taken in non-canonical pictures. We correct the mistake contained in theoriginal version of the earlier paper hep-th/9703008 which suggested that thenaive picture-changing of the superalgebra could give rise to thenon-perturbative five-form term. The relation between picture-changing andp-brane central terms appears to be much more subtle, as is pointed out in therevised version of the mentioned paper.
