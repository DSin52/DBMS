Title: Intersection Rules and Open Branes

Authors: R. Argurio

Comments: 12 pages, Latex, uses crckapb.sty. To appear in the proceedings of

the Cargese '97 summer schoolA general rule determining how extremal branes can intersect in aconfiguration with zero binding energy is presented. It is derived in a modelindependent way and without explicit use of supersymmetry, solving a set ofclassical equations of motion. When specializing to M and type II theories, itis shown that some intersection rules can be consistently interpreted asboundary rules for open branes ending on other branes.
