We develop here a simple formalism that converts the second-class constraintsinto first-class ones for a particle moving on the $n$-dimensional sphere. ThePoisson algebra generated by the Hamiltonian and the constraints closes and byquantization transforms into a Lie algebra. The observable of the theory isgiven by the Casimir operator of this algebra and coincides with the square ofthe angular momentum.
