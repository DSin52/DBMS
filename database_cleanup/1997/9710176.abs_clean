We analyse the structure of the perturbative series expansion of Chern-Simonsgauge theory in the light-cone gauge. After introducing a regularizationprescription that entails the consideration of framed knots, we present thegeneral form of the vacuum expectation value of a Wilson loop. The resultingexpression turns out to give the same framing dependence as the one obtainedusing non-perturbative methods and perturbative methods in covariant gauges. Italso contains the Kontsevich integral for Vassiliev invariants of framed knots.
