The connection between the anomalous dimension and some invariance propertiesof the fixed point actions within exact RG is explored. As an application,Polchinski equation at next-to-leading order in the derivative expansion isstudied. For the Wilson fixed point of the one-component scalar theory in threedimensions we obtain the critical exponents \eta=0.042, \nu=0.622 and\omega=0.754.
