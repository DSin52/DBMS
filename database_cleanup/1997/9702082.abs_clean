Authors: Yu. Kubyshin

Comments: 15 pages, 2 Postscript figures, Latex, uses sprocl.sty which is

included; contribution to the Proceedings of the Meeting "RenormalizationGroup - 96" (August 26 - 31, 1996, Dubna, Russia); misprints are corrected,some minor changes are made and one reference is added in the revised versionJournal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys. B12 (1998) 1321-1341

The Polchinski version of the exact renormalization group equation isdiscussed and its applications in scalar and fermionic theories are reviewed.Relation between this approach and the standard renormalization group isstudied, in particular the relation between the derivative expansion and theperturbation theory expansion is worked out in some detail.
