Both the supersymmetric $SO(32)$ and $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic strings in tendimensions have known strong-coupling duals. However, it has not been knownwhether there also exist strong-coupling duals for the non-supersymmetricheterotic strings in ten dimensions. In this paper, we construct explicitopen-string duals for the circle-compactifications of several of thesenon-supersymmetric theories, among them the tachyon-free $SO(16)\times SO(16)$string. Our method involves the construction of heterotic and open-stringinterpolating models that continuously connect non-supersymmetric strings tosupersymmetric strings. We find that our non-supersymmetric dual theories haveexactly the same massless spectra as their heterotic counterparts within acertain range of our interpolations. We also develop a novel method foranalyzing the solitons of non-supersymmetric open-string theories, and findthat the solitons of our dual theories also agree with their heteroticcounterparts. These are therefore the first known examples of strong/weakcoupling duality relations between non-supersymmetric, tachyon-free stringtheories. Finally, the existence of these strong-coupling duals allows us toexamine the non-perturbative stability of these strings, and we propose a phasediagram for the behavior of these strings as a function of coupling and radius.
