Starting with configurations of fourbranes, fivebranes, sixbranes andorientifolds in Type IIA string theory we derive via M-theory the curvessolving N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with gauge groups SO(N) and Sp(2N).We also obtain new curves describing theories with product gauge groups. Acrucial role in the discussion is played by the interaction of the orientifoldswith the NS-fivebranes.
