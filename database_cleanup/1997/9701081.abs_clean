It is known that the spin structure on a Riemannian manifold can be extendedto noncommutative geometry using the notion of a spectral triple. For finitegeometries, the corresponding finite spectral triples are completely describedin terms of matrices and classified using diagrams. When tensorized with theordinary space-time geometry, finite spectral triples give rise to Yang-Millstheories with spontaneous symmetry breaking, whose characteristic features aregauge multiplets of chiral fermions and links to Yukawa couplings.
