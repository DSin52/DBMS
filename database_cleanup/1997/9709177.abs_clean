We compare gap equation predictions for the spontaneous breaking of globalsymmetries in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to nonperturbative results fromholomorphic effective action techniques. In the theory without matter fields,both approaches describe the formation of a gluino condensate. With $N_f$flavors of quark and squark fields, and with $N_f$ below a certain criticalvalue, the coupled gap equations have a solution for quark and gluinocondensate formation, corresponding to breaking of global symmetries and ofsupersymmetry. This appears to disagree with the newer nonperturbativetechniques, but the reliability of gap equations in this context and whetherthe solution represents the ground state remain unclear.
