We have constructed the N=1/2 supersymmetric general Abelian model withasymmetric chiral couplings. This leads to a N=1/2 supersymmetrization ofthe Schwinger model. We show that the supersymmetric general model is plaguedwith problems of infrared divergence. Only the supersymmetric chiral Schwingermodel is free from such problems and is dynamically equivalent to the chiralSchwinger model because of the peculiar structure of the N=1/2 multiplets.
