The potential between two D4-branes at angles with partially unbrokensupersymmetry is computed, and is used to discuss the creation of a fundamentalstring when two such D4-branes cross each other in M(atrix) theory. Theeffective Lagrangian is shown to be anomalous at 1-loop approximation, but itcan be modified by bare Chern-Simons terms to preserve the invariance under thelarge gauge transformation. The resulting effective potential agrees with thatobtained from the string calculations. The result shows that a fundamentalstring is created in order to cancel the repulsive force between two D4-branesat proper angles.
