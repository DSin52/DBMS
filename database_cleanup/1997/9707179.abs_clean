We study the spectrum of BPS states in N=4 supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Millstheory. This theory has been proposed to describe M-theory on T^3 in thediscrete light-cone formalism. We find that the degeneracy of irreducible BPSbound states in this model exhibits a (partially hidden) SL(5,Z) dualitysymmetry. Besides the electro-magnetic symmetry, this duality group alsocontains Nahm-like transformations that interchange the rank N of the gaugegroup with some of the magnetic or electric fluxes. In the M-theoryinterpretation, this mapping amounts to a reflection that interchanges thelongitudinal direction with one of the transverse directions.
