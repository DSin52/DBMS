In the absence of a complete M-theory, we gather certain quantum aspects ofthis theory, namely, M-2 and M-5 brane duality and their tension quantizationrule $2\kappa^2 T_2 T_5 = 2 \pi n$, the M-2 brane tension quantization $T_2=\bigg({(2\pi)^2/2\kappa^2 m}\bigg)^{1/3}$, supersymmetry, perturbative gaugeand gravitational anomaly cancellations, and the half-integral quantization of(1) The complete determination of Ho\u{r}ava-Witten's$\eta = \lambda^6 /\kappa^4$ for M-theory on $R^{10} \times S^1/ Z_2$ requiresnot only the cancellation of M-theory gauge anomaly but also that of thegravitational anomaly, the quantization of M-2 brane tension, and the recentlyrecognized half-integral quantization of $[G^W / 2 \pi]$. (2) A well-definedquantum M-theory necessarily requires the presence of both M-2 and M-5 branesand allows only $n = 1$ and $m =1$ for the respectively quantized M-2 and M-5brane tensions. Implications of the above along with other related issues arediscussed.
