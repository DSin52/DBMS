We use path-integral methods to analyze the vacuum properties of a recentlyproposed extension of the Thirring model in which the interaction betweenfermionic currents is non-local. We calculate the exact ground state wavefunctional of the model for any bilocal potential, and also study itslong-distance behavior. We show that the ground state wave functional has ageneral factored Jastrow form. We also find that it posess an interestingsymmetry involving the interchange of density-density and current-currentinteractions.
