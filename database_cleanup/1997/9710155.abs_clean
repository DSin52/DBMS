Intersecting p-branes can be viewed as higher-dimensional interpretations ofmulti-charge extremal p-branes, where some of the individual p-branes undergodiagonal dimensional oxidation, while the others oxidise vertically. Althoughthe naive vertical oxidation of a single p-brane gives a continuum of p-branes,a more natural description arises if one considers a periodic array of p-branesin the higher dimension, implying a dependence on the compactificationcoordinates. This still reduces to the single lower-dimensional p-brane whenviewed at distances large compared with the period. Applying the same logic tothe multi-charge solutions, we are led to consider more general classes ofintersecting p-brane solutions, again depending on the compactificationcoordinates, which turn out to be described by interacting functions ratherthan independent harmonic functions. These new solutions also provide a moresatisfactory interpretation for the lower-dimensional multi-charge p-branes,which otherwise appear to be nothing more than the improbable coincidence ofcharge-centres of individual constituents with zero binding energy.
