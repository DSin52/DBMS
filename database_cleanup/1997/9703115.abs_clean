We study our Schwinger-Dyson equation as well as the large $N_{c}$ loopequation for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions by the N=1superspace Wilson-loop variable. We are successful in deriving a new manifestlysupersymmetric form in which a loop splitting and joining are represented by amanifestly supersymmetric as well as supergauge invariant operation insuperspace. This is found to be a natural extension from the abelian case. Wesolve the equation to leading order in perturbation theory or equivalently inthe linearized approximation, obtaining a desirable nontrivial answer. Thesuper Wilson-loop variable can be represented as the system of one-dimensionalfermion along the loop coupled minimally to the original theory. One-looprenormalization of the one-point Wilson-loop average is explicitly carried out,exploiting this property. The picture of string dynamics obtained is brieflydiscussed.
