Title: The Geometry of Supersymmetric Gauge Theories in Four Dimensions

Comments: Ph. D. Thesis, Latex file, 150 pages

GeometryWe review the relations between (twisted) supersymmetric gauge theories infour dimensions and moduli problems in four-dimensional topology, and we studyin detail the non-abelian monopole equations from this point of view. Therelevance of exact results in N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories to thecomputation of topological invariants is emphasized. Some background materialis provided, including an introduction to Donaldson theory, the twistingprocedure and the Mathai-Quillen formalism.
