Title: Possible quantum obstructions to the process of Abelian conversion

Authors: Ricardo Amorim and Ronaldo Thibes

Comments: 15 pages, Latex

The procedure for Abelian conversion of second class constraints due toBatalin, Fradkin, Fradkina and Tyutin is considered at quantum level, by usingthe field-antifield formalism. It is argued that quantum effects can obstructthe process. In this case, Wess-Zumino fields may be introduced in order torestore the lost symmetries.
