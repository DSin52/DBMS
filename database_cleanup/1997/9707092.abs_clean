In a solvable model of two dimensional SU(N) (N \to \infty) gauge fieldsinteracting with matter in both adjoint and fundamental representations weinvestigate the nature of the phase transition separating the strong and weakcoupling regions of the phase diagram. By interpreting the large N solution ofthe model in terms of SU(N) representations it is shown that the strongcoupling phase corresponds to a region where a gap occurs in the spectrum ofirreducible representations. We identify a gauge invariant order parameter forthe generalized confinement-deconfinement transition and give a physicalmeaning to each phase in terms of the interaction of a pair of test charges.
