A universal minimal spinor set of linear differential equations describinganyons and ordinary integer and half-integer spin fields is constructed withthe help of deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection. The construction isgeneralized to some d=2+1 supersymmetric field systems. Quadratic and linearforms of action functionals are found for the universal minimal as well as forsupersymmetric spinor sets of equations. A possibility of constructing auniversal classical mechanical model for d=2+1 spin systems is discussed.
