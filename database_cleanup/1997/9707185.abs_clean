We present a reformulation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in the maximal Abeliangauge, where the non-Abelian gauge field components are exactly integrated outat the expense of a new Abelian tensor field. The latter can be treated in asemiclassical approximation and the corresponding saddle point equation isderived. Besides the non-trivial solutions, which are presumably related tonon-perturbative interactions for the Abelian gauge field, the equation ofmotion for the tensor fields allows for a trivial solution as well. We showthat the semiclassical expansion around this trivial solution is equivalent tothe standard perturbation theory. In particular, we calculate the one-loop$\beta$-function for the running coupling constant in this approach andreproduce the standard result.
