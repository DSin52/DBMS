In this technical note we describe a pair of results on heteroticcompactifications. First, we give an example demonstrating that the usualstatement of the anomaly-freedom constraint for perturbative heteroticcompactifications (meaning, matching second Chern characters) is incorrect forcompactifications involving torsion-free sheaves. Secondly, we correct errorsin the literature regarding the counting of massless particles in heteroticcompactifications.
