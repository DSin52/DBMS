Title: BPS Monopoles and Electromagnetic Duality

Comments: 18 pages, Latex, Three figures, To appear in the Proceedings of the

Inaugration Conference of APCTP, Seoul Korea (1996)We review our recent work on the BPS magnetic monopoles and its relation tothe electromagnetic duality in the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills systems withan arbitrary gauge group. The gauge group can be maximally or partially broken.The low energy dynamics of the massive and massless magnetic monopoles areapproximated by the moduli space metric. We emphasize the possible connectionbetween the nature of the monopole moduli space with unbroken gauge group andthe physics of mesons and baryons in QCD.
