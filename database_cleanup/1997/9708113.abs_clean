We propose a toy model to illustrate how the effective Lagrangian for superQCD might go over to the one for ordinary QCD by a mechanism whereby thegluinos and squarks in the fundamental theory decouple below a givensupersymmetry breaking scale $m$. The implementation of this approach involvesa suitable choice of possible supersymmetry breaking terms. An amusing featureof the model is the emergence of the ordinary QCD degrees of freedom which werehidden in the auxiliary fields of the supersymmetric effective Lagrangian.
