We demonstrate linear stability of the dilatonic Black Holes appearing in astring-inspired higher-derivative gravity theory with a Gauss- Bonnetcurvature-squared term. The proof is accomplished by mapping the system to aone-dimensional Schrodinger problem which admits no bound states. This resultis important in that it constitutes a linearly stable example of a black holethat bypasses the `no-hair conjecture'. However, the dilaton hair is`secondary'in the sense that it is not accompanied by any new quantum numberfor the black hole solution.
