We consider axion-free quantum corrected black hole solutions in the contextof the heterotic S-T model with half the N=2, D=4 supersymmetries unbroken. Weexpress the perturbatively corrected entropy in terms of the electric andmagnetic charges in such a way, that target-space duality invariance ismanifest. We also discuss the microscopic origin of particular quantum blackhole configurations. We propose a microscopic interpretation in terms of a gasof closed membranes for the instanton corrections to the entropy.
