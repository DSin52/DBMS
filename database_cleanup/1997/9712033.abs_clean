The most general solution to the form factor problem in the sinh-Gordon modelis presented in an explicit way. The linearly independent classes of solutionscorrespond to powers of the elementary field. We show how the form factors ofexponential operators can be obtained from the general solution by adjustingfree parameters. The general formula obtained in the sinh-Gordon casereproduces the form factors of the scaling Lee-Yang model in a certain limit ofthe coupling constant.
