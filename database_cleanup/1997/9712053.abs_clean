We quantize the spontaneously broken abelian U(1) Higgs model by using theimproved BFT and BFV formalisms. We have constructed the BFT physical fields,and obtain the first class observables including the Hamiltonian in terms ofthese fields. We have also explicitly shown that there are exact forminvariances between the second class and first class quantities. Then,according to the BFV formalism, we have derived the corresponding Lagrangianhaving U(1) gauge symmetry. We also discuss at the classical level how oneeasily gets the first class Lagrangian from the symmetry-broken second classLagrangian.
