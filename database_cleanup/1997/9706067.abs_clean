Vinet (Springer-Verlag, New York, 2000) pp. 411-420The three-particle Hamiltonian obtained by replacing the two-bodytrigonometric potential of the Sutherland problem by a three-body one of asimilar form is shown to be exactly solvable. When written in appropriatevariables, its eigenfunctions can be expressed in terms of Jack symmetricpolynomials. The exact solvability of the problem is explained by a hidden$sl(3,R)$ symmetry. A generalized Sutherland three-particle problem includingboth two- and three-body trigonometric potentials and internal degrees offreedom is then considered. It is analyzed in terms of three first-ordernoncommuting differential-difference operators, which are constructed bycombining SUSYQM supercharges with the elements of the dihedral group~$D_6$.Three alternative commuting operators are also introduced.
