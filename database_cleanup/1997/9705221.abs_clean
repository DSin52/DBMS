We present four infinite series of new quantum theories with super-Poincaresymmetry in six dimensions, which are not local quantum field theories. Theyhave string like excitations but the string coupling is of order one.Compactifying these theories on $T^5$ we find a Matrix theory description of Mtheory on $T^5$ and on $T^5/\IZ_2$, which is well defined and is manifestlyU-duality invariant.
