We consider in more detail the role of D0-branes as instantons in theconstruction of SU(N) Super Yang-Mills and Super QCD theories in fourspace-time dimensions with D4, D6 and NS-branes. In particular, we show how theD0-branes describe both the exact and constrained instantons and reproduce thecorrect pattern of lifting of zero modes on the various branches of thesemodels.
