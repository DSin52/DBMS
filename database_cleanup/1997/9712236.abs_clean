Recently, in collaboration with Susskind, we proposed a model ofSchwarzschild black holes in Matrix theory. A large Schwarzschild black hole isdescribed by a metastable bound state of a large number of D0-branes which areheld together by a background, whose structure has so far been understood onlyin 8 and 11 dimensions. The Hawking radiation proceeds by emission of smallclusters of D0-branes. We estimate the Hawking rate in the Matrix theory modelof Schwarzschild black holes and find agreement with the semiclassical rate upto an undetermined numerical coefficient of order 1.
