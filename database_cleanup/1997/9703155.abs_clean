Title: Black Hole Radiance and Supersymmetry

Comments: 9 pages, Revtex, no figures

Starting with free massless scalar and spinor fields described by a globallyN=1 supersymmetric action, infalling on a Schwarzschild black hole, theoutgoing Hawking radiation is shown to break supersymmetry spontaneously,exactly as induced by a heat bath in Minkowski space, with no generation ofNambu-Goldstone fermions.
