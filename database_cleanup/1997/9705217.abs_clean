In this work we consider an Abelian O(3) sigma model coupled nonminimallywith a gauge field governed by a Maxwell and Chern-Simons terms. Bogomol'nyiequations are constructed for a specific form of the potential and genericnonminimal coupling constant. Furthermore, topological and nontopologicalself-dual soliton solutions are obtained for a critical value of the nonminimalcoupling constant. Some particular static vortex solutions (topological andnontopological) satisfying the Bogomol'nyi bound are numerically solved andpresented.
