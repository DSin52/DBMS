Title: The Self-Dual String Soliton

Authors: P.S. Howe, N.D. Lambert and P.C. West

Comments: 21 pages phyzzx. The discussion of the supersymmetry transformations

and the fivebrane equations of motion has been significantly extended. Somereferences have been added. The results are the same as the previous versionJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B515 (1998) 203-216

We obtain a BPS soliton of the M theory fivebrane's equations of motionrepresenting a supersymmetric self-dual string. The resulting solution is thendimensionally reduced and used to obtain 0-brane and (p-2)-brane solitons onD-p-branes.
