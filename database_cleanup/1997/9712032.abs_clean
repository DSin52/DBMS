We present a continuum formulation for $\theta$-vacua in the massiveSchwinger model on the light-front, where $\theta$ enters as a backgroundelectric field. The effective coupling of the external field is partiallyscreened due to vacuum polarization processes. For small fermion masses andsmall $\theta$ we calculate the mass of the meson and find agreement withresults from bosonization.
