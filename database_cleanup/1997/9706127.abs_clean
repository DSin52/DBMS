We use the M theory approach of Witten to investigate N=1 SU($N_c$) SQCD with$N_f$ flavors. We reproduce the field theoretical results and identify in Mtheory the gluino condensate and the eigenvalues of the meson matrix. Thisapproach allows us to identify the constant piece of the effective field theorycoupling from which the coefficient of the one-loop $\beta$-function can beidentified. By studying the area of the M-theory five-brane we investigate thestability of type IIA brane configurations. We prove that in a supersymmetricsetup there is no force between static D4-branes that end on NS five-branes.The force in the case that there is a relative velocity between the branes iscomputed. We show that at the regions of intersecting IIA branes the curvatureof the M theory five-brane is singular in the type IIA limit.
