We study a model of free massless scalar fields on a two dimensional cylinderwith metric that admits a change of signature between Lorentzian and Euclideantype (ET), across the two timelike hypersurfaces (with respect to Lorentzianregion). Considering a long strip-shaped region of the cylinder, denoted by anangle \theta, as the signature changed region it is shown that the energyspectrum depends on the angle \theta and in a sense differs from ordinary onefor low energies. Morever diffeomorphism algebra of corresponding infiniteconserved charges is different from '' Virasoro'' algebra and approaches to itat higher energies. The central term is also modified but does not approach tothe ordinary one at higher energies.
