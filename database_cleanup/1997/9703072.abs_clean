We present a general analysis of all the possible soft breakings of N=2supersymmetric QCD, preserving the analytic properties of the Seiberg-Wittensolutions for the SU(2) group with Nf=1, 2, 3 hypermultiplets. We obtain allthe couplings of the spurion fields in terms of properties of theSeiberg-Witten periods, which we express in terms of elementary ellipticfunctions by uniformizing the elliptic curves associated to each number offlavors. We analyze in detail the monodromy properties of the softly brokentheory, and obtain them by a particular embedding into a pure gauge theory withhigher rank group. This allows to write explicit expressions of the effectivepotential, which are close to the exact answer for moderate values of thesupersymmetry breaking parameters. The vacuum structures and phases of thebroken theories will be analyzed in the forthcoming second part of this paper.
