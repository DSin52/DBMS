In this paper free field realizations of affine current superalgebras areconsidered. Based on quantizing differential operator realizations of thecorresponding basic Lie superalgebras, general and simple expressions for boththe bosonic and the fermionic currents are provided. Screening currents of thefirst kind are also presented. Finally, explicit free field realizations ofprimary fields with general, possibly non-integer, weights are worked out. Aformalism is used where the (generally infinite) multiplet is replaced by agenerating function primary operator. The results allow setting up integralrepresentations for correlators of primary fields corresponding to integrablerepresentations. The results are generalizations to superalgebras of a recentwork on free field realizations of affine current algebras by Petersen, Yu andthe present author.
