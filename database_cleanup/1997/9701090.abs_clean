Title: Restrictions on Magnetic Charge from Quantized Angular Momentum

Comments: 9 pages ReVTeX

Using the result that an electric charge - magnetic charge system carries aninternal field angular momentum of $e g / 4 \pi$ we arrive at two restrictionson magnetic monopoles via the requirement of angular momentum quantizationand/or conservation. First we show that magnetic charge should scale in theopposite way from electric charge. Second we show that free, unconfinedmonopoles seem to be inconsistent when one considers a magnetic charge in thevicinity of more than one electric charge.
