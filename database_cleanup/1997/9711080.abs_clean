Recent developments involving strongly coupled superstrings are discussedfrom a phenomenological point of view. In particular, strongly coupled$E_8\times E'_8$ is described as an appropriate long-wavelength limit ofM-theory, and some generic phenomenological implications are analyzed,including a long sought downward shift of the string unification scale and anovel way to break supersymmetry. A specific scenario is presented that leadsto a rather light, and thus presently experimentally testable, sparticlespectrum.
