We study the nonrelativistic limit of the theory of a quantum Chern--Simonsfield minimally coupled to Dirac fermions. To get the nonrelativistic effectiveLagrangian one has to incorporate vacuum polarization and anomalous magneticmoment effects. Besides that, an unsuspected quartic fermionic interaction mayalso be induced. As a by product, the method we use to calculate loop diagrams,separating low and high loop momenta contributions, allows to identify how aquantum nonrelativistic theory nests in a relativistic one.
