For the gauge couplings, which arise after toroidal compactification ofsix-dimensional heterotic N=1 string theories from the T^2 torus, we calculatetheir one-loop corrections. This is performed by considering string amplitudesinvolving two gauge fields and moduli fields. We compare our results with theequations following from N=2 special geometry and the underlying prepotentialof the theory. Moreover we find relations between derivatives of the N=2, d=4prepotential and world-sheet tau-integrals which appear in various stringamplitudes of any T^2-compactification.
