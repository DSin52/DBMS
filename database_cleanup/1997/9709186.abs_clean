We investigate the phase structures of various N=1 supersymmetric gaugetheories including even the exceptional gauge group from the viewpoint ofsuperconvergence of the gauge field propagator. Especially we analyze in detailwhether a new type of duality recently discovered by Oehme in $SU(N_c)$ gaugetheory coupled to fundamental matter fields can be found in more general gaugetheories with more general matter representations or not. The result is that inthe cases of theories including matter fields in only the fundamentalrepresentation, Oehme's duality holds but otherwise it does not. In the formercase, superconvergence relation might give good criterion to describe theinteracting non-Abelian Coulomb phase without using some information from dualmagnetic theory.
