We study soliton solutions in 1+1 dimensional gauged sigma models, obtainedby dimensional reduction from its 2+1 dimensional counterparts. We show thatthe Bogomol'nyi bound of these models can be expressed in terms of twoconserved charges in a similar way to that of the BPS dyons in 3+1 dimensions.Purely magnetic vortices of the 2+1 dimensional completely gauged sigma modelappear as charged solitons in the corresponding 1+1 dimensional theory. Thescale invariance of these solitons is also broken because of the dimensionalreduction. We obtain exact static soliton solutions of these models saturatingthe Bogomol'nyi bound.
