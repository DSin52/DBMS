There are two different spectral flows on the N=2 superconformal algebras(four in the case of the Topological algebra). The usual spectral flow, firstconsidered by Schwimmer and Seiberg, is an even transformation, whereas thespectral flow previously considered by the author and Rosado is an oddtransformation. We show that the even spectral flow is generated by the oddspectral flow, and therefore only the latter is fundamental. We also analyzethoroughly the four ``topological'' spectral flows, writing two of them herefor the first time. Whereas the even and the odd spectral flows havequasi-mirrored properties acting on the Antiperiodic or the Periodic algebras,the topological even and odd spectral flows have drastically differentproperties acting on the Topological algebra. The other two topologicalspectral flows have mixed even and odd properties. We show that the even andthe even-odd topological spectral flows are generated by the odd and theodd-even topological spectral flows, and therefore only the latter arefundamental.
