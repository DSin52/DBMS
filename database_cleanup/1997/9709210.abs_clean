The degeneracy structure of the eigenspace of the N-particleCalogero-Sutherland model is studied from an algebraic point of view. Suitableoperators satisfying SU(2) algebras and acting on the degenerate eigenspace areexplicitly constructed for the two particle case and then appropriatelygeneralized to the N-particle model. The raising and lowering operators ofthese algebras connect the states, in a subset of the degenerate eigenspace,with each other.
