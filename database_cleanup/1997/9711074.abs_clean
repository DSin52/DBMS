We study N=1 four dimensional gluodynamics in the context of M-theorycompactifications on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds. Gauginocondensates, \theta-dependence, Witten index and domain walls are consideredfor singularities of type $\hat{A}_{n-1}$ and $\hat{D}_{n+4}$. It is shown howthe topology of intersections among the irreducible components defining thesingular elliptic fiber, determine the entanglement of vacua and the appareanceof domain walls.
