We show how to extend the standard functional approach to bosonisation, basedon a decoupling change of path-integral variables, to the case in which afinite temperature is considered. As examples, in order to both illustrate andcheck the procedure, we derive the thermodynamical partition functions for theThirring and Schwinger models.
