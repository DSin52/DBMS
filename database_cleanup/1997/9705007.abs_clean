The antifield formalism is extended so as to incorporate the rigid symmetriesof a given theory. To that end, it is necessary to introduce global ghosts notonly for the given rigid symmetries, but also for all the higher orderconservation laws, associated with conserved antisymmetric tensors. Otherwise,one may encounter obstructions of the type discussed in [13]. These higherorder conservation laws are shown to define additional rigid symmetries of themaster equation and to form -- together with the standard symmetries -- aninteresting algebraic structure. They lead furthermore to independent Wardidentities which are derived in the standard manner, because the resultingmaster ("Zinn-Justin") equation capturing both the gauge symmetries and therigid symmetries of all orders takes a known form. Issues such as anomalies orconsistent deformations of the action preserving some set of rigid symmetriescan be also systematically analysed in this framework.
