The N=1 supersymmetric gauge SU(5) theory with one antisymmetric tensor, n+3fundamentals and n+4 antifundamentals has dual magnetic descriptions in theinfrared. By introducing extra singlet fields and tree level superpotentialterms to the electric SU(5) theories, we are able to make the dual theoriesflow to the known SU(n)xSU(2) gauge theories which break supersymmetrydynamically. In the n=2 case, the lifting of the pseudo-flat direction isestimated by using dual operator mappings.
