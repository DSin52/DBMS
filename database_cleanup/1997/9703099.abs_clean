A generalization of the embedding approach for d-dimensional gravity basedupon p-brane theories is considered. We show that the D-dimensional p-branecoupled to an antisymmetric tensor field of rank (p+1) provides the dynamicalbasis for the description of d=(p+1) dimensional gravity in the isometricembedding formalism. ''Physical'' matter appears in such an approach as amanifestation of a D-dimensional antisymmetric tensor (generalized Kalb-Ramond) background. For the simplest case, the Lorentz harmonic formulation ofthe bosonic string in a Kalb-Ramond background and its relation to a firstorder Einstein-Cartan approach for d=2 dimensional gravity is analysed insome detail. A general Poisson-sigma-model structure emerges. For the minimalchoice of D=3 an interesting ``dual'' formulation is found which has thestructure of a Jackiw-Teitelboim theory, coupled minimally to a massive scalarfield. Our approach is intended to serve as a preparation for the study of d-dimensional supergravity theory, either starting from the generalized action offree supersymmetric (d-1)-branes or $D_{(d-1)}$-branes, or from thecorresponding geometric equations ('rheotropic' conditions).
