minor correctionsSince the lightcone self dual spherical membrane, moving in flat targetbackgrounds, has a direct correspondence with the SU(\infty) Nahm equations andthe continuous Toda theory, we construct the quantum/Moyal deformations of theself dual membrane in terms of the q-Moyal star product . The q deformations ofthe SU(\infty) Nahm equations are studied and explicit solutions are given. Thecontinuum limit of the q Toda chain equations are obtained furnishing qdeformations of the self dual membrane. Finally, the continuum Moyal-Toda chainequation is embedded into the SU(\infty) Moyal-Nahm equations, rendering therelation with the Moyal deformations of the self dual membrane. W_{\infty} andq-W_{\infty} algebras arise as the symmetry algebras and the role of ( therecently developed ) quantum Lie algebras associated with quantized universalenveloping algebras is pointed out pertaining the formulation of a q Todatheory. We review as well the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal quantization of the 3Dcontinuous Toda field equation, and its associated 2D continuous Toda molecule,based on Moyal deformations of rotational Killing symmetry reductions ofPlebanski first heavenly equation.
