We consider the scattering of two Dirichlet zero-branes in M(atrix) theory.Using the formulation of M(atrix) theory in terms of ten-dimensional superYang-Mills theory dimensionally reduced to $(0+1)$-dimensions, we obtain theeffective (velocity dependent) potential describing these particles. Atone-loop we obtain the well known result for the leading order of the effectivepotential $V_{eff}\sim v^4/r^7$, where $v$ and $r$ are the relative velocityand distance between the two zero-branes respectively. A calculation of theeffective potential at two-loops shows that no renormalizations of the$v^4$-term of the effective potential occur at this order.
