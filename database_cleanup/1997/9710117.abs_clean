We prove that the simple condition on the potential V, \int exp(-t V) <\infty for all t>0, is sufficient for the lattice approximation of the traceTr[A exp(-b H)] with (Re b)>0 to work for all bounded functions A and a largeclass of potentials. As a by-product we obtain an explicit bound for thereal-temperature lattice kernels.
