Recently, it was observed that self-interacting scalar quantum field theorieshaving a non-Hermitian interaction term of the form $g(i\phi)^{2+\delta}$,where $\delta$ is a real positive parameter, are physically acceptable in thesense that the energy spectrum is real and bounded below. Such theories possessPT invariance, but they are not symmetric under parity reflection or timereversal separately. This broken parity symmetry is manifested in a nonzerovalue for $<\phi>$, even if $\delta$ is an even integer. This paper extendsthis idea to a two-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theory whosesuperpotential is ${\cal S}(\phi)=-ig(i\phi)^{1+\delta}$. The resulting quantumfield theory exhibits a broken parity symmetry for all $\delta>0$. However,supersymmetry remains unbroken, which is verified by showing that theground-state energy density vanishes and that the fermion-boson mass ratio isunity.
