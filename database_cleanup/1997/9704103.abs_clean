We propose a method for the numerical computation of microcanonicalexpectation values--i.e. averages over energy eigenstates with the sameeigenvalue-without any prior knowledge about the spectrum of the Hamiltonian.This is accomplished by first defining a new Gaussian ensemble to approximatethe microcanonical one. We then develop a ``lattice theory'' for this Gaussianensemble and propose a Monte Carlo integration of the expectation values of thelattice theory.
