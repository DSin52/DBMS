XII Italian Conference on General Relativity and Gravitational Physics, Rome,September 1996Notwithstanding the central role of D-branes in many recently proposed stringdualities, several interesting type I vacua have been found without resortingdirectly to D-brane technology. In this talk, we analyze a three-generationSO(8)xU(12) chiral type I model with N=1 supersymmetry in D=4. It descends fromthe type IIB compactification on the Z orbifold and requires only Neumannboundary conditions, i.e. only the ubiquitous D9-branes (pan-branes). We alsodiscuss a large class of 6D type I vacua that display rich patterns ofChan-Paton symmetry breaking/enhancement and various numbers of tensormultiplets. Finally, we briefly address issues raised by the conjecturedheterotic - type I duality and by the relation between type I vacua andcompactifications of the putative F-theory.
