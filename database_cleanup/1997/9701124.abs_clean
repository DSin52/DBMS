Title: Basis Invariants in Non--Abelian Gauge Theories

Comments: 21 pages, 2 figures, 15 tables; LaTeX, uses epsfig; figure in Table 5

and typo in Table 8 correctedA basis of Lorentz and gauge-invariant monomials in non--Abelian gaugetheories with matter is described, applicable for the inverse mass expansion ofeffective actions. An algorithm to convert an arbitrarily given invariantexpression into a linear combination of the basis elements is presented. Thelinear independence of the basis invariants is proven.
