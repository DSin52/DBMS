field theoriesAuthors: Jean-Bernard Zuber

The aim of this lecture is to present the concept of C-algebra and totheir folding on the one hand, the structure of rational conformal fieldtheories on the other. For simplicity the discussion is restricted to finiteCoxeter groups and conformal theories with a $\hat{sl}(2)$ current algebra, butit may be extended to a larger class of groups and theories associated with$\hat{sl}(N)$.
