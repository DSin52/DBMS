These are notes of a seminar given at the 30th International Symposium on theTheory of Elementary Particles, Berlin-Buckow, August 1996. The material isderived from collaborations with E. Cremmer and J.-L. Gervais, and C. Klimcik,and is partially new. Within the general framework of Poisson-Lie symmetry, wediscuss two approaches to the problem of constructing moment maps, orq-deformed Noether charges, that generate the quantum group symmetry whichappears in many conformal field theories. Concretely, we consider the case of$U_q(sl(2))$ and the operator algebra that describes Liouville theory and othermodels built from integer powers of screenings in the Coulomb gas picture.
