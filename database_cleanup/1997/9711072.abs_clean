We calculate semiclassically the emission rate of spin 1/2 particles fromcharged, nonrotating black holes in D=5,N=8 supergravity. The relevant Diracequation is solved by the same approximation as in the bosonic case. Theresulting expression for the emission rate has a form which is predicted fromD-brane effective field theory.
