Title: Towards solving gauge-field theory

Comments: Latex, 12 pages, 4 figures

The canonical front form Hamiltonian for non-Abelian SU(N) gauge theory in3+1 dimensions is mapped non-perturbatively on an effective Hamiltonian whichacts only in the Fock space of a quark and an antiquark. The approach is basedon the novel method of iterated resolvents and on discretized light-conequantization, driven to the continuum limit. It is free of the usualTamm-Dancoff truncations of the Fock space, rather the perturbative series areconsistently resumed to all orders in the coupling constant. Emphasis is put ondealing with the many-body aspects of gauge field theory. The effectiveinteraction turns out to be the kernel of an integral equation in the momentumspace of a single quark, which is frame-independent and solvable oncomparatively small computers. Important is that the higher Fock-spaceamplitudes can be retrieved self-consistently from these solutions.
