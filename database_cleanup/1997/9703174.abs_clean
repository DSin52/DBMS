A Chern-Simons theory in 11 dimensions, which is a piece of the 11dimensional supergravity action, is considered as a quantum field theory in itsown right. We conjecture that it defines a non-perturbative phase of M theoryin which the metric and gravitino vanish. The theory is diffeomorphisminvariant but not topological in that there are local degrees of freedom.Nevertheless, there are a countable number of momentum variables associatedwith relative cobordism classes of embeddings of seven dimensional manifolds inten dimensional space. The canonical theory is developed in terms of an algebraof gauge invariant observables. We find a sector of the theory corresponding toa topological compactification in which the geometry of the compactifieddirections is coded in an algebra of functions on the base manifold. Thediffeomorphism invariant quantum theory associated to this sector isconstructed, and is found to describe diffeomorphism classes of excitations ofthree surfaces wrapping homology classes of the compactified dimensions.
