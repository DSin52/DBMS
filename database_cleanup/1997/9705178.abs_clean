We study the influence of the anomaly on the physical quantum picture of thegeneralized chiral Schwinger model defined on the circle. We show that theanomaly i) results in the background linearly rising electric field and ii)makes the spectrum of the physical Hamiltonian nonrelativistic without amassive boson. The physical matter fields acquire exotic statistics . Weconstruct explicitly the algebra of the Poincare generators and show that itdiffers from the Poincare one. We exhibit the role of the vacuum Berry phase inthe failure of the Poincare algebra to close. We prove that, in spite of thebackground electric field, such phenomenon as the total screening of externalcharges characteristic for the standard Schwinger model takes place in thegeneralized chiral Schwinger model, too.
