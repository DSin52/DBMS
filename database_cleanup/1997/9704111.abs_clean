We classify degeneration patterns of Verma modules over the N=2superconformal algebra in two dimensions. Explicit formulae are given forsingular vectors that generate maximal submodules in each of the degeneratecases. The mappings between Verma modules defined by these singular vectors areembeddings; in particular, their compositions never vanish. As a by-product, wealso obtain general formulae for N=2 subsingular vectors.
