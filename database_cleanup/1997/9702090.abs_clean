We describe how it is possible to introduce the interaction betweensuperconformal fields of the same conformal dimensions. In the classical casesuch construction can be used to the construction of the Hirota - Satsumaequation. We construct supersymmetric Poisson tensor for such fields, whichgenerates a new class of Hamiltonin systems. We found Lax representation forone of equation in this class by supersymmetrization Lax operator responsiblefor Hirota - Satsuma equation. Interestingly our supersymmetric equation is notreducible to classical Hirota - Satsuma equation. We show that our generalizedsystem is reduced to the one of the supersymmetric KDV equation (a=4) but inthis limit integrals of motion are not reduced to integrals of motion of thesupersymmetric KdV equation.
