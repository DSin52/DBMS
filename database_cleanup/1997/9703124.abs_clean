Title: Intersecting branes and Supersymmetry

Authors: M. de Roo

Comments: 6 pages, Latex, Presented at Supersymmetry and Quantum Field Theory,

International Seminar dedicated to the memory of D. V. Volkov, Kharkov, 1997We consider intersecting M-brane solutions of supergravity in elevendimensions. Supersymmetry turns out to be a powerful tool in obtaining suchsolutions and their generalizations.
