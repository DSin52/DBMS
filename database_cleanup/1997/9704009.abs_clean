Title: F-Theory and the universal string theory

Authors: JM Figueroa-O'Farrill

Comments: 11 pages

We apply the techniques of the ``universal string theory'' to the``manifold'' paradigm for superstring/M-theory and come up with a candidatetheoretical terms. It contains the five known superstring theories asparticular vacua; although the natural vacua are (10+2)-dimensional. As abyproduct, a natural explanation emerges for the compactness of the extra twocoordinates in F-theory.
