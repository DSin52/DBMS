We construct, for the first time, a model of graceful exit transition from adilaton-driven inflationary phase to a decelerated Friedman-Robertson-Walkerera. Exploiting a demonstration that classical corrections can stabilize a highcurvature string phase while the evolution is still in the weakly coupledregime, we show that if additional terms of the type that may result fromquantum corrections to the string effective action exist, and induce violationof the null energy condition, then evolution towards a deceleratedFriedman-Robertson-Walker phase is possible. We also observe that stabilizingthe dilaton at a fixed value, either by capture in a potential minimum or byradiation production, may require that these quantum corrections are turnedoff, perhaps by non-perturbative effects or higher order contributions whichoverturn the null energy condition violation.
