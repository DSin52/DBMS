The time development of a model of (2+1)-dimensional torus universe isstudied based on background field equations which follow from a string theory.The metrics in various cases are characterized by a real parameter whichspecifies a ratio of the lengths of two independent cycles. When the parameteris a rational number, the space is asymptotically stretched along a cycle whilethe other cycle kept finite. When the parameter is an irrational number, thelengths of two cycles, as well as the space volume (area), grow in proportionto the proper time $t$ for an observer sitting at rest in this universe in theasymptotic region.
