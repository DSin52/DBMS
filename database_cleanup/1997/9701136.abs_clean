It is shown that there is a precise sense in which the Heisenberg uncertaintybetween fluxes of electric and magnetic fields through finite surfaces is givenby (one-half $\hbar$ times) the Gauss linking number of the loops that boundthese surfaces. To regularize the relevant operators, one is naturally led toassign a framing to each loop. The uncertainty between the fluxes of electricand magnetic fields through a single surface is then given by the self-linkingnumber of the framed loop which bounds the surface.
