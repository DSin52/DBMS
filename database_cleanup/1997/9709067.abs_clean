We present a procedure of differential renormalization at the one loop levelwhich avoids introducing unnecessary renormalization constants andautomatically preserves abelian gauge invariance. The amplitudes are expressedin terms of a basis of singular functions. The local terms appearing in therenormalization of these functions are determined by requiring consistency withthe propagator equation. Previous results in abelian theories, with and withoutsupersymmetry, are discussed in this context.
