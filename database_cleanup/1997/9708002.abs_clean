We study some aspects of the strong coupling dynamics of Dirichlet sixbranes, anti- six branes, and orientifold planes by using the equivalence oftype IIA string theory and M-theory on S^1. In the strong coupling limit thereexists static configuration of brane and anti-brane at arbitrary separation,suspended in an external magnetic field. The mass of the open string stretchedbetween the brane and the anti-brane approaches a finite positive value evenwhen the branes coincide. Similar result is obtained for a Dirichlet six braneon top of an orientifold six plane. We also derive the anomalous gravitationalinteraction on the brane and the orientifold plane from M-theory.
