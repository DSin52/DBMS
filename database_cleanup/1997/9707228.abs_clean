We discuss the relation between supersymmetric gauge theory of branes andsupergravity; as it was discovered in D-brane physics, and as it appears inMatrix theory, with emphasis on motion in curved backgrounds. We argue thatgauged sigma model Lagrangians can be used as definitions of Matrix theory incurved space. Lecture given at Strings '97; June 20, 1997.
