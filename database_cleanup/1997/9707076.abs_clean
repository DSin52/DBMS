We suggest an alternative approach to deconfine N =1 SU(N) supersymmetricgauge theory with a symmetric tensor, fundamentals, anti-fundamentals, and nosuperpotential. It is found that although the dual prescription derived by thisnew method of deconfinement is different from that by the original method, bothdual prescriptions are connected by duality transformations. By deforming thetheory, it is shown that both dual theories flow properly so that the Seiberg'sduality is preserved.
