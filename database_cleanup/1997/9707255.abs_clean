Title: Burgers turbulence with pressure

Comments: 4 pages, revtex

The randomly driven Burgers equation with pressure is considered as a 1Dmodel of strong turbulence of compressible fluid. It is shown that infinitelysmall pressure provides a finite effect on the velocity and density statisticsand this case therefore is qualitatively different from turbulence withoutpressure. We establish the corresponding operator product expansion and predictthe intermittent velocity- difference and mass-difference PDFs. We then applythe developed methods to the statistics of a passive scalar advected by theBurgers field.
