Within the Local Potential Approximation to Wilson's, or Polchinski's, exactrenormalization group, and for general spacetime dimension, we construct afunction, c, of the coupling constants; it has the property that (for unitarytheories) it decreases monotonically along flows, and is stationary only atfixed points ---where it `counts degrees of freedom', i.e. is extensive,counting one for each Gaussian scalar. Furthermore, by choosing restrictions tosome sub-manifold of coupling constant space, we arrive at a very promisingvariational approximation method.
