We introduce a new concept of infinite quasi-exactly solvable models whichare constructable through multi-parameter deformations of known exactlysolvable ones. The spectral problem for these models admits exact solutions forinfinitely many eigenstates but not for the whole spectrum. The hermiticity oftheir hamiltonians is guaranteed by construction. The proposed models havequasi-exactly solvable classical conterparts.
