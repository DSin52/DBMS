We derive the low energy absorption cross section of minimal scalars for avery generic class of geometries, that includes, among others, black holes,strings, $p$-branes, as well as intersecting brane configurations. The scalarfield can be absorbed across a regular surface (a horizon) of finite area, oracross a zero area throat, which may be singular or regular. Then we focus onsome particular cases and compare with the results obtained using microscopicmodels at weak coupling. Exact agreement is found for the absorption by thenon-degenerate ground state of effective strings. For geometries where thethroat is singular, we show that absorption through the stretched horizonyields correct results for degenerate states. For non-degenerate (ground)states we introduce a stretched throat, and show that it accounts for thecorrect dependence on frequency, charges, and moduli for the absorption byground states of BPS fundamental strings. It is also shown to lead to thecorrect dependence on frequency for extremal D-branes.
