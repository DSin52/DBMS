Title: Topologically Massive Models from Higgs Mechanism

Authors: A. De Castro and A. Restuccia

Comments: 12 pages, latex, no figures

A new variational principle allowing the implementation of the Higgsmechanism for abelian theories over non-trivial background flat connections isproposed. It is found that the mass generated for the spin 1 excitation is thesame as the one obtained from the standard Higgs mechanism over trivialbackgrounds, however, the dynamical structure of the action for the Higgsscalar is completely different from the usual approach. There is a topologicalcontribution to the mass term of the Higgs field. After functional integrationover all backgrounds, it is shown that the action for the massive spin 1excitation is dual to the Topologically Massive Models in any dimension.
