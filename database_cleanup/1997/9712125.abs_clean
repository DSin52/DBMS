We analyse completely the BRST cohomology on local functionals for twodimensional sigma models coupled to abelian world sheet gauge fields, includingeffective bosonic D-string models described by Born-Infeld actions. Inparticular we prove that the rigid symmetries of such models are exhausted bythe solutions to generalized Killing vector equations which we have presentedrecently, and provide all the consistent first order deformations and candidategauge anomalies of the models under study. For appropriate target spacegeometries we find nontrivial deformations both of the abelian gaugetransformations and of the world sheet diffeomorphisms, and antifield dependentcandidate anomalies for both types of symmetries separately, as well as mixedones.
