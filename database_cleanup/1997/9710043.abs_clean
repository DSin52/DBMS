Comments: Latex file, 5 pages, 8 ps-figures & 1 style-file; written version of

a talk given at the QCD97 conference in Montpellier, FranceJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 64 (1998) 301-305

Using mass perturbation theory, we infer the bound-state spectrum of massiveQED$_2$ and compute some decay widths of unstable bound states. Further, wediscuss scattering processes, where all the resonances and particle productionthresholds are properly taken into account by our methods.
