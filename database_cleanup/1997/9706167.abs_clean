It is argued that, in the two dimensional principal chiral model, theWess-Zumino term can be induced quantum mechanically, allowing the model withthe critical value of the coupling constant $\lambda^2 = 8\pi/|k|$ toturn into the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model at the quantum level. TheWess-Zumino term emerges from the inequivalent quantizations possible on asphere hidden in the configuration space of the original model. It is shownthat the Dirac monopole potential, which is induced on the sphere in theinequivalent quantizations, turns out to be the Wess-Zumino term in the entireconfiguration space.
