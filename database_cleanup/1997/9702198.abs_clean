We discuss five-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. An anomaly renderssome theories inconsistent and others consistent only upon including aWess-Zumino type Chern-Simons term. We discuss some necessary conditions forexistence of nontrivial renormalization group fixed points and find allpossible gauge groups and matter content which satisfy them. In some cases, theexistence of these fixed points can be inferred from string dualityconsiderations. In other cases, they arise from M-theory on Calabi-Yauthreefolds. We explore connections between aspects of the gauge theory andCalabi-Yau geometry. A consequence of our classification of field theories withnontrivial fixed points is a fairly complete classification of a class ofsingularities of Calabi-Yau threefolds which generalize the ``del Pezzocontractions'' and occur at higher codimension walls of the K\"{a}hler cone.
