Title: On Zero-Mass Ground States in Super-Membrane Matrix Models

Authors: J. Froehlich, J. Hoppe (ETH Zuerich)

Comments: 16 pp., LaTex

We recall a formulation of super-membrane theory in terms of certain matrixmodels. These models are known to have a mass spectrum given by the positivehalf-axis. We show that, for the simplest such matrix model, a normalizablezero-mass ground state does not exist.
