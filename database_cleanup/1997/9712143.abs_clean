We reconstruct non-trivial 6d theories obtained by Blum and Intriligator byconsidering IIB or SO(32) 5 branes at ALE spaces in the language of HananyWitten setups. Using ST duality we make the equivalence of the two approachesmanifest, thereby uncovering several new T-duality relations between the grouptheoretic data describing the embedding of the instantonic 5 brane in the ALEand brane positions in the Hanany Witten language. We construct several new 6dtheories, which can be understood as arising on 5 branes in IIB orientifoldswith oppositely charged orientifold planes recently introduced by Witten.
