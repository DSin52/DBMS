Title: Exact Local Supersymmetry, Absence of Superpartners, and Noncommutative

GeometriesComments: 16 pages, LaTex

It is pointed out that if we allow for the possibility of a multilayereduniverse, it is possible to maintain exact supersymmetry and arrange, inprinciple, for the vanishing of the cosmological constant. Superpartner(s) of aknown particle will then be associated with the other layers of such auniverse. A concrete model realizing this scenario is exhibited in \2dimensions, and it is suggested that it may be realizable in 3+1 dimensions.The connection between this nonclassical geometry and noncommutative geometriesis discussed.
