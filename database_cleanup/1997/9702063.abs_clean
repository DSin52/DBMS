Title: Supersymmetric Spin Glass

Authors: Sergei Gukov

Comments: latex, 8 pages, 2 Postscript figures

The evidently supersymmetric four-dimensional Wess-Zumino model with quencheddisorder is considered at the one-loop level. The infrared fixed points of abeta-function form the moduli space $M = RP^2$ where two types of phases werea trivial fixed point, this point become unstable in the latter phase which maybe interpreted as a spin glass phase.
