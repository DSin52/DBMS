Title: BPS Solitons and Killing Spinors in Three Dimensional N=2 Supergravity

Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX. Short Talk given at the Meeting ``Trends in

Theoretical Physics'', April 28th-May 6th, 1997, La Plata, ArgentinaIn the framework of three dimensional extended supergravity theories, wedemonstrate that there exist non-trivial Killing spinors over BPS solitonconfigurations, even when the space-time is asymptotically conical. We alsoshow that there are no physical fermionic zero modes on these backgrounds. Wefurther generalize these results to the case of semilocal systems.
