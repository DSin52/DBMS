We show that the D=6 SU(2) gauged supergravity of van Nieuwenhuizen et al,obtained by dimensional reduction of the D=7 topologically massive gaugedsupergravity and previously thought not to be dimensionally reducible, can befurther reduced to five and four dimensions. On reduction to D=4 one recoversthe special case of the SU(2)XSU(2) gauged supergravity of Freedman and Schwarzfor which one of the SU(2) coupling constants vanishes. Previously knownsupersymmetric electrovacs of this model then imply new ground states in 7-D.We construct a supersymmetric electrovac solution of N=2 SU(2) gaugedsupergravity in 7-D. We also investigate the domain wall solutions of thesetheories and show they preserve a half of the supersymmetry.
