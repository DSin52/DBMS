We derive four dimensional gauge theories with exceptional groups $F_4$,$E_8$, $E_7$, and $E_7$ with matter, by starting from the duality between theheterotic string on $K3$ and F-theory on a elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau3-fold. This configuration is compactified to four dimensions on a torus, andby employing toric geometry, we compute the type IIB mirrors of the Calabi-Yausof the type IIA string theory. We identify the Seiberg-Witten curves describingthe gauge theories as ALE spaces fibered over a $P^1$ base.
