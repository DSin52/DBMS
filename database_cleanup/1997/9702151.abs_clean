Comments: 3 minor changes; 17 pgs, epsf & aps styles,1 eps & 2 embedded ps figs

The existence of run-away solutions in classical and non-relativistic quantumelectrodynamics is reviewed. It is shown that the less singular high energybehavior of relativistic spin 1/2 quantum electrodynamics precludes ananalogous behavior in that theory. However, a Landau-like anomalous pole in thephoton propagation function or in the electron-massive photon foward scatteringamplitude would generate a new run-away, characterized by an energy scale omega~ m_e exp (1/alpha). This contrasts with the energy scale omega ~ (m_e/alpha)associated with the classical and non-relativistic quantum run-aways.
