Title: Higher Dimensional Analogues of Donaldson-Witten Theory

Comments: 23 Pages, Latex. Our statement that these theories are independent of

the metric is corrected to the statement that the theories are invariantunder deformations that preserve the holonomy structure of the manifold. Wealso include more details of the construction of a higher dimensionalanalogue of Floer theory. Three references are addedJournal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B503 (1997) 657-674

We present a Donaldson-Witten type field theory in eight dimensions onmanifolds with $Spin(7)$ holonomy. We prove that the stress tensor is BRSTexact for metric variations preserving the holonomy and we give the invariantsfor this class of variations. In six and seven dimensions we propose similartheories on Calabi-Yau threefolds and manifolds of $G_2$ holonomy respectively.We point out that these theories arise by considering supersymmetric Yang-Millstheory defined on such manifolds. The theories are invariant under metricvariations preserving the holonomy structure without the need for twisting.This statement is a higher dimensional analogue of the fact thatDonaldson-Witten field theory on hyper-K\"ahler 4-manifolds is topologicalwithout twisting. Higher dimensional analogues of Floer cohomology are brieflyoutlined. All of these theories arise naturally within the context of stringtheory.
