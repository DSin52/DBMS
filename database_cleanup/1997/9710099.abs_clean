A free field representation for the type $I$ vertex operators and the cornertransfer matrices of the eight-vertex model is proposed. The construction usesthe vertex-face correspondence, which makes it possible to express correlationfunctions of the eight-vertex model in terms of correlation functions of theSOS model with a nonlocal insertion. This new nonlocal insertion admits of afree field representation in terms of Lukyanov's screening operator. Thespectrum of the corner transfer matrix and the Baxter--Kelland formula for theaverage staggered polarization have been reproduced.
