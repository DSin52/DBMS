Authors: L.E.Ibanez, A.M.Uranga

Comments: 52 pages, plain Latex. To appear in the proceedings of the APCTP

Winter School on Duality, Mt. Sorak (Korea), February 1997We review the structure $D=6, N=1$ string vacua with emphasis on thedifferent connections due to T-dualities and S-dualities. The topics discussedcompactifications; T-dualities between $E_8\times E_8$ and $Spin(32)/Z_2$heterotic vacua; non-perturbative heterotic vacua and small instantons; N=2Type-II/Heterotic duality in D=4 ; F-theory/heterotic duality in D=6; andheterotic/heterotic duality in six and four dimensions.
