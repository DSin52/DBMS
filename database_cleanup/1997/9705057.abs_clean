We study the leading irrelevant operators along the flat directions ofcertain supersymmetric theories. In particular, we focus on finite N=2(including N=4) supersymmetric field theories in four dimensions and showthat these operators are completely determined by the symmetries of theproblem. This shows that they are generated only at one loop and are notrenormalized beyond this order. An instanton computation in similar threedimensional theories shows that these terms are renormalized. Hence, the fourdimensional non-renormalization theorem of these terms is not valid in threedimensions.
