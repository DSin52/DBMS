The quantum integrability of a class of massive perturbations of theparafermionic conformal field theories associated to compact Lie groups isestablished by showing that they have quantum conserved densities of scaledimension 2 and 3. These theories are integrable for any value of a continuousvector coupling constant, and they generalize the perturbation of the minimalparafermionic models by their first thermal operator. The classicalequations-of-motion of these perturbed theories are the non-abelian affine Todaequations which admit (charged) soliton solutions whose semi-classicalquantization is expected to permit the identification of the exact S-matrix ofthe theory.
