We propose doubly supersymmetric actions in terms of n=2(D-2) worldlinesuperfields for N=2 superparticles in D=3,4 and Type IIA D=6 superspaces. Theseactions are obtained by dimensional reduction of superfield actions for N=1superparticles in D=4,6 and 10, respectively. We show that in all these modelsgeometrodynamical constraints on target superspace coordinates do not put thetheory on the mass shell, so the actions constructed consistently describe thedynamics of the corresponding N=2 superparticles. We also find that in contrastto the IIA D=6 superparticle a chiral IIB D=6 superparticle, which is notobtainable by dimensional reduction from N=1, D=10, is described by superfieldconstraints which produce dynamical equations. This implies that for the IIBD=6 superparticle the doubly supersymmetric action does not exist in theconventional form.
