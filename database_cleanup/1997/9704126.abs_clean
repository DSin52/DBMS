We construct a new supersymmetric two boson (sTB-B) hierarchy and study itsproperties. We derive the conserved quantities and the Hamiltonian structures(proving the Jacobi identity) for the system. We show how this system gives thesKdV-B equation and its Hamiltonian structures upon appropriate reduction. Wealso describe the zero curvature formulation of this hierarchy both in thesuperspace as well as in components.
