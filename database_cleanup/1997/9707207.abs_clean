We show that there exist nonlinearly realised duality symmetries that areindependent of the standard supergravity global symmetries, and which provideactive spectrum-generating symmetries for the fundamental BPS solitons. Theadditional ingredient, in any spacetime dimension, is a single scalingtransformation that allows one to map between BPS solitons with differentmasses. Without the inclusion of this additional transformation, which is asymmetry of the classical equations of motion, but not the action, it is notpossible to find a spectrum-generating symmetry. The necessity of includingthis scaling transformation highlights the vulnerability of duality multipletsto quantum anomalies. We argue that fundamental BPS solitons may be immune tothis threat.
