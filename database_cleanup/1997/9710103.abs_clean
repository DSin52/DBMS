We discuss random matrix models in terms of elementary operations on Blue'sfunctions (functional inverse of Green's functions). We show that suchoperations embody the essence of a number of physical phenomena whether at/oraway from the critical points. We illustrate these assertions by borrowing on anumber of recent results in effective QCD in vacuum and matter. We providesimple physical arguments in favor of the universality of the continuum QCDspectral oscillations, whether at zero virtuality, in the bulk of the spectrumor at the chiral critical points. We also discuss effective quantum systems ofdisorder with strong or weak dissipation (Hatano-Nelson localization).
