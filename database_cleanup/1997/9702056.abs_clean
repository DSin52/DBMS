I define central functions c(g) and c'(g) in quantum field theory, useful tostudy the flow of the numbers of vector, spinor and scalar degrees of freedomfrom the UV limit to the IR limit and basic ingredients for a description ofquantum field theory as an interpolating theory between pairs of 4D conformalfield theories. The key importance of the correlator of four stress-energytensors is outlined in this respect. Then I focus the analysis on thebehaviours of the central functions in QCD, computing their slopes in the UVcritical point. To two-loops, c(g) and c'(g) point towards the expected IRdirections. As a possible physical application, I argue that a closer study ofthe central functions might allow us to lower the upper bound on the number ofgenerations to the observed value. Candidate all-order expressions for thecentral functions are compared with the predictions of electric-magneticduality.
