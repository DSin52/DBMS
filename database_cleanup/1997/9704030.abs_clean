Matrix string theory (or more generally U-Duality) requires Super Yang-Millstheory to reflect a stringy degeneracy of BPS short multiplets. These are foundas supersymmetric states in the Yang-Mills carrying (fractionated) momentum, orin some cases, instanton number. Their energies also agree with those expectedfrom M(atrix) theory. A nice parallel also emerges in the relevant cases,between momentum and instanton number, (both integral as well as fractional)providing evidence for a recent conjecture relating the two.
