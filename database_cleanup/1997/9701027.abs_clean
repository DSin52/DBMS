A non-dissipative model for vortex motion in thin superconductors isconsidered. The Lagrangian is a Galilean invariant version of theGinzburg--Landau model for time-dependent fields, with kinetic terms linear inthe first time derivatives of the fields. It is shown how, for certain valuesof the coupling constants, the field dynamics can be reduced to first orderdifferential equations for the vortex positions. Two vortices circle around oneanother at constant speed and separation in this model.
