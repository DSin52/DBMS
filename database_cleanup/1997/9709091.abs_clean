We consider Matrix theory compactified on T^3 and show that it correctlydescribes the properties of Schwarzschild black holes in 7+1 dimensions,including the energy-entropy relation, the Hawking temperature and the physicalsize, up to numerical factors of order unity. The most economical descriptioninvolves setting the cut-off N in the discretized light-cone quantization to beof order the black hole entropy. A crucial ingredient necessary for our work isthe recently proposed equation of state for 3+1 dimensional SYM theory with 16supercharges. We give detailed arguments for the range of validity of thisequation following the methods of Horowitz and Polchinski.
