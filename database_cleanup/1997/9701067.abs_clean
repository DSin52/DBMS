We find that the local character of field theory requires the parity degreeof freedom of the fields to be considered as an additional dicrete fifthdimension which is an artifact emerging due to the local description ofspace-time. Higgs field arises as the gauge field corresponding to thisdiscrete dimension. Hence the noncommutative geometric derivation of thestandard model follows as a manifestation of the local description of the usualspace-time.
