We consider configurations of rotated NS-branes leading to a family offour-dimensional N=1 super-QCD theories, interpolating between four-dimensionalanalogues of the Hanany-Witten vacua, and the Elitzur-Giveon-Kutasovconfiguration for N=1 duality. The rotation angle is the N=2 breakingparameter, the mass of the adjoint scalar in the N=2 vector multiplet. We addsome comments on the relevance of these configurations as possible stringyproofs of N=1 duality.
