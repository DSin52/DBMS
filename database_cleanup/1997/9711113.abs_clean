Employing factorized versions of characters as products of quantumdilogarithms corresponding to irreducible representations of the Virasoroalgebra, we obtain character formulae which admit an anyonic quasi-particleinterpretation in the context of minimal models in conformal field theories. Wepropose anyonic thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations, together with theircorresponding equation for the Virasoro central charge, on the base of ananalysis of the classical limit for the characters and the requirement that thescattering matrices are asymptotically phaseless.
