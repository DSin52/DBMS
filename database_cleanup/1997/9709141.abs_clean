In this paper we consider classical point particles in full interaction withan arbitrary number of dynamical scalar and (abelian) vector fields. It isshown that the requirement of stability ---vanishing self-force--- isthe divergent self-energy, as well as the failure of Lorentz-covariance of theenergy-momentum when including the contributions of the fields. As a result, inthese models the mass of a point particle becomes finitely computable. It isshown how these models are connected to quantum field theory via thepath-integral representation of the propagator.
