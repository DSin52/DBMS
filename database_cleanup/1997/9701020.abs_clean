We investigate the confining phase vacuum structure of supersymmetric SO(11)gauge theories with one spinor matter field and Nf \le 6 vectors. We describeseveral useful tricks and tools that facilitate the analysis of these chiralmodels and many other theories of similar type. The forms of the Nf=5 and Nf=6quantum moduli spaces are deduced by requiring that they reproduce knownresults for SU(5) SUSY QCD along the spinor flat direction. After adding massterms for vector fields and integrating out heavy degrees of freedom, we alsodetermine the dynamically generated superpotentials in the Nf \le 4 quantumtheories. We close with some remarks regarding magnetic duals to the Nf \ge 7electric SO(11) theories.
