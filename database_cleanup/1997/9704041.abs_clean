M-theory suggests the large N limit of the matrix description of a collectionof N Type IA D-particles should provide a nonperturbative formulation ofheterotic string theory. In this paper states in the matrix theorycorresponding to fundamental heterotic strings are identified, and theirinteractions are studied. Comments are made about analogous states in Type IIAstring theory, which correspond to bound states of D-particles andD-eightbranes.
