An original regular approach to constructing special type symmetries forboundary value problems, namely renormgroup symmetries, is presented. Differentmethods of calculating these symmetries, based on modern group analysis aredescribed. Application of the approach to boundary value problems isdemonstrated with the help of a simple mathematical model.
