This paper investigates the algebraic structure that exists on perturbativeBPS-states in the superstring, compactified on the product of a circle and aCalabi-Yau fourfold. This structure was defined in a recent article by Harveyand Moore. It shown that for a toroidal compactification this algebra isrelated to a generalized Kac-Moody algebra. The BPS-algebra itself is not aLie-algebra. However, it turns out to be possible to construct a Lie-algebrawith the same graded dimensions, in terms of a half-twisted model. Thedimensions of these algebras are related to the elliptic genus of thetransverse part of the string algebra. Finally, the construction is applied toan orbifold compactification of the superstring.
