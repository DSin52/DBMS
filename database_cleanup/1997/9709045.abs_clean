The high-energy quark-quark scattering amplitude is calculated first in thecase of scalar QCD, using Fradkin's approach to derive the scalar quarkpropagator in an external gluon field and computing it in the eikonalapproximation. The results are then extended to the case of ``real'' (i.e.,fermion) QCD. The high-energy quark-quark scattering amplitude turns out to bedescribed by the expectation value of two lightlike Wilson lines, running alongthe classical trajectories of the two colliding particles. Interesting analyticproperties of the high-energy quark-quark scattering amplitude can be derived,evaluating the high-energy scattering amplitude directly on the lattice.
