We discuss N=2 supersymmetric compactifications to four dimensions from thepoint of view of F-theory and heterotic theory. In a relatively simple setup,we illustrate the spectral theory for vector bundles on K3xT^2 and discuss theheterotic -- F-theory map. The moduli space of instantons on the 7-branewrapped around K3 is discussed from the point of view of Higgs mechanism in theeffective four-dimensional N=2 theory. This allows us to elaborate on thetransitions between various branches of the moduli space of theheterotic/F-theory. We also describe the F-theory compactification on smoothK3xK3 without the 3-branes in which the anomaly is cancelled by the gaugefields.
