We construct the Euclidean Green functions for the soliton (magneticmonopole) field in the U(1)_4 Lattice Gauge Theory with Wilson action. We showthat in the strong coupling regime there is monopole condensation while in theQED phase the physical Hilbert space splits into orthogonal soliton sectorslabelled by integer magnetic charge.
