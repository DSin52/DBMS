We propose a systematic method of dealing with the canonical constrainedstructure of reducible systems in the Dirac and symplectic approaches whichinvolves an enlargement of phase and configuration spaces, respectively. It isnot necessary, as in the Dirac approach, to isolate the independent subset ofconstraints or to introduce, as in the symplectic analysis, a series oflagrange multipliers-for-lagrange multipiers. This analysis illuminates theclose connection between the Dirac and symplectic approaches of treatingreducible theories, which is otherwise lacking. The example of p-form gaugefields (p=2,3) is analyzed in details.
