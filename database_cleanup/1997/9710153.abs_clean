Gauge theories are formulated on the noncommutative two-sphere. Thesetheories have only finite number of degrees of freedom, nevertheless theyexhibit both the gauge symmetry and the SU(2) "Poincar\'e" symmetry of thesphere. In particular, the coupling of gauge fields to chiral fermions isnaturally achieved.
