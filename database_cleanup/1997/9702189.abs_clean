Title: Geometrical Construction of Type I Superstring Vacua

Comments: 12 pages, latex, no figures; contribution to the Proceedings of the

12th Italian Conference on General Relativity and Gravitational Physics,Rome, september 23-27, 1996The parameter-space orbifold construction of open and unoriented toroidal and(target-space) orbifold compactifications is briefly reviewed, with emphasis onthe underlying geometrical framework. A class of chiral four-dimensional type-Ivacua with three generations is also discussed.
