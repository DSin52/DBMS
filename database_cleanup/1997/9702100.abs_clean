The basic AB problem is to determine how an unshielded tube of magnetic flux$\Phi$ affects arbitrarily long-wavelength charged particles impinging on it.For spin-1 at almost all $\Phi$ the particles do not penetrate the tube, sothe interaction essentially is periodic in $\Phi$ (AB effect). Below-thresholdbound states move freely only along the tube axis, and consequent inducedvacuum currents supplement rather than screen $\Phi$. For a pure magneticinteraction the tube must be broader than the particle Compton wavelength,i.e., only the nonrelativistic spin-1 AB problem exists.
