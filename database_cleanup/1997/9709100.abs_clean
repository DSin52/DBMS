Title: New Developments in the Continuous Renormalization Group

Comments: Invited key talk at NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Theoretical

Jun 1997. 12 pages latex, includes plenum.styOver the last several years, there has been a resurgence of interest in usingnon-perturbative approximation methods based on Wilson's continuousrenormalization group. In this lecture, I review progress particularly in thepast year, concentrating on theoretical issues in the structure of the exactrenormalization group and its approximations.
