We calculate instanton corrections to three dimensional gauge theories withN=4 and N=8 supersymmetry and SU(n) gauge groups. The N=4 results give newinformation about the moduli space of n BPS SU(2) monopoles, including theleading order non-pairwise interaction terms. A few comments are made on therelationship of the N=8 results to membrane scattering in matrix theory.
