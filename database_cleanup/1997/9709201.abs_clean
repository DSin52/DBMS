We exhibit the one-loop multi-gluon effective Lagrangian in any dimension fora field theory with a quasilocal background, using the background-fieldformalism. Specific results, including counter terms (up to 12 spacetimedimensions), have been derived, applied to the Yang-Mills theory and found tobe in agreement with other string-inspired approaches.
