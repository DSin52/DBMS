We present a consistent theory of N=1 supergravity in twelve-dimensions withthe signature (10,2). Even though the formulation uses two null vectorsviolating the manifest Lorentz covariance, all the superspace Bianchiidentities are satisfied. After a simple dimensional reduction toten-dimensions, this theory reproduces the N=1 supergravity in ten-dimensions,supporting the consistency of the system. We also show that our supergravitycan be the consistent backgrounds for heterotic or type-I superstring inGreen-Schwarz formulation, by confirming the kappa-invariance of the totalaction. This theory is supposed to be the purely N=1 supergravity sector forthe field theory limit of the recently predicted F-theory in twelve-dimensions.
