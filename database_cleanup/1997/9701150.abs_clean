We analize instanton generated superpotentials for three dimensional N=2supersymmetric gauge theories obtained by compactifying on S^1 N=1 fourdimensional theories. In the N_f=1 case, we find that the vacua in thedecompactification limit is given by the singular points of the Coulomb branchof the N=2 four dimensional theory (we also consider the massive case). Thedecompactification limit of the superpotential for pure gauge theories withoutchiral matter is interpreted in terms of `t Hooft's fractional instantonamplitudes.
