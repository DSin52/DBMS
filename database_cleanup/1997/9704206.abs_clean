We introduce new local gauge invariant variables for N=1 supersymmetricYang-Mills theory, explicitly parameterizing the physical Hilbert space of thetheory. We show that these gauge invariant variables have a geometricalinterpretation, and can be constructed such that the emergent geometry is thattorsion. Full geometrization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is carriedout, and geometry independent divergences associated to the inversion of adifferential operator with zero modes -- that were encountered in thenon-supersymmetric case -- do not arise in this situation.
