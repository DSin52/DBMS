Starting from a consistency requirement between T-duality symmetry andrenormalization group flows, the two-loop metric beta function is found for ad=2 bosonic sigma model on a generic, torsionless background. The result isobtained without Feynman diagram calculations, and represents further evidencethat duality symmetry severely constrains renormalization flows.
