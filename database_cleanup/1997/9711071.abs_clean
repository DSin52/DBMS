We present a numerical scheme for calculating the first quantum correctionsto the properties of static solitons. The technique is applicable to solitonsof arbitrary shape, and may be used in 3+1 dimensions for multiskyrmions orother complicated solitons. We report on a test computation in 1+1 dimensions,where we accurately reproduce the analytical result with minimal numericaleffort.
