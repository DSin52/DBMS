We perform the dimensional reduction of the nonrelativistic CP(1) modelcoupled to an Abelian Chern-Simons gauge field in the self-dual limit, andinvestigate the soliton and domain wall solutions of the emerging 1+1dimensional self-dual spin system. This system is described by inhomogeneousLandau-Lifshitz system with an extra non-local term. The Hamiltonian isBogomol'nyi bounded from below and has four adjusting parameters. TheBogomol'nyi equation is described in detail in analogy with the Newtonianequation of motion and its numerical solution is presented.
