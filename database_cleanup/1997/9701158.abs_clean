The effective low-energy hyper-K"ahler potential for a massive N=2 matter inthe N=2 super-QCD is investigated. The N=2 extended supersymmetry severelyrestricts that N=2 matter self-couplings so that their exact form can be fixedby a few parameters, which is apparent in the N=2 harmonic superspace. In theN=2 QED with a single matter hypermultiplet, the one-loop perturbativecalculations lead to the Taub-NUT hyper-K"ahler metric in the massive case, anda free metric in the massless case. It is remarkable that the naivenon-renormalization `theorem' does not apply. There exists a manifestly N=2supersymmetric duality transformation converting the low-energy effectiveaction for the N=2 QED hypermultiplet into a sum of the quadratic and theimproved (non-polynomial) actions for an N=2 tensor multiplet. The dualitytransformation also gives a simple connection between the low-energy effectiveaction in the N=2 harmonic superspace and the component results.
