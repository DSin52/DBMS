Title: Degeneration of the Elliptic Algebra $A_{q,p}(\widehat{sl_2})$ and Form

Factors in the sine-Gordon TheoryComments: 21 pages, LaTeX file, Talk given at the Nankai-CRM joint meeting on

"Extended and Quantum Algebras and their Applications to Physics", Tianjin,China, August 19-24, 1996. To appear in the CRM series in mathematicalphysics, Springer VerlagFollowing the work with Jimbo and Miwa, we introduce a certain degenerationof the elliptic algebra $A_{q,p}(\widehat{sl_2})$ and its boson realization. Weinvestigate its rational limit. The limit is the central extension of theYangian double DY(sl_2) at level one. We give a new boson realization of it.Based on these algebras, we reformulate the Smirnov's form factor bootstrapapproach to the sine-Gordon theory and the SU(2) invariant Thirring model. Aconjectural integral formula for form factor in the sine-Gordon theory isderived.
