Two dimensional QCD is bosonized to be an integrably deformedWess-Zumino-Witten model under proper limit. Fermions are identified havingindices of the Grassmann manifold. Conditions for integrability are analyzedand their physical meanings are discussed. We also address the nature of theexactly solvable part of the theory and find the infinitely many conservedquantities.
