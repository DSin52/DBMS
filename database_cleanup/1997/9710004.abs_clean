Title: Orientifolds

Comments: harvmac, 15 pages (b), one eps figure; Review based on talks given at

Puri (Dec 1996) and Paris (Aug 1997)I review some recent developments in our understanding of the dynamics of Z_2orientifolds of type IIA and IIB strings and M-theory. Interesting physicalphenomena that occur in each spacetime dimension from 10 to 1 are summarized,along with some relationships to nonperturbative effects and to M- andM-theory, (ii) exceptional gauge symmetry from open strings, (iii) certainsimilarities between branes and orientifold planes. Some comments are also madeon disconnected components of orientifold moduli space.
