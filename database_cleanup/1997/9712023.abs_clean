We present an explicit method for translating between the linear sigma modeland the spectral cover description of SU(r) stable bundles over an ellipticallyfibered Calabi-Yau manifold. We use this to investigate the 4-dimensionalduality between (0,2) heterotic and F-theory compactifications. We indirectlyfind that much interesting heterotic information must be contained in the`spectral bundle' and in its dual description as a gauge theory on multipleF-theory 7-branes.A by-product of these efforts is a method for analyzing semistability and thesplitting type of vector bundles over an elliptic curve given as the sheafcohomology of a monad.
