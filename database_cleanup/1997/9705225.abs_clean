We study supermembranes in the light-cone gauge in eleven flat dimensionswith compact directions. The membrane states are subject to only the centralcharges associated with closed two-branes, which, in this case, are generatedby the winding itself. We present arguments why this winding leaves the massspectrum continuous. The lower bound on the mass spectrum is set by the windingnumber and corresponds to a BPS state.
