A method which uses a generalized tensorial $\zeta$-function to compute therenormalized stress tensor of a quantum field propagating in a (static) curvedbackground is presented. The starting point of the method is the directcomputation of the functional derivatives of the Euclidean one-loop effectiveaction with respect to the background metric. This method, when available,gives rise to a conserved stress tensor and produces the conformal anomalyformula directly. It is proven that the obtained stress tensor agrees withstatistical mechanics in the case of a finite temperature theory. Therenormalization procedure is controlled by the structure of the poles of thestress-tensor $\zeta$ function. The infinite renormalization is automatic andis due to a ``magic'' cancellation of two poles. The remaining finiterenormalization involves conserved geometrical terms arising by a certainresidue. Such terms renormalize coupling constants of the geometric part ofEinstein's equations (customary generalized through high-order curvatureterms). The method is checked on particular cases (closed and open Einstein`suniverse) finding agreement with other approaches. The method is also checkedconsidering a massless scalar field in the presence of a conical singularity inthe Euclidean manifold (i.e. Rindler spacetimes/large mass black holemanifold/cosmic string manifold). There, the method gives rise to the stresstensor already got by the point-splitting approach for every coupling with thecurvature regardless of the presence of the singular curvature. Comments on themeasure employed in the path integral, the use of the optical manifold anddifferent approaches to renormalize the Hamiltonian are made.
