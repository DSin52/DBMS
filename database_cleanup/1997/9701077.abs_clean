We examine the geometry near the event horizon of a family of black stringsolutions with traveling waves. It has previously been shown that the metric iscontinuous there. Contrary to expectations, we find that the geometry is notsmooth, and the horizon becomes singular whenever a wave is present. Both fivedimensional and six dimensional black strings are considered with similarresults.
