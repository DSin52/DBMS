We show how to bosonize two-dimensional non-abelian models using finitechiral determinants calculated from a Gauss decomposition. The calculation isquite straightforward and hardly more involved than for the abelian case. Inparticular, the counterterm $A\bar A$, which is normally motivated from gaugeinvariance and then added by hand, appears naturally in this approach.
