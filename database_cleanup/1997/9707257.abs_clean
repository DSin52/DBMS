After recalling the precise existence conditions of the zeta function of apseudodifferential operator, and the concept of reflection formula, anexponentially convergent expression for the analytic continuation of amultidimensional inhomogeneous Epstein-type zeta function of the general form\zeta_{A,\vec{b},q} (s) = \sum_{\vec{n}\in Z^p (\vec{n}^T A \vec{n} +\vec{b}^T\vec{n}+q)^{-s}, with $A$ the $p\times p$ matrix of a quadratic form, $\vec{b}$a $p$ vector and $q$ a constant, is obtained. It is valid on the whole complex$s$-plane, is exponentially convergent and provides the residua at the polesexplicitly. It reduces to the famous formula of Chowla and Selberg in theparticular case $p=2$, $\vec{b}= \vec{0}$, $q=0$. Some variations of theformula and physical applications are considered.
