Title: New Approximations to the Fradkin representation for Green's functions

Comments: revtex, 22 pages

A new variant of the exact Fradkin representation of the Green's function$G_c(x,y|gU)$, defined for arbitrary external potential $U$, is presented.Although this new approach is very similar in spirit to that previously derivedby Fried and Gabellini, for certain calculations this specific variant, withits prescribed approximations, is more readily utilizable. Application of thesimplest of these forms is made to the $\lambda\Phi^4$ theory in fourdimensions.As an independent check of these approximate forms, an improved version ofthe Schwinger-DeWitt asymptotic expansion of parametrix function is derived.
