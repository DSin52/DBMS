We study the new ``gauge'' theories in 5+1 dimensions, and theirnon-commutative generalizations. We argue that the $\theta$-term and thenon-commutative torus parameters appear on an equal footing in the non-criticalstring theories which define the gauge theories. The use of these theories as aMatrix description of M-theory on $T^5$, as well as a closely relatedrealization as 5-branes in type IIB string theory, proves useful in studyingsome of their properties.
