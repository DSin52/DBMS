Comments: 38 pages, Latex

These lectures on the Batalin-Vilkovisky method of quantization weredelivered at "VII Mexican School of Particles and Fields", M\'erida, M\'exico,October 30-November 6, 1996.In section II, we study the derivation of BV from Schwinger-Dyson-BRSTsymmetry; in section III, we consider some generalizations of the BV structuresuggested by our approach. In section IV, we present a connection between thePoisson bracket and the antibracket and use it to relate the Nambu bracketcwith the generalized $n$-brackets of section III.
