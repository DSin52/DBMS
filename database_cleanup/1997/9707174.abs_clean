We describe special supersymmetric gauge theories in three, five, seven andnine dimensions, whose compactification on two-, four-, six- and eight-foldsproduces a supersymmetric quantum mechanics on moduli spaces of holomorphicbundles and/or solutions to the analogues of instanton equations in higherdimensions. The theories may occur on the worldvolumes of D-branes wrappingmanifolds of special holonomy. We also discuss the theories with matter.
