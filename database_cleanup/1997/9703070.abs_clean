We construct stringy cosmic string solutions corresponding tocompactifications of F-theory on several elliptic Calabi-Yau manifolds bysolving the equations of motion of low energy effective action of tendimensional type IIB superstring theory. Existence of such solutions supportsthe compactifications of F-theory.
