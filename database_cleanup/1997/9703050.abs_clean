Starting with the representation of the Wilson average in the Euclidean 4Dcompact QED as a partition function of the Universal Confining String Theory,we derive for it the corresponding loop equation, alternative to the familiarone.In the functional momentum representation the obtained equation decouples intotwo independent ones, which describe the dynamics of the transverse andlongitudinal components of the area derivative of the Wilson loop. At somecritical value of the momentum discontinuity, which can be determined from acertain equation, the transverse component does not propagate.Next, we derive the equation for the momentum Wilson loop, where on theleft-hand side stands the sum of the squares of the momentum discontinuities,multiplied by the loop, which describes its free propagation, while theright-hand side describes the interaction of the loop with the functionalvorticity tensor current.Finally, using the method of inversion of the functional Laplacian, we obtainfor the Wilson loop in the coordinate representation a simple Volterra type-IIlinear integral equation, which can be treated perturbatively.
