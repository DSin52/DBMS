Operator quantization of the WZNW theory invariant with respect to an affineKac-Moody algebra $\hat g$ with constrained $\hat {u}(1)^d$ currents isperformed using Dirac's procedure. Upon quantization the initialenergy-momentum tensor is replaced by the $g/u(1)^d$ coset construction. The$\hat {su}(2)$ WZNW  theory with a constrained $\hat u(1)$ current isequivalent to the $su(2)/u(1)$ conformal field theory.
