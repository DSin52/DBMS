On a nonrelativistic contact four-fermion model we have shown that the simpleLambda-cut-off prescription together with definite fine-tuning of the Lambdadependency of "bare"quantities lead to self-adjoint semi-bounded Hamiltonian inone-, two- and three-particle sectors. The fixed self-adjoint extension andexact solutions in two-particle sector completely define three-particleproblem. The renormalized Faddeev equations for the bound states with Fredholmproperties are obtained and analyzed.
