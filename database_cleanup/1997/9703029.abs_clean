We give some simple examples of mirror Calabi-Yau fourfolds in Type II stringtheory. These are realised as toroidal orbifolds. Motivated by the Strominger,Yau, Zaslow argument we give explicitly the mirror transformation which mapsType IIA/IIB on such a fourfold to Type IIA/IIB on the mirror. The mirrors arerelated by the inclusion/exclusion of discrete torsion. Implicit in the resultis a confirmation of mirror symmetry to genus $g$ in the string path integral.Finally, by considering the relationship between M-theory and Type IIA theory,we show how in M-theory on mirror Calabi-Yau fourfolds, mirror symmetryexchanges the Coulomb branch with (one of the) Higgs branches of the theory.This result is relevant to duality in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories inthree dimensions.
