An "expanded" description is introduced to examine the spinor-monopoleidentification proposed by Strassler for four-dimensional $\cal N$ = 1supersymmetric Spin(10) gauge theories with matter in F vector and N spinorrepresentations. It is shown that a Z_2 monopole in the "expanded" theory isassociated with massive spinors of the Spin(10) theory. For N=2, two spinorcase, we confirm this identification by matching the transformation propertiesof the two theories under SU(2) flavor symmetry. However, for N $\ge$ 3, thetransformation properties are not matched between the spinors and the monopole.This disagreement might be due to the fact that the SU(N) flavor symmetry ofthe Spin(10) theory is partially realized as an SU(2) symmetry in the"expanded" theory.
