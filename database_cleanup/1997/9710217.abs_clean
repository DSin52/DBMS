The recent suggestion that the entropy of Schwarzschild black holes can becomputed in matrix theory using near-extremal D-brane thermodynamics isexamined. It is found that the regime in which this approach is valid actuallydescribes black strings stretched across the longitudinal direction, near thetransition where black strings become unstable to the formation of black holes.It is argued that the appropriate dynamics on the other (black hole) side ofthe transition is that of the zero modes of the corresponding super Yang-Millstheory. A suggestive mean field theory argument is given for the entropy ofblack holes in all dimensions. Consequences of the analysis for matrix theoryand the holographic principle are discussed.
