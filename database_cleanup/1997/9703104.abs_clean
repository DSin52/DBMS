The new extensions of the Poincar\'e superalgebra recently found in ten andeleven dimensions are shown to admit a linear realization. The generators ofthe nonlinear and linear group transformations are shown to fall intoequivalent representations of the superalgebra. The parametrization of thecoset space $G/H$, with $G$ a given extended supergroup and $H$ the Lorentzsubgroup, that corresponds to the linear transformations is presented.
