We study the general equations determining BPS Black Holes by using aSolvable Lie Algebra representation for the homogenous scalar manifold U/H ofextended supergravity. In particular we focus on the N=8 case and we perform ageneral group theoretical analysis of the Killing spinor equation enforcing theBPS condition. Its solutions parametrize the U-duality orbits of BPS solutionsthat are characterized by having 40 of the 70 scalars fixed to constant values.These scalars belong to hypermultiplets in the N=2 decomposition of the N=8theory. Indeed it is shown that those decompositions of the Solvable Liealgebra into appropriate subalgebras which are enforced by the existence of BPSblack holes are the same that single out consistent truncations of the N=8theory to intereacting theories with lower supersymmetry. As an exemplificationof the method we consider the simplified case where the only non-zero fieldsare in the Cartan subalgebra H of Solv(U/H) and correspond to the radii ofstring toroidal compactification. Here we derive and solve the mixed system offirst and second order non linear differential equations obeyed by the metricand by the scalar fields. So doing we retrieve the generating solutions ofheterotic black holes with two charges. Finally, we show that the general N=8generating solution is based on the 6 dimensional solvable subalgebra Solv[(SL(2,\IR) /U(1))^3].
