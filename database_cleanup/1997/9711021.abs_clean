Title: Interaction of D-branes on orbifolds and massless particle emission

Authors: Faheem Hussain, Roberto Iengo, Carmen Nunez and Claudio A. Scrucca

Comments: 16 pages, LaTex, 5 figures. Talk presented by C. A. Scrucca at the

Valencia; to appear in the proceedingsWe discuss various D-brane configurations in 4-dimensional orbifoldcompactifications of type II superstring theory which are point-like 0-branesfrom the 4-dimensional space-time point of view. We analyze their interactionsand compute the amplitude for the emission of a massless NSNS boson from them,in the case where the branes have a non vanishing relative velocity. In thelarge distance limit, we compare our computation to the expected field theoryresults, finding complete agreement.
