We review the fundamentals of Jahn-Teller interactions and their fieldtheoretical modelings and show that a 2+1 dimensional gauge theory where thegauge field couples to "flavored fermions" arises in a natural way from atwo-band model describing the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect. The theory exhibitsa second order phase transition to novel finite-temperature superconductivity.
