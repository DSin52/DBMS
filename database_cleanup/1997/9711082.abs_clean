The nature of M-theory on K3 X I, where I is a line interval, is considered,with a view towards formulating a `matrix theory' representation of thatsituation. Various limits of this compactification of M-theory yield a numberof well known N=1 six dimensional compactifications of the heterotic and type Istring theories. Geometrical relations between these limits give rise tostring/string dualities between some of these compactifications. At a specialpoint in the moduli space of compactifications, this motivates a partialdefinition of the matrix theory representation of the M-theory on K3 X I as thelarge N limit of a certain type IA orientifold model probed by a conglomerateof N D-branes. Such a definition in terms of D-branes and orientifold planes issuggestive, but necessarily incomplete, due to the low amount of superymmetry.It is proposed - following hints from the orientifold model - that the completematrix theory representation of the K3 X I compactified M-theory is given bythe large N limit of compactification - on a suitable `dual' surface - of the`little heterotic string' N = 1 six dimensional quantum theories.
