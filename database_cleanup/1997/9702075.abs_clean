We study the emission of scalar particles from a class of near-extremal fivedimensional black holes and the corresponding D-brane configuration at highenergies. We show that the distribution functions and the black hole greybodyfactors are modified in the high energy tail of the Hawking spectrum in suchway that the emission rates exactly match. We extend the results to chargedscalar emission and to four dimensions.
