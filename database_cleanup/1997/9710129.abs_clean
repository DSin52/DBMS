We determine the possible fractions of supersymmetry preserved by twointersecting M-5-branes. These include the fractions 3/32 and 5/32 which havenot occurred previously in intersecting brane configurations. Both occur innon-orthogonal pointlike intersections of M-5-branes but 5/32 supersymmetry ispossible only for specific fixed angles.
