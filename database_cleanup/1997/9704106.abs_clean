QCD is constructed as a lattice gauge theory in which the elements of thelink matrices are represented by non-commuting operators acting in a Hilbertspace. The resulting quantum link model for QCD is formulated with a fifthEuclidean dimension, whose extent resembles the inverse gauge coupling of theresulting four-dimensional theory after dimensional reduction. The inclusion ofquarks is natural in Shamir's variant of Kaplan's fermion method, which doesnot require fine-tuning to approach the chiral limit. A rishon representationin terms of fermionic constituents of the gluons is derived and the quantumlink Hamiltonian for QCD with a U(N) gauge symmetry is expressed in terms ofglueball, meson and constituent quark operators. The new formulation of QCD ispromising both from an analytic and from a computational point of view.
