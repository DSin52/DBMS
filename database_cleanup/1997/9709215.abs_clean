Title: The path towards manifest background independence

Authors: Sabbir Rahman

Comments: 9 pages, phyzzx

The set of string vertices is extended to include moduli spaces with genusand numbers of ordinary and special punctures ranging over all integral values$g,n,\bar n\geq0$. It is argued that both the string background and the B-Vdelta operator should be associated with the vertex $\B^0_{0,1}$ correspondingto the once-punctured sphere. This leads naturally to the proposal that themanifestly background independent formulation of quantum closed string fieldtheory is given by the sum $\B$ of the completed set of string verticessatisfying the classical master equation $\{\B,\B\}=0$.
