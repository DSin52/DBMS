Using Wegner-Houghton equation, within the Local Potential Approximation, westudy critical properties of O(N) vector models. Fixed Points, together withtheir critical exponents and eigenoperators, are obtained for a large set ofvalues of N, including N=0 and N\to\infty. Polchinski equation is also treated.The peculiarities of the large N limit, where a line of Fixed Points at d=2+2/nis present, are studied in detail. A derivation of the equation is presentedtogether with its projection to zero modes.
