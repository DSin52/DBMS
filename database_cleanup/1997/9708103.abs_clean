We construct general static black hole configuration for the theory of N=2,d=5 supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of Abelian vector multiplets.The underlying very special geometry structure plays a major role in thisconstruction. From the viewpoint of M-theory compactified on a Calabi-Yauthreefold, these black holes are identified with BPS winding states of themembrane around 2-cycles of the Calabi-Yau threefold, and thus are ofimportance in the probing of the phase transitions in the moduli space ofM-theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold.
